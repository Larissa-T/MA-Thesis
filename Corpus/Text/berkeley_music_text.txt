A small portion of the great variety of music studied, created, and performed in the Department of Music by students and faculty is sampled on this page. The sounds of Italian opera, Caribbean popular music, jazz, and Baroque music often mingle in the corridor of Morrison Hall. Each semester in Hertz Hall new works by faculty, graduate, and undergraduate composers are performed, department ensembles play noon and evening concerts of European orchestral, choral, and chamber works, as well as chamber music, improvisation in a variety of styles, gospel, and presentations of music and dance from West Africa and Indonesia. Frequent concerts of new music are also held at CNMAT.Unless otherwise noted, all sound clips are 30-40 sec excerpts in mp3 format.Outside Music (307kb)San Francisco Contemporary Music Players; David Milnes, ConductorTimeless Pulse (551kb)David Wessel, electronics

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Music Department offers undergraduate majors and minors in music, and graduate M.A./Ph.D. and Ph.D. degrees in music composition, ethnomusicology, and music history and literature.At the undergraduate level we offer pre-professional training for those seeking a career in some sphere of music. For those with other career goals but who understand the part that music can play in the quality of our lives, we offer substantive grounding and a lasting source of enrichment. Specialized studies at the M.A-Ph.D. level focus on scholarship (the history and literature of Western music and ethnomusicology) and composition.We are a department (not a School of Music) within the College of Letters and Science, with an internationally-respected faculty who believe that excellence in teaching flows from excellence in scholarly and creative work. If there is one word that describes our pedagogical philosophy, it is “integration”: integration in the curriculum of all the spheres of music study that we teach, so that all our undergraduate students acquire musical competence and experience historical and cultural studies, music theory, composition and improvisation, and of course performance.© 2017 UC Regents.

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Department of Music at Berkeley is one of the oldest and most prominent in the country, bringing together a renowned group of composers, scholars, and performers. The graduate program is ranked among the top in the nation. The department offers the M.A./Ph.D. and the Ph.D. degrees (for those who have previously completed a Master’s degree) in composition and scholarship, the latter with options in the history and literature of Western music and in ethnomusicology. The Music Department does not offer the terminal M.A. degree. The program provides graduate students with a solid mastery of their discipline while cultivating a sense of intellectual and creative independence. Students are free to explore related fields of study both within the music program itself and in the larger university. Graduates of the Berkeley Music Department play prominent roles in distinguished musical institutions across the nation and abroad.Students are supported by fellowships and teaching opportunities. A typical funding package consists of tuition plus a stipend guaranteed for five years (M.A./Ph.D.) or four years (Ph.D.). Additional support for summers and research travel is available by application.Students in composition  are encouraged to create music that is personal both in style and content while building a firm technical foundation. Composition is taught through seminars and independent studies by all composers on the faculty. Opportunities exist for public performances of student compositions, including chamber, vocal, and orchestral works. Facilities are available for work in electronic and computer music.  For more information, view the Graduate Student Handbook.Students in ethnomusicology prepare for ethnographic research, through the study of cultural theory and methodology from various disciplines. Each student’s program is individually designed in consultation with an advisor, including opportunities for drawing on Berkeley’s considerable resources in related disciplines and area studies. For more information, view the Graduate Student Handbook.Students in the history and literature program gain skills for historical research while developing a sense of critical inquiry and intellectual independence. The M.A. program introduces students to musicological methods and techniques and at the same time seeks to broaden their horizons through a variety of courses, including analysis and ethnomusicology. The Ph.D. involves more detailed work in research seminars and special studies. Dissertation topics at Berkeley have run the gamut of scholarly approaches and subjects, from source studies to theoretical or critical works, and from early medieval chant to the music of the present day. For more information, view the Graduate Student Handbook.The period of study in all areas of specialization is from three to (more typically) four semesters ending with the M.A. comprehensive examination. The general course requirement for the M.A. is 24 units, at least 12 of which must be in the graduate series in music.Since the Ph.D. degree is awarded for original, creative achievement, not for the mere completion of a course of study, course and unit requirements are not rigidly prescribed. There is an academic residence requirement of two years. The amount of time needed to complete the Ph.D. varies considerably from one student to another, but students are encouraged to proceed as fast as they can and as the nature of their doctoral project allows. It is expected that the typical student (having obtained an M.A. degree) will have pursued sufficient course work, fulfilled all the supplementary requirements, and taken the qualifying examination, advanced to candidacy, and completed a prospectus for the doctoral project by the end of two years.  After this time the only requirement is that the student satisfactorily complete the doctoral project.The traditional career for Ph.D.s in music has been university and college teaching. There are also other professional activities for which a Ph.D. in music is desirable, such as editing, criticism, arts management, music technology, and professional composing.Members of the faculty provide advice on career planning, dossiers, and interviews, as well as recommendations for job candidacies. Berkeley Ph.D.s are likely to compete successfully for positions at leading institutions. Competition, however, is keen and advisors work closely with students to help them plan a course of study that reflects the realities of the job market.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedPlease begin an application to view all of the requirements, including a Statement of Purpose, Personal History Statement, Transcripts, Test Scores, Examples of Scholarship, and Letters of Recommendation.The Department of Music offers a combined M.A./Ph.D. program and a Ph.D. program (for students who already possess an M.A. in Music with an appropriate emphasis), with specialties in composition, history and literature of Western music, and ethnomusicology. A terminal M.A. degree is not offered. The most appropriate preparation for the graduate program is a B.A. in Music. Applications are considered once a year for admission for the Fall Semester only. Students will be notified of the admission decisions by e-mail no later than March 1st.An audition or a formal interview is not required. Applicants who would like to visit the department should contact faculty members in their fields of interest directly. Applicants who are offered admission will be invited to visit the department in February before deciding whether to accept the offer.If you have any questions, contact our Graduate Student Services Advisor at musicgradadvisor@berkeley.edu.© 2017 UC Regents.

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe department has as one of its principal goals the preparation of teachers for colleges and universities. Every effort is made to ensure that graduates have the knowledge, imagination, and musical and pedagogical skills to enable them to inform and inspire others.An unusual feature of the program, and a major advantage for students at Berkeley, is the number and variety of courses in which they are given employment and in which they teach under faculty supervision. Teaching experience of this kind is both a philosophical and practical aim of the program and a means of student support. The department employs graduate students (normally after their first year of study) as graduate student instructors in courses in European music history and appreciation, American music cultures, ear training, harmony, computer music, chorus, and orchestra.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe approaches taken to the field of ethnomusicology differ widely. Here at Berkeley we try to achieve a balance — between theory and practice of music on the one hand, and between theory and methodology of the field of ethnomusicology and a student’s research specialization on the other. Established in 1975-1976, we are one of the oldest ethnomusicology programs in the United States and are situated in a distinguished music department in the College of Letters and Science. We admit a small number of students, but hope for successful completion by all.At UC Berkeley, graduate degrees with a primary specialization in ethnomusicology are offered only through the Department of Music. However, it is possible to take “a field” in ethnomusicology as part of the graduate program in anthropology, and ethnomusicology faculty work with students in a number of other degree programs.Specialization in ethnomusicology begins at the M.A. level. If a prospective student has already achieved an M.A. degree in a specialization with substantially different course work, ethnomusicology study at Berkeley will lead first to an additional M.A. degree, then on to the Ph.D. program. Students with M.A. degrees in ethnomusicology from another institution are also welcome to apply. Each student’s degree program is individually designed in consultation with the advisor. That program consists of courses in our Department, and also courses in supporting disciplines and area studies.Ethnomusicologists on the faculty of the Department of Music are Benjamin Brinner, Jocelyne Guilbault, and Tamara Roberts. The Central Javanese Gamelan is directed by Midiyanto, Doniel Mark Wilson conducts the Gospel Choir, and C.K. Ladzekpo directs the African Music Ensemble. In addition, artists from the Bay Area offer instruction in various musical traditions, through performance labs for each ethnomusicology lecture course.In addition to course enrollment, we encourage our students to establish intellectual connections with faculty and with other graduate students on campus through such means as the Townsend Center for the Humanities, area studies centers, such as the Center for African Studies, Center for Eastern European, Slavic, and Eurasian Studies, Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Center for Latin American Studies, Center for South Asian Studies, Center for Southeast Asia Studies, Center for Chinese Studies, Center for Korean Studies, Center for Japanese Studies, and centers and programs with particular foci such as the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture, the Center for International Development, and the Institute for the Study of Social Change.Beyond the campus, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area is particularly rich in performances and exhibitions of the world’s cultures. The Bay Area’s rich musical life and its diverse array of performing organizations reflects a complete spectrum of musical activity, such as the Ali Akbar College of Music, numerous venues for performance of a wide range of musics from around the world including western classical opera, symphonies, and ballets, as well as a panoply of popular music, folk music, and great jazz venues such as Freight and Salvage, La Peña, and Ashkenaz in Berkeley, Kimball’s in Emeryville, and Yoshi’s in Oakland.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedOur broad program offers depth in developing the creative musician of the future as composers, composer-performers, improvisers, and composers with special emphasis in technology. Our program aims to prepare students for professional lives as professional practicing artists and as academics.The works of the composition faculty (Franck Bedrossian, Edmund Campion, Cindy Cox, Myra Melford, and Ken Ueno) are heard regularly around the world, and their presence is deeply embedded into the cultural life of the San Francisco Bay area. Our graduate composers have regular opportunities to hear their music performed by the professional Eco Ensemble through the Berkeley New Music Project (BNMP), conducted by David Milnes. In partnership with the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) directed by Edmund Campion, students may work with innovative computer technologies.The department sponsors residencies, workshops and readings with world-class ensembles such as the Ensemble Intercontemporain and the Arditti Quartet. Through the Regent’s Lecture series and the Bloch Lecture series, we invite prominent composers for extended visits. Recent years have seen our students interacting and learning from Pulitzer Prize winning composers such as William Bolcom and Steven Stuckey, as well as international luminaries like Steve Reich, Jonathan Harvey, Philippe Leroux, Magnus Lindberg, Steve Mackey, and John Adams. Our composition faculty produces a weekly colloquium series which further exposes our students to prominent composers visiting the Bay Area. Many students develop strong ties to professional new music groups and go on to have works programmed by ensembles such as the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, the Oakland Symphony, the Earplay Ensemble, and the Empyrean Ensemble. The composition faculty mentor and support students through help arranging these opportunities, and attend their performances and readings with the goal of guiding the development of their professional careers. The composition faculty also assists graduate composers in fundraising for their creative projects, and graduate students are represented by the student-led Berkeley New Music Project (BNMP).In their first year of graduate study the students participate in a two-semester composition seminar where their writing is evaluated and critiqued in a supportive environment. After the first year, the students are required to enroll every semester in private lessons. We frequently offer special seminars on topics of interest to particular faculty. The program (from MA through the completion of the PhD) usually requires about five years to complete.We encourage our students to seek interaction and collaboration on all levels in the university. Students are encouraged to pursue inter-disciplinary studies both inside and outside the department. Many of our distinguished recent graduates have defined themselves by working closely with the ethnomusicology and history sectors of the department or through significant contact with other departments on campus. Composers have collaborated successfully with the Consortium for the Arts, the Townsend Center for the Humanities, the Pacific Film Archive, the Berkeley Art Museum and Cal Performances (Tempo Festival and Edge Festival). Through CNMAT the graduate composers regularly interact and collaborate with students and faculty from the Department of Psychology, Computer Science and Engineering as well as the Department of Theater and Dance.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe study of musicology as it is practiced at Berkeley values critical and sustained engagement with musical works, studied in relation to the historical and social conditions that shaped their genesis and to the meanings ascribed to them by diverse audiences at the time of their creation and since. Graduate students are encouraged to become conversant with related fields such as anthropology, history, literature, cultural studies, and sociology through formal or individual study. Yet the study of music, musicians, listeners, and the mechanisms that create and disseminate music remain at the center of our course of study. We aim for a balance between the study of historical and social factors that shape music (and are shaped by it in turn) and a deep and detailed probing of musical texts. If our approach to teaching music history and to practicing it in our research differs from more general definitions of the field, it is in a tacit belief in music’s agency on political and social levels, a conviction that music’s multiple meanings are recoverable through research and attentive listening, and a commitment to the details and texture of the musical work itself, as experienced both in the score and in performance.Coursework in both the M.A./Ph.D. and the Ph.D. program begin with pro-seminars devoted to research methods, musicological thought, and (in the second year) ethnomusicology. From the outset, though, students are encouraged to enroll in as many research seminars as possible. The topics for these center on topics chosen by the faculty from year to year, reflecting both current research enthusiasms and perceptions of what the current group of students want and need. Thus our graduate students begin significant independent research and writing projects immediately upon their arrival at Berkeley. Guiding them in writing well and thinking independently about research are two values that distinguish Berkeley’s approach to musicological education at the graduate level. The program is structured at every stage to support and foster individual approaches to musicological work. The M.A. exam is individually designed, beginning from a list of eight topics spanning different historical periods, musical genres, and methodological approaches chosen by the student. The qualifying exam, taken just before a student embarks on writing the dissertation, is intended to establish a strong base for dissertation research and teaching in one’s area of specialization, and focuses on three broad topics relevant to the dissertation. Lively conversation marks the Berkeley musicology program at all stages, from seminar discussions to question periods after talks by visiting speakers to one-on-one mentoring on the dissertation and professional activities.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedEach of the graduate programs — composition, ethnomusicology, and history and literature — has a set of requirements that are tailored for the particular specialization. Please see the specific sections in the Graduate Student Handbook for details.Enrollment in a minimum of 12 units per semester is required to remain eligible for a fellowship.Doctoral students must satisfy a foreign language requirement of reading knowledge of two languages.Proficiency in a language is usually demonstrated by a written examination consisting of a passage (or passages) totaling a minimum of 300 words, at least partly taken from the literature on music. Proficiency in the second language may be established either by examination or by four semesters of coursework with a grade of B or better. For students who enter at the M.A. level, one language must be completed before the M.A. exam. Students entering at the Ph.D. level must complete both language requirements prior to completion of the Qualifying Exam.The department employs graduate students after their first year of study to be graduate student instructors in a variety of courses in European music history, American music cultures, ear training, harmony, computer music, chorus, and orchestra. Teaching experience and training of this kind are philosophical and practical aims of the program, and a primary means of student support.The purpose of the Qualifying Examination is to determine that the student is an expert in those areas that have been specified for the examination, and can in all likelihood design and produce an acceptable dissertation.The Ph.D. Qualifying Exam Committee consists of four faculty members: three from the Department of Music and one outside member who must be a member of the Academic Senate. One of the members of the committee functions as chair. The chair of the committee must be a member of the Academic Senate and cannot be the same as the chair of the student’s dissertation committee.Each doctoral candidate must be responsible for and prepare a dissertation representing his or her own contribution to original scholarship or creative work. The student’s project must be approved and guided by a Dissertation Committee comprising three members of the faculty, including the Dissertation Chair and two additional pertinent specialists, one of whom must be from a department other than Music.© 2017 UC Regents.

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Department of Music offers a roster of courses every summer, including Music 20A: Basic Musicianship, N26AC: Music in American Cultures, Music 128R (History of Jazz in America), a variety of introductory instrumental classes, and many others. You do not have to be a U.C. Berkeley student to enroll in these courses. Students interested in completing a Music Minor may choose to fulfill some or all of their minor requirements during Summer Sessions.See the Online Schedule of Classes for a complete and most up-to-date course offerings.See Summer Sessions regarding application, enrollment, and other student services matters. © 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Department of Music grants a B.A. degree in music and also a minor in music. We are dedicated to a liberal education in the arts and humanities, and thus involve students in all aspects of the study of music-theoretical and creative studies, historical and cultural studies, music and technology, and performance. Our curriculum is responsive to the interests of a diverse student body, and we pride ourselves on offering a broad and flexible program.The major may serve as pre-professional training for the student seeking a career in music or provide a lasting source of enrichment for the student with other career goals. Prospective majors are asked to demonstrate a minimum standard of musical literacy in a placement test. Since we are a Department of Music rather than a School of Music, a performance audition is not required to declare the major. Lower-division studies are intended to provide grounding in the skills of musicianship and harmony and a broad background in the literature and practices of European and a variety of other music. Upper division students may choose from an extensive selection of elective courses to create an individual course of study according to their own interests. The department offers an honors program in which a major in the senior year may develop a special honors project working with a faculty adviser in any area of music studies.There are a large number of double majors in the department representing fields such as Molecular and Cell Biology, Rhetoric, Physics, Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, Political Economy of Industrial Societies, English, and Business Administration, to just name a few.© 2017 UC Regents.

A Department of Music is likely to be a smaller academic unit, situated within a liberal arts educational environment. A School of Music is essentially a conservatory (i.e.., focused on training professional performers) that is situated within a University A Department of Music such as ours, for example, offers a Bachelor of Arts degree while a School of Music may offer both a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Music degree.What is the relationship between admissions to the University and declaration of the major?
The Undergraduate Admissions Office handles admission to the College of Letters and Science. For information, see admissions information.
Students can declare the major when they have enrolled in 49B and 49C. In order to enroll in these courses, the student must have taken the Placement Exam and placed into 49B.What is the balance between theoretical knowledge and experiential knowledge in the Department of Music’s program?There are many opportunities to apply both. Connections are constantly made between the theory of music and our experiences of it in sound either as a listener or practitioner. Musicianship training (learning to hear and notate, to sing from notation at sight, to listen analytically) comes into use in harmony courses, in history and culture courses, and in performance study. Study of harmony involves musical creativity as well as analysis, often of repertoire that is being performed in our context. Theory, listening skills, analytical skills are important no matter what musical repertoires are being studied.What are some extracurricular music opportunities at the university?The Undergraduate Composers organize concerts each semester in which Cal students perform pieces by students.
Free noon concerts take place in Hertz Hall every Wednesday. Performers must be affiliated with UC Berkeley, and audition during the semester preceding their proposed concert. Student recitals are also presented in 125 Morrison Hall.
There are many DeCal classes that have to do with music. In order to supplement your classical and theory knowledge, it is a good idea to check out the DeCal classes for hip-hop, funk, or spoken poetry that are usually offered. The list of classes changes, but make sure to take a look at the classes every semester. Their website is: http://www.decal.org/. When and how can I declare the major?See Major Declaration.Can I declare a concentration in composition, ethnomusicology, musicology, or performance?
The only “declaration” process is the declaration of the music major.. All music majors receive a B.A. in Music. If they wish, students may design a concentration or specialization based on individual interests, but this is an informal process. Upper division courses in each of the fields listed above are offered every semester. Consult undergraduate careers for planning suggestions, or meet with a faculty member to discuss options. Students are encouraged to select a faculty mentor who will help guide them along the chosen path. This is particularly important for students who are interested in pursuing graduate studies or considering a career in music.How big are the major classes in the Department of Music?
Music major courses in musicianship and theory are restricted to fewer than twenty students. Upper division major seminars are smaller. History and culture courses range from 30 to 100 students. Enrollment in performance ensembles is appropriate to the repertoire that be performed and its instrumentation. Our teachers know the students and vice versa. We are a relatively intimate department within the large university.Is it possible to double major, and still graduate in four years?
Yes, many music majors successfully complete a second major in four years. It often takes careful planning, because the music major has many lower division requirements. Be sure to check in with the Undergraduate Advisor in the Music Department and in L&S as you choose your courses each semester.What are the degree requirements and policies of the major and the university?
The music department is part of the College of Letters and Science and awards Bachelor’s of Arts degrees (B.A.’s) to undergraduate students. There are four sets of requirements: those required by all campuses of the University of California, those required specifically at UC Berkeley, those of the College of Letters and Science, and those of the music department. To earn your degree, you must successfully complete the music major requirements as well as the the university, Berkeley campus, and College of Letters & Science requirements. For the first of three sets of requirements, please consult: http://ls.berkeley.edu/?q=undergraduate/degree-requirements-policies.Do you need piano skills to be a music major? If not, what options are there for you to learn how to play the piano?
You do not necessarily need prior piano experience, although having some will make the work a lot easier for you. There is a piano class, Music 405, that gives music majors the opportunity to learn basic piano technique in a group lesson setting. This class is highly recommended for those with little or no piano experience.If I want to take private lessons as music major, how do I do that?
Private instruction is provided for the most skilled musicians among our majors under the course number Music 150. Music 150 is a personalized performance program for the intermediate to advanced performer. Each student works individually with a private instructor while participating in one of the performance ensembles listed above. To enroll, students must be declared music majors.How can majors participate in the governance of the Department of Music?
There is an opportunity as an undergraduates to serve as the Undergraduate Representative on the Undergraduate Committee. This committee holds monthly meetings to discuss issues that directly affect the undergraduate music program. It is made up of a few student representatives as well as staff and faculty members. This is a good place to let your voice be heard and to discuss the opportunities available to undergraduate music students. What is the process to waive Music 20A/B? See “Exemption from lower division requirements” under the Music Minor Program.Should I pre-enroll in Music 20A before scheduling the waiver exam?Music 20A classes are usually enrolled in capacity with a substantial waitlist. Students should pre-enroll in the class even if they attempt to waive the requirement.Will I be able to waive Music 20A/B?Students should review the Music 20A sample syllabus to see if they have already mastered the content covered in the course, thereby assessing their ability to obtain the waiver.Are performance courses in the 140 series repeatable? Can I repeat one for the minor requirement?Performance courses (Music 140-149, 164, 165) are repeatable without restrictions, meaning that you can repeat it as many times as you with. Students can, and should, review the repeat rule of each course in the Berkeley Academic Guide.Students may count a repeatable course toward the minor a maximum of 3 times, regardless of how many times they repeat the course. What performance opportunities are available in the Department of Music?
The Department offers ensemble courses (the Music 140 series) that are available to all students on the campus, both majors and non-majors alike. Music majors can perform individually or as part of larger ensembles for course credit. All majors must complete three semesters of performance ensemble requirement, but are encouraged to do more. For-credit ensembles are African Music Ensemble, Contemporary Improvisation Ensemble, Gospel Choir, Javanese Gamelan, University Baroque Ensemble, University Chorus, University Symphony, and University Wind Ensemble. Other major courses that involve performance are Jazz Theory and Performance (116AM/BM), Conducting (161A/B), Improvisation (164), Baroque Music Performance (171D), composer or genre studies that include performance of the music (180 series), and world music courses that include 11 weeks of performance lab (131-9).I’m interested in joining an ensemble or enrolling in a performance course. Do I have to audition?Enrollment in the Music 140 series and 150 are audition-based. See Audition Information for more information. Information on the upcoming auditions is usually updated on the webpage in early August for Fall semesters and early January for Spring semesters.With the exception of Music 148, students may choose to pre-enroll in a class in the Music 140 series before auditioning, or add the class after they pass the audition. In either scenario, students are responsible for adjusting their enrollment accordingly by the student enrollment deadlines. It is imperative that students observe these deadlines as they are strictly enforced. Students interested in taking Music 148 are advised to pre-enroll in the course. What does the Musicianship Placement Exam require?
The written and practical exam determines the courses that will be the best fit for you in your first semester. You will display your background in music theory, musicianship and performance, and piano. See Placement Procedures.I will be taking the Musicianship Placement Exam for the first time this upcoming semester. What classes should I sign up for during my enrollment appointment?You should pre-enroll in Music 52A (Musicianship I) and Music 53A (Harmony I) prior to taking the exam. If you read the musicianship placement criteria and harmony placement criteria and are reasonably confident that you may place above either, pre-enroll in the course that you believe you would place in. You will be able to adjust you enrollment when placement results become available.Note that you are responsible for making changes to your class schedule and adhering to the student enrollment deadlines. Never assume that you would be automatically added to or dropped from a class.Can I repeat the Musicianship Placement Exam?Yes, the Musicianship Placement Exam is a diagnostic test and students can repeat it in the following semester. However, if you do not place into a desired level of after two attempts, please consult the Undergraduate Advisor and a musicianship faculty regarding the best course of action to pursue your educational goals. I’m interested in taking this undergraduate Music course but it’s not listed in the Class Schedule. Will it be offered?Not all courses are offered in a given semester. If a class is not listed in the Class Schedule for a given semester, it is not offered in that semester. © 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedStudents with a 3.5 GPA in the major and 3.3 GPA overall may apply for admission to the Honors Program.The award of departmental Honors is contingent upon submission of a thesis or project of high quality, based upon independent study with a member of the Music Department’s faculty and marked by satisfactory completion of Music H195. The faculty sponsor will evaluate whether the project is of Honors quality. Departmental Honors designations will be included in the student’s permanent UC Berkeley record. The Music Department maintains a file of select completed Honors theses, which are available for review. CoursesStudents are required to enroll in Music H195 (4 units) in the semester in which they complete the thesis. In case of a year-long project as agreed upon in the application proposal, honors candidates may repeat the course once. Music H195 may be used to count toward the 24 upper-division units required for the major once; if repeated, only one Music H195 class may count toward upper division electives.Upon conclusion of the project, students are required to submit the work to their faculty sponsor for evaluation, and furnish a copy to the Music Department for archive. Submit the archive copy to 104 Morrison no later than 1 week after final grades are released. Suggested TimelineJunior Year (Spring):

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedPreparation for transfer students should include work in:Placement in the musicianship series (49B, 50, 51) and the harmony series (49C, 60, 61) at Berkeley is determined by the department placement exam, not by previous coursework.The description of the placement exams and the criteria for placement can function as a guide for students in their preparation. It is important that transfer students be able to place into 49B during their first semester. Those who do not will need to take 20A before beginning the major sequence of classes for musicianship and harmony, which may prolong their completion of degree requirements.Students who are able to come to the Berkeley campus may take the department’s placement exam on an advisory basis at the beginning of any semester.Music Placement Procedure: All entering transfer students intending to major in music must be prepared to take the first four parts of the department’s placement procedure on the day before instruction begins. Students with little or no keyboard experience should also take the Piano 405 placement exam, which usually takes place during the first week of term.These exams determine the student’s placement in or exemption from the lower division musicianship and harmony series and also serve as an audition for the department’s performance classes.All new transfer students must schedule an appointment with Zoe Xu online during the first month of classes to plan a strategy for completing the major.Students should bring with them:Until they know the results of the placement exam, students should register for:Students will be able to make adjustments to their course schedule during the add/drop period to reflect the placement exam.In addition students may sign up for the following kinds of courses:© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedAll students intending to major in music must follow the Music placement procedure before beginning music major classes. This procedure places students in the musicianship and harmony sequences, and determines whether supplemental classes in piano are recommended.Note that the Musicianship Placement Exam is administered once before the beginning of each semester; it is mandatory for prospective music majors and students should plan their school break accordingly in order to attend. To declare the Music Major, prospective students must:During Fall 2017 – Spring 2018, students who are wait-listed for Music 70 or 80 may choose the following course substitutes to fulfill major declaration requirements:Students must obtain permission from the Undergraduate Advisor prior to choosing this substitution. Student must obtain a C or higher in both the substitute course(s) ANDMusic 70 as well as 80 to remain in good standing with the major.An Undergraduate Orientation is held once before the beginning of each semester. The orientation reviews important information such as placement exams, major requirements, program planning, major resources, and student life. It is imperative that prospective music majors make every possible effort to attend.Major Declaration Timeline:The minimum amount of time required to complete all declaration requirements is one semester. Because intended music majors must receive a grade of C or higher in each required course, they will officially declared in the major in the months following the end of the semester, after final grades are released.It is expected that most students will be able to complete all declaration requirements within a year, and transfer students should strive to complete the requirements in one semester. Students should seek consultation with the Undergraduate Advisor as soon as possible if this is not feasible for their individual circumstances.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibited© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedAll courses counting towards Music Major lower and upper division requirements must be taken for a letter grade. A letter grade of C- or higher must be received in all of your lower and upper division Music Major courses. Additionally, students must maintain a 2.0 GPA in the major to be in good standing. The first semester of the major is an integrated introductory course that combines musicianship (49B) and harmony (49C). It is recommended that students with limited keyboard skills take Music 405 as well. Students are required to make an appointment with a Music Department Advisior at the beginning of their first semester to plan their program for future semesters. Students will go on to develop their basic skills with two additional semesters of both musicianship (50, 51) and harmony (60, 61). At the same time, they will broaden their knowledge of past and present musical cultures with four courses from the 73-77 series. All majors must take Music 76 (Western music history 1700-1900). In addition they must choose one or two courses from the Music 73-74 series (Music of Africa, Caribbean, Japan, Middle East, etc), and one or two from Music 75 (Western music history 900-1700) and 77 (Western music history 1900 to the present).Students without keyboard proficiency are strongly urged to enroll in two semesters of basic piano (Music 405) in their first semesters in the major program.All students must complete one course from the 170-180 series (seminars in analysis and performance), which offer more focused study of a composer or musical genre of Western or non-Western music, taught from a variety of perspectives.In addition students are required to take three semesters of performance from the 140 (2 units) or 150 (2-3 units) series, provided that they are in an ensemble in conjunction with their 150 lessons. Although these courses are upper division, they may be taken at any point in the student’s career. The 140 series consists of the department’s large performance ensembles and is open both to majors and non-majors. The 150 series is for music majors (by audition) who would like to receive subsidized lessons and coaching and also participate in smaller chamber ensembles. See Performance Program for Music Majors for more information.Most significant to the completion of the music major’s course of study are the remaining elective units necessary to reach a total of at least 24 upper division units in the major. These courses are to be chosen from those numbered 130-189 or from those courses numbered 100-129 with an “M” designation. Students are expected to shape their program according to their particular interests, using these units and, if they wish, additional courses from both within and outside the department (with departmental approval). Suggested areas of specialization include composition, musics of the world, western music history, conducting, performance , improvisation, theory and analysis, cognitive science and music technology. At least once every semester students need to meet with their advisers to discuss their program, obtain their advisor codes and have their elective courses approved.The College of Letters and Science requires that all music majors complete 36 upper division units. In addition to the 24 units required for the music major (see above), students must complete 6 units that are outside of the major, and 6 units that are either in or out of the major.For those thinking of graduate school or a career in music the department has outlined a number of programs of study at the careers page.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedStudents may choose to complete a minor in Music, which consists of a total of 8 courses (3 lower-division and 5 upper-division courses). The lower division courses for the music minor are:Courses for the music major may be substituted for the equivalent minor course (on left) if student has placed 49B or higher on the Music Placement Procedure.*Under rare circumstances, Music 70 and 80 may be used as substitution with instructor approval. However, both courses are requirements for the Music Major; enrollment in these two courses are highly competitive and prioritize declared/intended Music Majors. Prerequisites of Music 70: students must have taken and passed the Musicianship Placement Exam; be fluent in reading music notation; or have consent of instructor. Prerequisite of Music 80: for music majors and intended music majors only.The Music Placement Exam is given in 125 Morrison at 9 am the day before instruction begins during the Fall and Spring semesters. Come prepared with a piece to play or sing, and a pencil with an eraser. For more information, see the Music Placement Procedure page.All courses for the minor must be taken for a letter grade. A letter grade of C- or higher must be received in all of your lower and upper division music minor courses. A minimum of 5 upper division music courses (100-149).Upper division courses designed primarily for music majors (151-189) may be substituted if the student has met the prerequisites or has the permission of the instructor. We do not accept course substitution by AP Music Theory or coursework from community college. However, Music 20A and B may be waived by examination. The Music 20A/B Minor Waiver Exam is a 15-minute oral test. It is appropriate for intending minors who:The sample syllabus for Music 20A is available at Course Information. Students with questions about their ability to obtain the waiver should review the syllabus and see if they have already mastered the content covered in the course.Students may not waive Music 25A. Those with training in four-part harmony writing who would like to place out of 25A should take the Advanced Placement Harmony Exam. If placed out of 25A or 53A, students should take the next level of harmony course.To request Music 20A/B waiver, please contact Prof. Matthew Hough at hough@berkeley.edu. Unlike a major, there is no formal “declaration” of intent to minor in Music. Students can, and should, start taking required Music courses prior to declaration.Students declare the Music Minor by completing a Completion of L&S Minor Form, as well as a Major/Minor Overlap Check Form, once they are enrolled in the final course(s) to complete the Music Minor. Be sure to obtain respective major advisor’s signature (unless waived–see below), and submit to the Department of Music main office in 104 Morrison (no appointment necessary).Students must declare the Music Minor by the semester before they plan to graduate. If students plan to complete the final course(s) for the Music Minor in their last semester, they are required to submit the above-mentioned forms as soon as they enroll in the required Music courses, but no later than the last day of instruction in the preceding semester. For example, if you intend to graduate in Fall 2017 and need one Music elective for the minor, you must submit the completed and signed forms, and list the said elective as “enrolled,” as soon as you are enrolled in the course in October or November 2017.Students in the following L&S majors do not need to complete the “L&S Major” portion of the Major/Minor Overlap Check Form or obtain their major advisor’s signature:Declaration of the minor is confirmed when “Music UG” appears under Minors on student’s CalCentral profile. Completion of the minor will be reviewed and approved when all the listed courses receive a final grade. If certified, the completion of the minor will be noted in the “memorandum” section on your transcript. It will not appear on your diploma.© 2017 UC Regents.

Although originally cast in 1915 by the John Taylor Bell foundry of Loughborough, England, the bells were not installed in Sather Tower until 1917 due to delays caused by World War I. The bells were first played for three hours on November 3, 1917, joined by all the bells and whistles of Berkeley.“The bells of Berkeley are so strongly integrated into the daily life of the campus community that they are the aural icons of Berkeley,” noted University Carillonist Jeff Davis.To celebrate the 100-year mark of the carillon, Davis will be inviting a variety of carillonists and composers to collaborate on performances throughout the year. The festivities will culminate in the summer with the 2018 UC Berkeley Carillon Festival. These activities will also seek to raise awareness and funds for much needed repairs to the instrument.Although the UC Berkeley Carillon enjoys fame well beyond the Bay Area, long overdue maintenance threatens to silence the bells.  Crucial improvements were made in 1983, but significant repairs are still needed. For example, the transmission mechanism on any carillon generally needs to be redone every twenty years, a length of time that we have long-since surpassed.  At Berkeley, routine upkeep is exacerbated by the location of the instrument directly across from the Golden Gate, a location that, while beautiful, is extraordinarily rough on the instrument.  The result is that rust and other mechanical problems caused by the uninterrupted action of salt air and wind, have made the instrument increasingly difficult to play.We appeal to everyone in the Berkeley community, past and present, to help renovate and rejuvenate this true treasure of our shared life.The UC Berkeley Carillon has enjoyed incremental progress over the decades. The original twelve bell chime did not have enough notes to play pieces such as the National Anthem. So in 1978, the Class of 1928, as a fiftieth anniversary gift to the University, decided to raise funds to add a few bells so more tunes could be played. The improvements to the instrument sparked interest throughout the world, and in 1983, thanks to a generation donation by Jerry and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers, the carillon expanded to 61 bells.In the decades since, Berkeley’s carillon has only grown in international stature.  The acquisitions of the carillon library include rare recordings, manuscripts and books.

We have an exciting schedule planned for this semester. Join us as we celebrate the 65th year of the free Noon Concert Series in Hertz Hall, a Music Department project that has brought high-quality live music performances to hundreds of thousands of appreciative listeners from across the campus, the community and the larger Bay Area.  This fall, our Department of Music will offer a splendid array of musical styles ranging from Orchestra and Choirs, to Jazz, and Gamelan, to the newest composition creations.  We do it all, and we continue to thrive in the midst of tough financial times, thanks to the wonderful generosity of our many supporters.  A quick look at the programming reveals the incredible University Symphony, just returned from a tour of Spain under conductor David Milnes, the choral programs with Nikolas Nackley and Magen Solomon directing, the Gospel Choir led by Dr. Mark Wilson, and Gamelan with famed Javanese Gamelan master Midiyanto.  It is all excellent music, with over 25 concerts this semester! Get to your seats early for the large ensemble concerts as these events will fill the hall. At the core of everything we do is the dedication of our Hertz Hall staff and the hundreds of talented and devoted musicians who give their lives to the rich traditions of music making.  Nothing is really free, but together with the support and encouragement of our esteemed audiences, we make it happen.  Our key message will always be that live music, small and large, and from every point on the globe, indicates good social health and contributes to a richer and more peaceful community.  Help us if you can with any level of donation.  Or feel free to reach out to the Chair for more information and conversation.Delia Casadei, a musicologist specializing in 20th-century Italy has joined The UC Berkeley Department of Music as an Assistant Professor. A native of Italy, Casadei completed her undergraduate and Master’s degree at King’s College London. She earned her Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania, where she was awarded a Hopkinson Graduate Research Fellowship, a Mellon Humanities Fellowship, and Alvin H. Johnson AMS 50 Dissertation Completion Fellowship. Casadei spent the last year at Jesus College in Cambridge where she completed a Junior Research Fellowship.“I am honored to join the music department at Berkeley, a place I have long admired from afar” said Casadei. “Since arriving a couple of months ago I have had many exciting conversations with historians, ethnomusicologists, performers and composers, and most importantly students. This is a strange and sometimes frightening time to be in the U.S. and I feel privileged to share the campus with people who are passionate and ask difficult questions about the world that surrounds them.” Casadei’s research focuses on the politics of the voice’s relationship to language, particularly in the Italian twentieth century. Her thesis examined this relationship by way of Milan in the 1950s-70s, and she is currently researching her first book, which will examine key political theories formulated in Italy between the 1950s and today and the manner in which these approaches are tied to the use of recording technology. Aside from her research on 20th century Italian musicology, Casadei also studies the historical relationship of music and laughter in the twentieth century.On Friday, November 3 the carillon bells located in Sather Tower (the Campanile) will mark their 100th anniversary.

How were the conservatories different from your experience in Berkeley?All those places are incredibly different from each other. In Lima I acquired a solid base, especially in regards to harmony, counterpoint, and music theory in general. All of this especially thanks to my mentor and -as I like to call him- my “personal Yoda”, Enrique Iturriaga, a 99-year-old composer who has made an indelible mark in Peruvian musical life. The Sibelius Academy reinforced that base but it provided me with great exposure to Finland’s (and by extension, Europe’s) rich contemporary music scene. It also gave me plenty of opportunities to explore my fascination for the symphony orchestra, not only because Finland, a country of 5.5 million, boasts 25 professional orchestras, but also because the Sibelius Academy itself has a very strong orchestral conducting department, a fact that allowed me to try a few of my compositions in rehearsal. What I took from Berkeley was creative freedom. Europe has strong traditions and it is hard for Europeans to let go of them sometimes. California, in turn, is fertile ground for innovation in many areas, the kind of innovation and openness that allowed the birth of Minimalism, for example. It is here, at Berkeley, where I was able to distill my language and find my personal voice.Edmund Campion was your advisor at Cal. What was the most significant thing you took away from him?Ed believed, and still believes, in me and my music. He had real faith in that, as competitive as it is, I could make it in the music industry. He guided me through my transition from the world of academia to the hard realities of being a freelance composer. He recognized my strength,s and weaknesses and helped me carve the path that I have carved for myself. Ed recognized my talent and had faith in me right from the start. I will be always grateful to him for that.You’re debuting a concerto at the end of the month titled “Guardian of the Horizon.” Can you tell us about it?The Sphinx Organization, which has done a fantastic job supporting black and Latino musicians, is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and they commissioned me to create the Concerto Grosso for Violin, Cello & Strings to celebrate the occasion. They are taking the piece on tour throughout several cities in the US, including their annual Gala Concert at Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium on October 13th. The work has been co-commissioned by the Sphinx Organization, with the support of Linda and Stuart Nelson, Carnegie Hall, and New World Symphony, and it is dedicated to my father’s memory, who passed away in December of last year. This work is also a part of Carnegie Hall’s “125 commissions” project, celebrating the famed institution’s 125th anniversary.You’ll be composer-in-residence at the Houston Symphony for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. What are your goals/aspirations for your time in Texas?During these two upcoming seasons I will be focusing on three major projects: a violin concerto, a symphony, and a mentorship program with young composers that will culminate on a concert consisting of new works by student composers from the Houston area. The violin concerto’s premiere has, sadly, had to be postponed in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but it will certainly take place during the 2018-19 season. The symphony will be premiered during the 2018-19 season and it will pay homage to Houston’s special contribution to space exploration. The mentorship program will be developed in conjunction with Professors from Rice University and University of Houston, and it will consist in the creation of new works, workshops with Houston Symphony musicians, interdisciplinary cooperation, and a final presentation at a special venue where the newly created works will be presented. In addition to all this, I will participate in talks, lectures, and chamber music concerts, plus other existing works of mine will be featured during the orchestra’s upcoming seasons.In the Denver Post, Ray Mark Rinaldi says “Lopez doesn’t sound like the other composers currently at work. His influences are broad, but he has a distinct voice and it is adventurous and winning. He’s making opera that sounds like him, rather than trying to emulate others.” How did you find your voice in terms of composition?During my time in Lima my eyes and ears were pointed toward Europe, so I didn’t pay much attention to my own country’s rich musical tradition. All of this changed when I moved to Finland because there I realized that in order to develop a distinct voice I could not continue ignoring my geographical origins. After coming to the US I continued to explore the Avant-garde scene, especially in Germany (Darmstadt and Donaueschingen), as I continued to delve into my geographical roots with works such as “Perú Negro”, which is entirely inspired by Afro-Peruvian music. These two parallel roads were not at odds with each other, but they were not necessarily interacting with each other, so in my mid thirties I made a conscious (and sometimes also unconscious) effort to integrate them into a single mode of expression. Nowadays I feel perfectly comfortable employing the tools I have learned from both of them and the result is a more unified and distinct personal voice that I think will continue to be shaped as I enter my forties. UC Berkeley Department of Music Professor Emeritus Richard Taruskin has been awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize. A notable honor, the Kyoto Prize has long been regarded by many as the most significant award available in fields that are traditionally not honored with a Nobel Prize.Bestowed annually since 1985 by the Inamori Foundation, the Prize is presented in three categories: Advanced Technology, Basic Sciences, and Arts and Philosophy. Taruskin joins prominent scholars to win the award including Noam Chamsky, Jane Goodall, Witold Lutosławski, and fellow UC Berkeley faculty member Richard Karp. The Kyoto Prize also comes with a 50 million Yen prize that will be awarded at the official ceremonies in Kyoto, Japan in November.“It’s obvious that he is the most important music historian of his generation in this country – perhaps in the world,” said Princeton University musicologist Simon Morrison of Taruskin.A world-renowned musicologist, music historian, and critic Taruskin came to UC Berkeley Music in 1986. Previously he served numerous roles at Columbia University where he earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. While at Columbia he worked as choral conductor and played viola da gamba with the well-known Aulos Ensemble.While at UC Berkeley he published widely including his widely-lauded six volume “Oxford History of Western Music” which examines the whole of the European musical history. He retired from the UC Berkeley Department of Music in 2014.Read more:

Throughout the year, Hertz Hall has been bursting with students as we absorbed the overflow from a closed Wheeler Auditorium under renovation. We look forward to a quieter fall season.  Our student orchestra has been incredibly busy this year with an active schedule of traditional and new works e in preparation for going on tour to Spain at the end of May.  On the faculty side of things, I’m happy to announce two new endowed chair appointments: Professor James Davies will hold the Henry and Julia Weisman Schutt Chair, and Professor Ken Ueno will hold the Jerry and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers Chair.  In the fall, we will be welcoming Delia Casadei, a musicologist, and in the fall of 2018 Maria Sonevytsky, an ethnomusicologist will be joining the faculty.

We will greatly miss Professor Davitt Moroney, who retired in December, 2016.Professor Moroney is a renowned harpsichordist and scholar, specializing in French and English 17th-18th century music as well as the music of J.S. Bach.  He was also appointed as the University Organist, and led the effort to replace our older concert organ with the beautiful Noack Baroque organ installed behind the stage in Hertz Hall.  He received numerous awards for his performances and recorded hundreds of works. One of the most memorable occasions for me was his series for Cal Performances where he performed the entire cycle of the Well-Tempered Clavier of Bach, and you could see patrons throughout the audience showing up with their scores to follow along with the music.  Perhaps most famously, in 2007 Professor Moroney discovered a long lost mass by Alessandro Striggio, an enormous choral work written for 40 and 60 parts, and conducted the first performance of it since the 16th century.  In his retirement, he will be returning to Paris although we hope that he will continue to visit and perform here in Berkeley!

I would also like to recognize that our intrepid sound engineer Jay Cloidt, who has been with us since 2009, will be retiring as of this June.  It will be very challenging to replace Jay, as he has always gone above and beyond the call for us.  

We had a lovely commencement ceremony for the Music Department on May 14, and you can see the results in the “Class of 2017: By the Numbers” article here. I know that I speak for the entire faculty when I say that we are genuinely proud of all of our students and their accomplishments.  It is rewarding to watch students mature into performers, scholars, and composers over the course of their studies with us.  We all gain from the music they make, the exchange of ideas, and the fresh perspectives they bring.  

The end of this spring marks my third year as Chair of the Music department.  Next year I will be on sabbatical, and I will pass the baton to the very capable hands of Professor Edmund Campion.  After my leave, I plan to return as Chair in the year-after-next.  Please do welcome Professor Campion when we return in the fall and expect to be hearing more from him!I was born in Bucharest, Romania. My family was, as one would say, “very creative”: my mom is a visual artist, my dad had studied classical violin for ten years, my grandmother was a classically trained soprano and my great-aunt was a piano teacher. My parents and godparents took me to classical concerts since I was five, and made sure the house was always resonating with the sounds of the good ol’ classics; but I was never really around a piano. When I was seven my godmother had the idea to have me audition for the local music school, and Carmen Simu, who ended up being my first teacher, discovered what she thought was a particularly excellent ear — although she had no room for additional piano students in her studio at that time, so she suggested I check out the next-door violin studio. For whatever reason, I absolutely resisted taking that offer and demanded I still learn piano; and so it began. Driven above all, perhaps, by an ardent love of Beethoven (to whom I sent love letters in the form of paper airplanes when I was eight), I realized within the next year that I wanted to be a professional pianist. My fourth year I started more intensive studies with professor Carmen Enescu, who also taught at the Dinu Lipatti National College of Art, and in fifth grade, my parents and I moved to the United States where I began studies with Hans Boepple at Santa Clara University. By that time, I was sure that my future would center around the conservatory path; throughout middle school and high school, I worked strenuously to prepare for this and performed pieces like Chopin’s First Concerto and Prokofiev’s Second Concerto with orchestras, receiving several awards in national and international piano competitions in the process.Theodora Serbanescu Martin ’17After applying to many schools and finishing my undergraduate auditions, I had a curious experience as I weighed my options: most of the programs I’d gotten accepted into were conservatories, and just a couple were universities that I considered not necessarily back-ups — but certainly “alternatives.” Throughout middle school and high school, I also cultivated an interest in writing (anything from essays to music reviews for Peninsula Reviews), and a passion for English and Russian literature. Already by the beginning of senior year when I was looking at potential schools, I was thinking about pursuing a double major with English. In short, the reason I applied to Berkeley was because I knew the Department of English was ranked first in the country; I hadn’t really heard about the music program. But when I did receive my acceptance letter, I suddenly felt an unexpected, immovable feeling that I had to choose Berkeley; an inexplicable force drew me to the campus — which I had never even visited properly before except to hear a couple of concerts at Zellerbach. None of my family members, friends, or even I thought this would have ever been a serious choice, but for some reason, at the last minute, I felt imminent regret — that to choose a conservatory education would mean to give up my other varied intellectual interests; and I was not ready — I still had so much to learn, so much knowledge and culture to funnel into my mind and heart!

Berkeley gave me not only what I had somehow intuitively known it would, but something infinitely above what I would have ever hoped for. I’ll resist the urge to wax poetic about what a rich cultural experience even one day in Berkeley could be, but I can say that I’ve had, from the first moment on our campus, this feeling that I could only classify as “nostalgia for the present” — a heart-wrenching happiness, mixed with a determination that urged me to remind myself to enjoy every moment of it, because I would never feel this way again. (I mean, when else would I get to write poems at the Campanile at night and to smell that gentle mix of night jasmine and the drifting crispness of a San Francisco breeze?) Second semester of freshman year is when I really got involved in performance activities and started channeling my inner Hermione Granger in classes by doing “serious work” — beginning (of course) with the Beethoven course taught by the incomparable Nicholas Mathew, who encouraged me to explore the yet uncharted territory of my musical imagination, and to fulfill all my intellectual curiosities. Meeting the lovely historical keyboards in our department and learning to play them, expanding my already strong musical interests with classes such as James Davies’s Opera course and, as of lately, Prof. Roberts’s jointly taught course “Art & Activism,” becoming a part of the vivacious orchestra community as pianist in the UCBSO, sharing many beautiful lessons and musical moments with the ever-supportive, golden-hearted Martha Wasley, getting headaches from reading Adorno for my “Late Beethoven” graduate seminar, finding what I would classify as “musician soulmates” to play chamber music with, hearing free performances at Hertz and Zellerbach from ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic and talking to some of the members first-hand, add up to only a small percentage of the array of experiences that have made my time here in Berkeley unforgettable, and my educational self-development so comprehensive and thorough. 

Some of my highlights as music major include my performance of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto and my reading of Brahms’s Second Concerto with the UCBSO and the magnificent David Milnes, my four solo noon and evening concerts, the last of which I played on our Regier fortepiano, and the exciting process of designing and teaching for two semesters my DeCal on historically informed performance. Taking the last course the legendary Richard Taruskin ever taught will always be one of my fondest memories, as will my crazy independent study on Brahms with David Pereira, hearing James Davies’s pure and glittering laugh in the Morrison hallways, convincing myself to enjoy the many all-nighters I pulled to write gigantic over-the-page-limit papers for my history courses — and, of course, immersing myself in the over-the-top process of writing my honors thesis on Brahms, which included stuff like gawking at his manuscript in the Hargrove and trying to shield the fragile 155-year old paper from my acidic tears. For this project, I have received a 2017 Charlene Conrad Liebau Library Prize for Undergraduate Research and feel very thankful to all — professors, librarians, staff, family, friends — who have helped me through this process. Additionally, I am grateful to have been one of the recipients of the 2016 Eisner Prize in the Creative Arts — an honor for which I owe infinite thanks to everyone in the Department. 

Outside of music — and the Hargrove, which has become my second home, especially those ML.410.B8’s, which I had started to claim as my own (to the detriment of my constantly overdue library card) — my endeavors as English major and German minor gave me equally rich experiences that I do not have room to write about in here. All I can say is that sometimes I felt like three people in one, trying simultaneously to wrap my head around that un-translated version of Goethe and to finally understand the Genetiv, to get through the first book of Spenser’s Faerie Queene in one weekend because I had “procrastinated” on reading it by practicing Brahms for hours, and to scramble to write most of my overflowing English honors thesis on my man Sir Thomas Wyatt and his impossibly interesting, perplexing poetry in the last two months because I had a concert every month before and I “just didn’t have time.” 

Above all, it is the wonderful souls I’ve met in Berkeley who have made my experience what it was — the brilliant, caring professors, some of whom I know will be life-long connections, the patient roommates and best friends, the fellow Music and English majors who were always excellent at commiserating, and even that guy on Sproul who always shouts about global warming and how our education is actually brainwashing rather than enlightening us. And not to forget the squirrels, of course! 

It is difficult for me to accept that I have to leave this magical place soon, but at the same time I know that my experience at Berkeley — which has fostered my process of self-understanding — has already equipped me with more independence and self-sufficiency than I already possessed intrinsically. In the fall I will be heading off to Cornell University to continue my studies of music with a Musicology PhD. Currently my most important professional goal is to cultivate a career as performing scholar — to blend equally musicology and piano performance, and to advocate for interdisciplinary work of all sorts. More specifically, I hope to become a Brahms scholar — and yes, to keep performing tons of Beethoven and, well, any and all German Romantic piano music. Whatever I do, I am confident that everything I learned and experienced at Berkeley will give me the strength and knowledge to navigate all that the mysterious future will bring. Studying across disciplines and challenging conventions is something that has always been encouraged at UC Berkeley. Students’ coursework regularly spans across academia; but today’s world requires the ability to integrate knowledge and theory from multiple disciplines. Thanks to the launch of UC Berkeley’s Certificate in Design Innovation (BCDI), students will earn credit for taking courses focused on integration of methods, technologies, knowledge, and thought from a wide range of different disciplines. BCDI curriculum includes current courses, as well as newly developed classes with an emphasis on design innovation.A cornerstone of of the coursework for BCDI is Berkeley’s Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT). Founded by Professor Emeritus Richard Felciano in the late 1980s, CNMAT is known worldwide for audio research and linking the concert hall to the laboratory. Two new courses, Music 158A (Sound and Music Computing with CNMAT Technologies) and Music 158B (Situated Instrument Design for Musical Expression), were developed with grant support from the Digital Humanities at Berkeley. The new course development grants provided the opportunity for CNMAT to further integrate its 25-year legacy of research and digital tool development into the life of our Department of Music and greater University.“CNMAT and the Department of Music are excited to have their two new cornerstone courses in Music and Technology included in the BCDI,” said CNMAT Director and Music Professor Edmund Campion. “Music, design, and innovation go hand in hand, and it is very satisfying to find these new courses adopted for the BCDI.”Departments offering BCDI curriculum include Architecture, Art Practice, Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Design, Theatre, and Haas Business School. An added benefit of BCDI is students’ opportunity to take courses outside of their major, that they may not otherwise be able to be able to attend.-Alex CoughlinWhen David E. Fastovsky was a graduate student studying Paleontology at UC Berkeley in the 1970’s he was presented with the opportunity to play numerous rare instruments, including a prized Vuillaume viola in the Music Department’s rare instrument collection.“I told my current string quartet about the Vuillaume, and they were astounded – asking, ‘Did you know what it was?’ I definitely knew what it was.”Almost four decades later, he is adding to the Department’s collection of rare instruments by donating a rare Louis Lot flute and a wooden Buffet piccolo.The two instruments’ journey to Berkeley had many twists and turns. Louis Lot was a French flute maker who rose to prominence by pioneering new methods of flute manufacturing during the nineteenth century. By 1860, Lot became the official supplier of flutes to the Paris Conservatoire and gained further international notoriety. The flute (Serial number 6846) was manufactured around 1900. The Buffet piccolo was built roughly the same time by Buffet Crampon, a noted Parisian manufacturer of woodwinds.Fastovsky’s father Ashley was given the instruments as part of a Philharmonic scholarship while in high school in New York City playing with the All-City High School Orchestra in the late 1930’s. Ashley Fastovsky played it regularly again in the late 1970’s, during which time he had the flute restored. The Lot flute is not only notable because of its high-quality craftsmanship, but the purity of sound not found in modern instruments.The instruments join Music’s impressive collection which spans from rare Baroque-period woodwinds to thousands of choral pieces from various centuries. Of course, the Vuillaume Fastovsky played as a student still resides as part of the prized Salz collection of antique violins, violas and bows donated in 1964.“I cannot tell you how inspiring it was for my playing to be able to play on such an instrument,” said Fastovsky. “Perhaps somebody can love the Louis Lot the way I loved that Vuillaume.”Fastovsky serves as Chair of the Department of Geosciences at the University of Rhode Island. He is the co-author of “Dinosaurs: A Concise History” (Cambridge University Press).-Alex CoughlinZhoushu Ziporyn Noon Concert performance in September 2016Zhoushu Ziporyn was drawn to the UC Berkeley Department of Music for a number of reasons. The open and very friendly atmosphere, a holistic academic approach, an extensive library collection, and an amazing and open-minded faculty all drew Ziporyn to UC Berkeley.“I ended up in Cal because I like what it stands for. I was intrigued by the diversity of ensemble groups offered at the music program,” noted Ziporyn.Ziporyn started his musical career early, learning the violin as a child. He later found inspiration in the works of an eclectic collection of artists: Bach, The Beatles, Bill Evans, Prokofiev and Japanese traditional Gagaku music. As Ziporyn grew older he began playing in jazz and rock bands in his high school years and frequently jammed with his friends.Since coming to Cal, Ziporyn has amassed an impressive academic and musical record. He won the 2016 Alfred Hertz Memorial Traveling Scholarship, allowing him to visit Japan and study traditional Japanese instruments, as well as learning from the masters of the Nō Theatre tradition. He also was a winner of the Department’s Nicola de Lorenzo Prize for composition in 2015-16. This semester, he opened the 2016 Fall Noon Concert series with an original solo piece for electric violin titled “The Absurdity of Now and Then.”The University Baroque Ensemble performed a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuatre qui fait plisser les yeux” by Music major Zhoushu Ziporyn at Director Davitt Moroney’s final performance at Hertz Hall before his retirement.The University Baroque Ensemble performed a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuatre qui fait plisser les yeux” by Music major Zhoushu ZiporynZiporyn is also a gifted composer. He’s penned original works such as “Gimme Some Context,” “Sleep’s Tree,” and “If Only You Were Cool” while he served as an Emerging Artist with The Sheldon Brown Quartet at the Emerald Tablet in San Francisco. He also worked collaboratively as musical artist in “Cine/Spin,” creating the music for the feature film “Valerie and Her Week of Wonders” (Jaromil Jires, 1969) at UC Berkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA). Ziporyn also authored a collection of “Poetry Fugues for Seekers” in collaboration with UC Berkeley Astronomer Alexei Filippenko and Mycologist John Taylor.Most recently Ziporyn wrote a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuâtre qui fait plisser les yeux” which was premiered and performed by Director Davitt Moroney at the final University Baroque Ensemble concert before the Director’s retirement from UC Berkeley.With graduation on the horizon on spring 2017, Ziporyn plans on returning to Japan to spend a year furthering his studies with the masters in the traditional arts of Japan. As a culmination of his studies in Japan last June, he will be premiering a segment of his musical theatre, “Tomorrow’s Sound,” with the Theatre of Yūgen in San Francisco May 2017. He’s also working with a special group of musicians and actors to materialize “Star Wars Palimpsest: Luke as A Pagan Hero,” an original musical theatre work that pits the parallels between the cosmology of the Star Wars movies with the story of Abraham and Isaac in the Bible, as a kind of postmodern cantata that aims to provoke further flexibility of thought.“I honestly can’t believe that it’s already been four years. It has truly been a blast,” noted Ziporyn summing up his time at UC Berkeley. “As I face a future unknown to me about to unfold, one thing I do know is that I will always cherish my time at Cal and think back to it as a solid foundation to my future self and endeavors.”Nicholas MathewUC Berkeley Associate Professor of Music Nicholas Mathew’s schedule is pretty full most semesters. Between teaching a range of research and performance courses, maintaining a schedule of piano performances, and continuing to publish new research on late eighteenth-century music there is not much time for anything else in his professional calendar. But this year Mathew added more to his plate: a fellowship at UC Berkeley’s Townsend Center, helping to curate a series of concerts and lectures dedicated to the Mendelssohn family at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life, and designing a program of special events with the Takács Quartet, hosted by Cal Performances.“It’s been a busy year intellectually and musically,” said Mathew “but I’ve enjoyed the chance to engage the public in different ways.”Mathew has been researching across disciplines for some time, so a fellowship at the Townsend Center was a natural fit. Founded in 1987, the Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities encourages interdisciplinary scholarship, awarding fellowships annually to researchers whose academic interests traverse multiple disciplines. Mathew’s first book, Political Beethoven, was an interdisciplinary study that combined thickly textured material history and political theory alongside close music analysis. This year, his Townsend Fellowship will support a new project that focuses on music-making and commercial life in the expanding metropolitan centers of late eighteenth-century Europe, particularly with respect to the music of Beethoven’s most famous teacher, Joseph Haydn.When Cal Performances announced that the Takács Quartet would be performing the complete cycle of Beethoven quartets in Berkeley, they approached Mathew, along with the Takács’ first violinist Edward Dusinberre, to discuss how they might design new ways of engaging with these well-known works.  The first installment of this high-profile collaboration took place in October.“Ed and I already knew each other a little, because he had been completing a fantastic book about the Beethoven quartets and the compelling history of the Takács Quartet itself — so a stimulating collaboration was practically inevitable,” said Mathew.The Takács Quartet returns to Berkeley in March and April 2017, when Mathew will be joined by Mark Ferraguto (Penn State) and Mary Hunter (Bowdoin College) to talk — appropriately enough, in the Bay Area — about the “new media” of the early nineteenth century, and their consequences for Beethoven’s string quartets.So what will Mathew do to follow up his dizzying 2016-17?“Well, I’m on leave — and I hope to return waving a brand new book in the air. Fingers crossed.”Credit: Rick PeckhamAlexander Kahn graduated from UC Berkeley Music with his Ph.D. in 2008.

Students may pre-enroll (see below) in classes before the Music Placement Exam and make adjustments to their schedule during the add/drop period if necessary. An Undergraduate Orientation is held once before the beginning of each semester. The orientation reviews important information such as placement exams, major requirements, program planning, major resources, and student life. It is imperative that prospective music majors make every possible effort to attend.Spring 2018 Undergraduate Orientation: Friday, 01/12, 10-11am, location TBA. The Musicianship Placement Exam is required of all incoming music majors and students who wish to take music major classes. To register for the Musicianship Placement Exam complete the online registration form.The Musicianship Placement Exam is offered once per term only. No make-up exams will be offered.For more information on which course you may place in given your musical knowledge and experience, as well as how to prepare for the exam, see musicianship placement criteria.The exam comprises two parts; students must attend both the audition and the written portions to complete the exam.Written portion (theory and dictation):*Students may find the date and time of the written and dictation test by searching for Music 52A in the Berkeley Class Schedule. Enrollment in Music 52A does not present a schedule conflict for taking the Musicianship Placement Exam.Audition and sight singing portion:If you play an instrument (other than piano, organ, or harpsichord) that you are unable to bring to the Musicianship Placement Exam, you may be able to borrow one from the department. Please check in advance with Mark Mueller to be sure that the instrument you need is available to borrow.Note that this audition appointment pertains to the Musicianship Placement Exam only. If students intend to join a performance ensemble or another course that requires an audition, they must still audition for them separately (see audition information).  Required only for those incoming music majors or students who plan to take music major classes, who have previously studied four-part writing and can realize a figured bass or harmonize a melody. In other words, if you have sufficient background that you think you may place ahead in the harmony sequence, rather than at the beginning of the harmony sequence, this test is for you. This is an optional exam and can take up to 2 hours.The Harmony Advanced Placement Exam is offered the business day before the first day of classes. See the date and time in the online registration form; be sure to indicate your attendance in the form.See harmony placement criteria for more information.  If you are an intending music major and have little or no keyboard experience, you are strongly encouraged to take Piano 405 while you are completing your musicianship and harmony requirements. For admission to Piano 405, you must take the Musicianship Placement Exam and the Piano 405 Placement Exam. Priority for enrollment is given to Music Majors enrolled in Musicianship 52A, 52B, or 152A. A sign up sheet for the Music 405 Placement Exam will be posted on the bulletin board outside room 107 during the first week of classes. Be sure to sign up. Students wishing to pre-enroll in music major courses before completing the Placement Procedure should enroll in 52A and 53A unless they have had considerable formal training in musicianship and/or harmony. Those who have had formal training should look at the placement criteria for musicianship and harmony and estimate where they will place. Adjustments to your schedule can be made during the add/drop period during the semester.Students with little musical background should sign up for 20A before beginning the music major classes in musicianship and harmony. Once they have acquired more musical skills, they may take the Musicianship Placement Exam to see if they qualify for music major classes. See the criteria for placement in the musicianship series if you think this might apply to you. Students should plan to take Music 52A (Musicianship I) and 53A (Harmony I) concurrently. An exception can be made for qualified students who are unable to take both classes concurrently due to heavy course loads or schedule conflicts, in which case students should take Music 53A first unless instructed otherwise. However, the Musicianship Placement Exam is required even if students are only taking 53A.The Music Department only offers one section of 52A and 53A in spring semesters. Entry into these classes will be competitive based on Placement Exam results. The continuing sequence of those classes (Fall 52B-53B, Spring 152A-153A) will also have only one section each. Students should plan to take their musicianship and harmony classes without interruption to maximize their chances of securing a spot.© 2017 UC Regents.

Although originally cast in 1915 by the John Taylor Bell foundry of Loughborough, England, the bells were not installed in Sather Tower until 1917 due to delays caused by World War I. The bells were first played for three hours on November 3, 1917, joined by all the bells and whistles of Berkeley.“The bells of Berkeley are so strongly integrated into the daily life of the campus community that they are the aural icons of Berkeley,” noted University Carillonist Jeff Davis.To celebrate the 100-year mark of the carillon, Davis will be inviting a variety of carillonists and composers to collaborate on performances throughout the year. The festivities will culminate in the summer with the 2018 UC Berkeley Carillon Festival. These activities will also seek to raise awareness and funds for much needed repairs to the instrument.Although the UC Berkeley Carillon enjoys fame well beyond the Bay Area, long overdue maintenance threatens to silence the bells.  Crucial improvements were made in 1983, but significant repairs are still needed. For example, the transmission mechanism on any carillon generally needs to be redone every twenty years, a length of time that we have long-since surpassed.  At Berkeley, routine upkeep is exacerbated by the location of the instrument directly across from the Golden Gate, a location that, while beautiful, is extraordinarily rough on the instrument.  The result is that rust and other mechanical problems caused by the uninterrupted action of salt air and wind, have made the instrument increasingly difficult to play.We appeal to everyone in the Berkeley community, past and present, to help renovate and rejuvenate this true treasure of our shared life.The UC Berkeley Carillon has enjoyed incremental progress over the decades. The original twelve bell chime did not have enough notes to play pieces such as the National Anthem. So in 1978, the Class of 1928, as a fiftieth anniversary gift to the University, decided to raise funds to add a few bells so more tunes could be played. The improvements to the instrument sparked interest throughout the world, and in 1983, thanks to a generation donation by Jerry and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers, the carillon expanded to 61 bells.In the decades since, Berkeley’s carillon has only grown in international stature.  The acquisitions of the carillon library include rare recordings, manuscripts and books. The carillon instructional program has grown to the point where it is now one of the largest in the world.  The professional playing staff is one of the largest in North America, and the equal to any in the carillon centers of Europe.  The compositions and arrangements that have been created at Berkeley represent a great flowering of carillon music, and are played constantly on practically every carillon world-wide.The centennial of Sather Tower was celebrated on February 3, 2015 and featured a special installation and performance including a unique composition of bells (both recorded and live) and lighting modulated in real time by data from the UC Berkeley seismometer adjacent to the Hayward Fault. The composition performed on the carillon was written by Music Chair and faculty member Edmund Campion.Hello from Morrison Hall and the UC Berkeley Department of Music. We have an exciting schedule planned for this semester. Join us as we celebrate the 65th year of the free Noon Concert Series in Hertz Hall, a Music Department project that has brought high-quality live music performances to hundreds of thousands of appreciative listeners from across the campus, the community and the larger Bay Area.  This fall, our Department of Music will offer a splendid array of musical styles ranging from Orchestra and Choirs, to Jazz, and Gamelan, to the newest composition creations.  We do it all, and we continue to thrive in the midst of tough financial times, thanks to the wonderful generosity of our many supporters.  A quick look at the programming reveals the incredible University Symphony, just returned from a tour of Spain under conductor David Milnes, the choral programs with Nikolas Nackley and Magen Solomon directing, the Gospel Choir led by Dr. Mark Wilson, and Gamelan with famed Javanese Gamelan master Midiyanto.  It is all excellent music, with over 25 concerts this semester! Get to your seats early for the large ensemble concerts as these events will fill the hall. At the core of everything we do is the dedication of our Hertz Hall staff and the hundreds of talented and devoted musicians who give their lives to the rich traditions of music making.  Nothing is really free, but together with the support and encouragement of our esteemed audiences, we make it happen.  Our key message will always be that live music, small and large, and from every point on the globe, indicates good social health and contributes to a richer and more peaceful community.  Help us if you can with any level of donation.  Or feel free to reach out to the Chair for more information and conversation.Delia Casadei, a musicologist specializing in 20th-century Italy has joined The UC Berkeley Department of Music as an Assistant Professor. A native of Italy, Casadei completed her undergraduate and Master’s degree at King’s College London. She earned her Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania, where she was awarded a Hopkinson Graduate Research Fellowship, a Mellon Humanities Fellowship, and Alvin H. Johnson AMS 50 Dissertation Completion Fellowship. Casadei spent the last year at Jesus College in Cambridge where she completed a Junior Research Fellowship.“I am honored to join the music department at Berkeley, a place I have long admired from afar” said Casadei. “Since arriving a couple of months ago I have had many exciting conversations with historians, ethnomusicologists, performers and composers, and most importantly students. This is a strange and sometimes frightening time to be in the U.S. and I feel privileged to share the campus with people who are passionate and ask difficult questions about the world that surrounds them.” Casadei’s research focuses on the politics of the voice’s relationship to language, particularly in the Italian twentieth century. Her thesis examined this relationship by way of Milan in the 1950s-70s, and she is currently researching her first book, which will examine key political theories formulated in Italy between the 1950s and today and the manner in which these approaches are tied to the use of recording technology. Aside from her research on 20th century Italian musicology, Casadei also studies the historical relationship of music and laughter in the twentieth century.On Friday, November 3 the carillon bells located in Sather Tower (the Campanile) will mark their 100th anniversary.

How were the conservatories different from your experience in Berkeley?All those places are incredibly different from each other. In Lima I acquired a solid base, especially in regards to harmony, counterpoint, and music theory in general. All of this especially thanks to my mentor and -as I like to call him- my “personal Yoda”, Enrique Iturriaga, a 99-year-old composer who has made an indelible mark in Peruvian musical life. The Sibelius Academy reinforced that base but it provided me with great exposure to Finland’s (and by extension, Europe’s) rich contemporary music scene. It also gave me plenty of opportunities to explore my fascination for the symphony orchestra, not only because Finland, a country of 5.5 million, boasts 25 professional orchestras, but also because the Sibelius Academy itself has a very strong orchestral conducting department, a fact that allowed me to try a few of my compositions in rehearsal. What I took from Berkeley was creative freedom. Europe has strong traditions and it is hard for Europeans to let go of them sometimes. California, in turn, is fertile ground for innovation in many areas, the kind of innovation and openness that allowed the birth of Minimalism, for example. It is here, at Berkeley, where I was able to distill my language and find my personal voice.Edmund Campion was your advisor at Cal. What was the most significant thing you took away from him?Ed believed, and still believes, in me and my music. He had real faith in that, as competitive as it is, I could make it in the music industry. He guided me through my transition from the world of academia to the hard realities of being a freelance composer. He recognized my strength,s and weaknesses and helped me carve the path that I have carved for myself. Ed recognized my talent and had faith in me right from the start. I will be always grateful to him for that.You’re debuting a concerto at the end of the month titled “Guardian of the Horizon.” Can you tell us about it?The Sphinx Organization, which has done a fantastic job supporting black and Latino musicians, is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and they commissioned me to create the Concerto Grosso for Violin, Cello & Strings to celebrate the occasion. They are taking the piece on tour throughout several cities in the US, including their annual Gala Concert at Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium on October 13th. The work has been co-commissioned by the Sphinx Organization, with the support of Linda and Stuart Nelson, Carnegie Hall, and New World Symphony, and it is dedicated to my father’s memory, who passed away in December of last year. This work is also a part of Carnegie Hall’s “125 commissions” project, celebrating the famed institution’s 125th anniversary.You’ll be composer-in-residence at the Houston Symphony for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. What are your goals/aspirations for your time in Texas?During these two upcoming seasons I will be focusing on three major projects: a violin concerto, a symphony, and a mentorship program with young composers that will culminate on a concert consisting of new works by student composers from the Houston area. The violin concerto’s premiere has, sadly, had to be postponed in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but it will certainly take place during the 2018-19 season. The symphony will be premiered during the 2018-19 season and it will pay homage to Houston’s special contribution to space exploration. The mentorship program will be developed in conjunction with Professors from Rice University and University of Houston, and it will consist in the creation of new works, workshops with Houston Symphony musicians, interdisciplinary cooperation, and a final presentation at a special venue where the newly created works will be presented. In addition to all this, I will participate in talks, lectures, and chamber music concerts, plus other existing works of mine will be featured during the orchestra’s upcoming seasons.In the Denver Post, Ray Mark Rinaldi says “Lopez doesn’t sound like the other composers currently at work. His influences are broad, but he has a distinct voice and it is adventurous and winning. He’s making opera that sounds like him, rather than trying to emulate others.” How did you find your voice in terms of composition?During my time in Lima my eyes and ears were pointed toward Europe, so I didn’t pay much attention to my own country’s rich musical tradition. All of this changed when I moved to Finland because there I realized that in order to develop a distinct voice I could not continue ignoring my geographical origins. After coming to the US I continued to explore the Avant-garde scene, especially in Germany (Darmstadt and Donaueschingen), as I continued to delve into my geographical roots with works such as “Perú Negro”, which is entirely inspired by Afro-Peruvian music. These two parallel roads were not at odds with each other, but they were not necessarily interacting with each other, so in my mid thirties I made a conscious (and sometimes also unconscious) effort to integrate them into a single mode of expression. Nowadays I feel perfectly comfortable employing the tools I have learned from both of them and the result is a more unified and distinct personal voice that I think will continue to be shaped as I enter my forties. UC Berkeley Department of Music Professor Emeritus Richard Taruskin has been awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize. A notable honor, the Kyoto Prize has long been regarded by many as the most significant award available in fields that are traditionally not honored with a Nobel Prize.Bestowed annually since 1985 by the Inamori Foundation, the Prize is presented in three categories: Advanced Technology, Basic Sciences, and Arts and Philosophy. Taruskin joins prominent scholars to win the award including Noam Chamsky, Jane Goodall, Witold Lutosławski, and fellow UC Berkeley faculty member Richard Karp. The Kyoto Prize also comes with a 50 million Yen prize that will be awarded at the official ceremonies in Kyoto, Japan in November.“It’s obvious that he is the most important music historian of his generation in this country – perhaps in the world,” said Princeton University musicologist Simon Morrison of Taruskin.A world-renowned musicologist, music historian, and critic Taruskin came to UC Berkeley Music in 1986. Previously he served numerous roles at Columbia University where he earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. While at Columbia he worked as choral conductor and played viola da gamba with the well-known Aulos Ensemble.While at UC Berkeley he published widely including his widely-lauded six volume “Oxford History of Western Music” which examines the whole of the European musical history. He retired from the UC Berkeley Department of Music in 2014.Read more:

Throughout the year, Hertz Hall has been bursting with students as we absorbed the overflow from a closed Wheeler Auditorium under renovation. We look forward to a quieter fall season.  Our student orchestra has been incredibly busy this year with an active schedule of traditional and new works e in preparation for going on tour to Spain at the end of May.  On the faculty side of things, I’m happy to announce two new endowed chair appointments: Professor James Davies will hold the Henry and Julia Weisman Schutt Chair, and Professor Ken Ueno will hold the Jerry and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers Chair.  In the fall, we will be welcoming Delia Casadei, a musicologist, and in the fall of 2018 Maria Sonevytsky, an ethnomusicologist will be joining the faculty.

We will greatly miss Professor Davitt Moroney, who retired in December, 2016.Professor Moroney is a renowned harpsichordist and scholar, specializing in French and English 17th-18th century music as well as the music of J.S. Bach.  He was also appointed as the University Organist, and led the effort to replace our older concert organ with the beautiful Noack Baroque organ installed behind the stage in Hertz Hall.  He received numerous awards for his performances and recorded hundreds of works. One of the most memorable occasions for me was his series for Cal Performances where he performed the entire cycle of the Well-Tempered Clavier of Bach, and you could see patrons throughout the audience showing up with their scores to follow along with the music.  Perhaps most famously, in 2007 Professor Moroney discovered a long lost mass by Alessandro Striggio, an enormous choral work written for 40 and 60 parts, and conducted the first performance of it since the 16th century.  In his retirement, he will be returning to Paris although we hope that he will continue to visit and perform here in Berkeley!

I would also like to recognize that our intrepid sound engineer Jay Cloidt, who has been with us since 2009, will be retiring as of this June.  It will be very challenging to replace Jay, as he has always gone above and beyond the call for us.  

We had a lovely commencement ceremony for the Music Department on May 14, and you can see the results in the “Class of 2017: By the Numbers” article here. I know that I speak for the entire faculty when I say that we are genuinely proud of all of our students and their accomplishments.  It is rewarding to watch students mature into performers, scholars, and composers over the course of their studies with us.  We all gain from the music they make, the exchange of ideas, and the fresh perspectives they bring.  

The end of this spring marks my third year as Chair of the Music department.  Next year I will be on sabbatical, and I will pass the baton to the very capable hands of Professor Edmund Campion.  After my leave, I plan to return as Chair in the year-after-next.  Please do welcome Professor Campion when we return in the fall and expect to be hearing more from him!I was born in Bucharest, Romania. My family was, as one would say, “very creative”: my mom is a visual artist, my dad had studied classical violin for ten years, my grandmother was a classically trained soprano and my great-aunt was a piano teacher. My parents and godparents took me to classical concerts since I was five, and made sure the house was always resonating with the sounds of the good ol’ classics; but I was never really around a piano. When I was seven my godmother had the idea to have me audition for the local music school, and Carmen Simu, who ended up being my first teacher, discovered what she thought was a particularly excellent ear — although she had no room for additional piano students in her studio at that time, so she suggested I check out the next-door violin studio. For whatever reason, I absolutely resisted taking that offer and demanded I still learn piano; and so it began. Driven above all, perhaps, by an ardent love of Beethoven (to whom I sent love letters in the form of paper airplanes when I was eight), I realized within the next year that I wanted to be a professional pianist. My fourth year I started more intensive studies with professor Carmen Enescu, who also taught at the Dinu Lipatti National College of Art, and in fifth grade, my parents and I moved to the United States where I began studies with Hans Boepple at Santa Clara University. By that time, I was sure that my future would center around the conservatory path; throughout middle school and high school, I worked strenuously to prepare for this and performed pieces like Chopin’s First Concerto and Prokofiev’s Second Concerto with orchestras, receiving several awards in national and international piano competitions in the process.Theodora Serbanescu Martin ’17After applying to many schools and finishing my undergraduate auditions, I had a curious experience as I weighed my options: most of the programs I’d gotten accepted into were conservatories, and just a couple were universities that I considered not necessarily back-ups — but certainly “alternatives.” Throughout middle school and high school, I also cultivated an interest in writing (anything from essays to music reviews for Peninsula Reviews), and a passion for English and Russian literature. Already by the beginning of senior year when I was looking at potential schools, I was thinking about pursuing a double major with English. In short, the reason I applied to Berkeley was because I knew the Department of English was ranked first in the country; I hadn’t really heard about the music program. But when I did receive my acceptance letter, I suddenly felt an unexpected, immovable feeling that I had to choose Berkeley; an inexplicable force drew me to the campus — which I had never even visited properly before except to hear a couple of concerts at Zellerbach. None of my family members, friends, or even I thought this would have ever been a serious choice, but for some reason, at the last minute, I felt imminent regret — that to choose a conservatory education would mean to give up my other varied intellectual interests; and I was not ready — I still had so much to learn, so much knowledge and culture to funnel into my mind and heart!

Berkeley gave me not only what I had somehow intuitively known it would, but something infinitely above what I would have ever hoped for. I’ll resist the urge to wax poetic about what a rich cultural experience even one day in Berkeley could be, but I can say that I’ve had, from the first moment on our campus, this feeling that I could only classify as “nostalgia for the present” — a heart-wrenching happiness, mixed with a determination that urged me to remind myself to enjoy every moment of it, because I would never feel this way again. (I mean, when else would I get to write poems at the Campanile at night and to smell that gentle mix of night jasmine and the drifting crispness of a San Francisco breeze?) Second semester of freshman year is when I really got involved in performance activities and started channeling my inner Hermione Granger in classes by doing “serious work” — beginning (of course) with the Beethoven course taught by the incomparable Nicholas Mathew, who encouraged me to explore the yet uncharted territory of my musical imagination, and to fulfill all my intellectual curiosities. Meeting the lovely historical keyboards in our department and learning to play them, expanding my already strong musical interests with classes such as James Davies’s Opera course and, as of lately, Prof. Roberts’s jointly taught course “Art & Activism,” becoming a part of the vivacious orchestra community as pianist in the UCBSO, sharing many beautiful lessons and musical moments with the ever-supportive, golden-hearted Martha Wasley, getting headaches from reading Adorno for my “Late Beethoven” graduate seminar, finding what I would classify as “musician soulmates” to play chamber music with, hearing free performances at Hertz and Zellerbach from ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic and talking to some of the members first-hand, add up to only a small percentage of the array of experiences that have made my time here in Berkeley unforgettable, and my educational self-development so comprehensive and thorough. 

Some of my highlights as music major include my performance of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto and my reading of Brahms’s Second Concerto with the UCBSO and the magnificent David Milnes, my four solo noon and evening concerts, the last of which I played on our Regier fortepiano, and the exciting process of designing and teaching for two semesters my DeCal on historically informed performance. Taking the last course the legendary Richard Taruskin ever taught will always be one of my fondest memories, as will my crazy independent study on Brahms with David Pereira, hearing James Davies’s pure and glittering laugh in the Morrison hallways, convincing myself to enjoy the many all-nighters I pulled to write gigantic over-the-page-limit papers for my history courses — and, of course, immersing myself in the over-the-top process of writing my honors thesis on Brahms, which included stuff like gawking at his manuscript in the Hargrove and trying to shield the fragile 155-year old paper from my acidic tears. For this project, I have received a 2017 Charlene Conrad Liebau Library Prize for Undergraduate Research and feel very thankful to all — professors, librarians, staff, family, friends — who have helped me through this process. Additionally, I am grateful to have been one of the recipients of the 2016 Eisner Prize in the Creative Arts — an honor for which I owe infinite thanks to everyone in the Department. 

Outside of music — and the Hargrove, which has become my second home, especially those ML.410.B8’s, which I had started to claim as my own (to the detriment of my constantly overdue library card) — my endeavors as English major and German minor gave me equally rich experiences that I do not have room to write about in here. All I can say is that sometimes I felt like three people in one, trying simultaneously to wrap my head around that un-translated version of Goethe and to finally understand the Genetiv, to get through the first book of Spenser’s Faerie Queene in one weekend because I had “procrastinated” on reading it by practicing Brahms for hours, and to scramble to write most of my overflowing English honors thesis on my man Sir Thomas Wyatt and his impossibly interesting, perplexing poetry in the last two months because I had a concert every month before and I “just didn’t have time.” 

Above all, it is the wonderful souls I’ve met in Berkeley who have made my experience what it was — the brilliant, caring professors, some of whom I know will be life-long connections, the patient roommates and best friends, the fellow Music and English majors who were always excellent at commiserating, and even that guy on Sproul who always shouts about global warming and how our education is actually brainwashing rather than enlightening us. And not to forget the squirrels, of course! 

It is difficult for me to accept that I have to leave this magical place soon, but at the same time I know that my experience at Berkeley — which has fostered my process of self-understanding — has already equipped me with more independence and self-sufficiency than I already possessed intrinsically. In the fall I will be heading off to Cornell University to continue my studies of music with a Musicology PhD. Currently my most important professional goal is to cultivate a career as performing scholar — to blend equally musicology and piano performance, and to advocate for interdisciplinary work of all sorts. More specifically, I hope to become a Brahms scholar — and yes, to keep performing tons of Beethoven and, well, any and all German Romantic piano music. Whatever I do, I am confident that everything I learned and experienced at Berkeley will give me the strength and knowledge to navigate all that the mysterious future will bring. Studying across disciplines and challenging conventions is something that has always been encouraged at UC Berkeley. Students’ coursework regularly spans across academia; but today’s world requires the ability to integrate knowledge and theory from multiple disciplines. Thanks to the launch of UC Berkeley’s Certificate in Design Innovation (BCDI), students will earn credit for taking courses focused on integration of methods, technologies, knowledge, and thought from a wide range of different disciplines. BCDI curriculum includes current courses, as well as newly developed classes with an emphasis on design innovation.A cornerstone of of the coursework for BCDI is Berkeley’s Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT). Founded by Professor Emeritus Richard Felciano in the late 1980s, CNMAT is known worldwide for audio research and linking the concert hall to the laboratory. Two new courses, Music 158A (Sound and Music Computing with CNMAT Technologies) and Music 158B (Situated Instrument Design for Musical Expression), were developed with grant support from the Digital Humanities at Berkeley. The new course development grants provided the opportunity for CNMAT to further integrate its 25-year legacy of research and digital tool development into the life of our Department of Music and greater University.“CNMAT and the Department of Music are excited to have their two new cornerstone courses in Music and Technology included in the BCDI,” said CNMAT Director and Music Professor Edmund Campion. “Music, design, and innovation go hand in hand, and it is very satisfying to find these new courses adopted for the BCDI.”Departments offering BCDI curriculum include Architecture, Art Practice, Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Design, Theatre, and Haas Business School. An added benefit of BCDI is students’ opportunity to take courses outside of their major, that they may not otherwise be able to be able to attend.-Alex CoughlinWhen David E. Fastovsky was a graduate student studying Paleontology at UC Berkeley in the 1970’s he was presented with the opportunity to play numerous rare instruments, including a prized Vuillaume viola in the Music Department’s rare instrument collection.“I told my current string quartet about the Vuillaume, and they were astounded – asking, ‘Did you know what it was?’ I definitely knew what it was.”Almost four decades later, he is adding to the Department’s collection of rare instruments by donating a rare Louis Lot flute and a wooden Buffet piccolo.The two instruments’ journey to Berkeley had many twists and turns. Louis Lot was a French flute maker who rose to prominence by pioneering new methods of flute manufacturing during the nineteenth century. By 1860, Lot became the official supplier of flutes to the Paris Conservatoire and gained further international notoriety. The flute (Serial number 6846) was manufactured around 1900. The Buffet piccolo was built roughly the same time by Buffet Crampon, a noted Parisian manufacturer of woodwinds.Fastovsky’s father Ashley was given the instruments as part of a Philharmonic scholarship while in high school in New York City playing with the All-City High School Orchestra in the late 1930’s. Ashley Fastovsky played it regularly again in the late 1970’s, during which time he had the flute restored. The Lot flute is not only notable because of its high-quality craftsmanship, but the purity of sound not found in modern instruments.The instruments join Music’s impressive collection which spans from rare Baroque-period woodwinds to thousands of choral pieces from various centuries. Of course, the Vuillaume Fastovsky played as a student still resides as part of the prized Salz collection of antique violins, violas and bows donated in 1964.“I cannot tell you how inspiring it was for my playing to be able to play on such an instrument,” said Fastovsky. “Perhaps somebody can love the Louis Lot the way I loved that Vuillaume.”Fastovsky serves as Chair of the Department of Geosciences at the University of Rhode Island. He is the co-author of “Dinosaurs: A Concise History” (Cambridge University Press).-Alex CoughlinZhoushu Ziporyn Noon Concert performance in September 2016Zhoushu Ziporyn was drawn to the UC Berkeley Department of Music for a number of reasons. The open and very friendly atmosphere, a holistic academic approach, an extensive library collection, and an amazing and open-minded faculty all drew Ziporyn to UC Berkeley.“I ended up in Cal because I like what it stands for. I was intrigued by the diversity of ensemble groups offered at the music program,” noted Ziporyn.Ziporyn started his musical career early, learning the violin as a child. He later found inspiration in the works of an eclectic collection of artists: Bach, The Beatles, Bill Evans, Prokofiev and Japanese traditional Gagaku music. As Ziporyn grew older he began playing in jazz and rock bands in his high school years and frequently jammed with his friends.Since coming to Cal, Ziporyn has amassed an impressive academic and musical record. He won the 2016 Alfred Hertz Memorial Traveling Scholarship, allowing him to visit Japan and study traditional Japanese instruments, as well as learning from the masters of the Nō Theatre tradition. He also was a winner of the Department’s Nicola de Lorenzo Prize for composition in 2015-16. This semester, he opened the 2016 Fall Noon Concert series with an original solo piece for electric violin titled “The Absurdity of Now and Then.”The University Baroque Ensemble performed a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuatre qui fait plisser les yeux” by Music major Zhoushu Ziporyn at Director Davitt Moroney’s final performance at Hertz Hall before his retirement.The University Baroque Ensemble performed a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuatre qui fait plisser les yeux” by Music major Zhoushu ZiporynZiporyn is also a gifted composer. He’s penned original works such as “Gimme Some Context,” “Sleep’s Tree,” and “If Only You Were Cool” while he served as an Emerging Artist with The Sheldon Brown Quartet at the Emerald Tablet in San Francisco. He also worked collaboratively as musical artist in “Cine/Spin,” creating the music for the feature film “Valerie and Her Week of Wonders” (Jaromil Jires, 1969) at UC Berkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA). Ziporyn also authored a collection of “Poetry Fugues for Seekers” in collaboration with UC Berkeley Astronomer Alexei Filippenko and Mycologist John Taylor.Most recently Ziporyn wrote a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuâtre qui fait plisser les yeux” which was premiered and performed by Director Davitt Moroney at the final University Baroque Ensemble concert before the Director’s retirement from UC Berkeley.With graduation on the horizon on spring 2017, Ziporyn plans on returning to Japan to spend a year furthering his studies with the masters in the traditional arts of Japan. As a culmination of his studies in Japan last June, he will be premiering a segment of his musical theatre, “Tomorrow’s Sound,” with the Theatre of Yūgen in San Francisco May 2017. He’s also working with a special group of musicians and actors to materialize “Star Wars Palimpsest: Luke as A Pagan Hero,” an original musical theatre work that pits the parallels between the cosmology of the Star Wars movies with the story of Abraham and Isaac in the Bible, as a kind of postmodern cantata that aims to provoke further flexibility of thought.“I honestly can’t believe that it’s already been four years. It has truly been a blast,” noted Ziporyn summing up his time at UC Berkeley. “As I face a future unknown to me about to unfold, one thing I do know is that I will always cherish my time at Cal and think back to it as a solid foundation to my future self and endeavors.”Nicholas MathewUC Berkeley Associate Professor of Music Nicholas Mathew’s schedule is pretty full most semesters. Between teaching a range of research and performance courses, maintaining a schedule of piano performances, and continuing to publish new research on late eighteenth-century music there is not much time for anything else in his professional calendar. But this year Mathew added more to his plate: a fellowship at UC Berkeley’s Townsend Center, helping to curate a series of concerts and lectures dedicated to the Mendelssohn family at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life, and designing a program of special events with the Takács Quartet, hosted by Cal Performances.“It’s been a busy year intellectually and musically,” said Mathew “but I’ve enjoyed the chance to engage the public in different ways.”Mathew has been researching across disciplines for some time, so a fellowship at the Townsend Center was a natural fit. Founded in 1987, the Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities encourages interdisciplinary scholarship, awarding fellowships annually to researchers whose academic interests traverse multiple disciplines. Mathew’s first book, Political Beethoven, was an interdisciplinary study that combined thickly textured material history and political theory alongside close music analysis. This year, his Townsend Fellowship will support a new project that focuses on music-making and commercial life in the expanding metropolitan centers of late eighteenth-century Europe, particularly with respect to the music of Beethoven’s most famous teacher, Joseph Haydn.When Cal Performances announced that the Takács Quartet would be performing the complete cycle of Beethoven quartets in Berkeley, they approached Mathew, along with the Takács’ first violinist Edward Dusinberre, to discuss how they might design new ways of engaging with these well-known works.  The first installment of this high-profile collaboration took place in October.“Ed and I already knew each other a little, because he had been completing a fantastic book about the Beethoven quartets and the compelling history of the Takács Quartet itself — so a stimulating collaboration was practically inevitable,” said Mathew.The Takács Quartet returns to Berkeley in March and April 2017, when Mathew will be joined by Mark Ferraguto (Penn State) and Mary Hunter (Bowdoin College) to talk — appropriately enough, in the Bay Area — about the “new media” of the early nineteenth century, and their consequences for Beethoven’s string quartets.So what will Mathew do to follow up his dizzying 2016-17?“Well, I’m on leave — and I hope to return waving a brand new book in the air. Fingers crossed.”Credit: Rick PeckhamAlexander Kahn graduated from UC Berkeley Music with his Ph.D. in 2008.

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Music Department offers two types of special studies courses:These courses are designed for music students at Berkeley to pursue a study on any music-related topics or explore ideas as an extension of the regular undergraduate curriculum. They are proposed, initiated, and implemented by students under the guidance of a faculty member.Effective Fall 2015, all students, regardless of their class standing, are eligible in the upper-division version of these courses. 1-4 units, P/NP. A student-initiated, student-run group study course on a topic or topics in music, such as a DeCal course. Many directed-group study courses in Music are commonly DeCal courses, but not exclusively so.Facilitating a Music 198 course requires extensive prior planning. Potential student facilitators should begin the planning process in the semester prior and are responsible for securing a faculty sponsor. One resource is the Music Department faculty directory.In a given semester, student coordinators may not facilitate more than one Music 198; faculty may not sponsor more than one Music 198 per semester.Student coordinators may not facilitate more than one Music 198 per semester; faculty may not sponsor more than one Music 198 per semester. Students must be registered in the semester they are facilitating the course.See DeCal Classes for more information on taking or facilitating a DeCal courses. 1-3 units, P/NP. A student-initiated, student-implemented program of individual study on a topic or topics in Music.Enrollment in Music 199 is agreed upon in advance between the student and the faculty sponsor, with the expectation that each unit represent 3 hours of work/week (45 hours/semester). Students should discuss their idea for the independent project and submit a faculty-approved Independent Study Application. © 2017 UC Regents.

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedAs a member of an institution that is dedicated to a liberal education in the arts and humanities, our Department of Music sees our role as offering a major that introduces the students to all aspects of the study of music and thereby prepares them for any number of ways to make music meaningful and useful in their lives after graduations. We use the phrase “integrated” to distinguish our major from the program one would follow, for example, in a School of Music (i.e., conservatory within a university) where the emphasis is put almost exclusively on training for a professional career as a performer. We want our students to be exposed to all facets of music—historical and cultural studies, composition, improvisation, conducting, music and technology, and, of course performance which takes a central position in our course offerings. This, we believe, is well suited to the diverse needs of the students who want to study music, as majors or minors, at Berkeley, whether or not they intend to pursue a professional career in music.Our graduates have entered any number of fields. They become lawyers and bankers for instance, directors or fundraisers in non-profit sectors, audio editors in the film industry, public school teachers, professors of music, or professional performers, to mention a few fields of endeavor. Therefore, we encourage our students to shape their program according to their particular interests, using the required units of upper division music electives and, if they wish, additional courses from both within and outside the department.As students in the College of Letters and Science, our majors can combine their specialized knowledge in music with other aspects of their education at Berkeley. Through the breadth requirements of the College of Letters and Sciences as well as through our diverse program of music study, our majors are acquiring the very skills that the Career Placement Center staff report that businesses are looking for: writing and other communication skills, critical thinking, practice at learning how to learn very diverse subject matter as is required in the contemporary job market, and knowledge that contributes to successful participation in a very diverse society. Apparently, the major most sought after in applicants by medical schools is music.The Undergraduate Committee of the Department plans career workshops annually. In Spring 2007, for one instance, alumna Antoinette Thomas (class of 1962 and a successful public school teacher of music) led a workshop on careers in music education. For students interested in exploring the field of arts administration, in 2008, a workshop on “Music Management and Administration” was held, with speakers Adam Frey, Executive Director of the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players and Peter Williams, Artistic Director of Yoshi’s Jazz Club. UCB alumni and graduate students in ethnomusicology and musicology presented on graduate studies in music for students thinking about that possibility, and “Careers in Performance” featured successful UCB alumni in that area. The workshops vary from year to year.For questions about the major requirements contact Zoe Xu at musicadvising@berkeley.edu.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedOn Friday, November 3 the carillon bells located in Sather Tower (the Campanile) will mark their 100th anniversary. Although originally cast in 1915 by the John Taylor Bell foundry of Loughborough, England, the bells were not installed in Sather Tower until 1917 due to delays caused by World War I. The bells were first played for three hours on November 3, 1917, joined by all the bells and whistles of Berkeley.“The bells of Berkeley are so strongly integrated into the daily life of the campus community that they are the aural icons of Berkeley,” noted University Carillonist Jeff Davis.To celebrate the 100-year mark of the carillon, Davis will be inviting a variety of carillonists and composers to collaborate on performances throughout the year. The festivities will culminate in the summer with the 2018 UC Berkeley Carillon Festival. These activities will also seek to raise awareness and funds for much needed repairs to the instrument.Although the UC Berkeley Carillon enjoys fame well beyond the Bay Area, long overdue maintenance threatens to silence the bells.  Crucial improvements were made in 1983, but significant repairs are still needed. For example, the transmission mechanism on any carillon generally needs to be redone every twenty years, a length of time that we have long-since surpassed.  At Berkeley, routine upkeep is exacerbated by the location of the instrument directly across from the Golden Gate, a location that, while beautiful, is extraordinarily rough on the instrument.  The result is that rust and other mechanical problems caused by the uninterrupted action of salt air and wind, have made the instrument increasingly difficult to play.We appeal to everyone in the Berkeley community, past and present, to help renovate and rejuvenate this true treasure of our shared life.The UC Berkeley Carillon has enjoyed incremental progress over the decades.

We have an exciting schedule planned for this semester. Join us as we celebrate the 65th year of the free Noon Concert Series in Hertz Hall, a Music Department project that has brought high-quality live music performances to hundreds of thousands of appreciative listeners from across the campus, the community and the larger Bay Area.  This fall, our Department of Music will offer a splendid array of musical styles ranging from Orchestra and Choirs, to Jazz, and Gamelan, to the newest composition creations.  We do it all, and we continue to thrive in the midst of tough financial times, thanks to the wonderful generosity of our many supporters.  A quick look at the programming reveals the incredible University Symphony, just returned from a tour of Spain under conductor David Milnes, the choral programs with Nikolas Nackley and Magen Solomon directing, the Gospel Choir led by Dr. Mark Wilson, and Gamelan with famed Javanese Gamelan master Midiyanto.  It is all excellent music, with over 25 concerts this semester! Get to your seats early for the large ensemble concerts as these events will fill the hall. At the core of everything we do is the dedication of our Hertz Hall staff and the hundreds of talented and devoted musicians who give their lives to the rich traditions of music making.  Nothing is really free, but together with the support and encouragement of our esteemed audiences, we make it happen.  Our key message will always be that live music, small and large, and from every point on the globe, indicates good social health and contributes to a richer and more peaceful community.  Help us if you can with any level of donation.  Or feel free to reach out to the Chair for more information and conversation.Delia Casadei, a musicologist specializing in 20th-century Italy has joined The UC Berkeley Department of Music as an Assistant Professor. A native of Italy, Casadei completed her undergraduate and Master’s degree at King’s College London. She earned her Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania, where she was awarded a Hopkinson Graduate Research Fellowship, a Mellon Humanities Fellowship, and Alvin H. Johnson AMS 50 Dissertation Completion Fellowship. Casadei spent the last year at Jesus College in Cambridge where she completed a Junior Research Fellowship.“I am honored to join the music department at Berkeley, a place I have long admired from afar” said Casadei. “Since arriving a couple of months ago I have had many exciting conversations with historians, ethnomusicologists, performers and composers, and most importantly students. This is a strange and sometimes frightening time to be in the U.S. and I feel privileged to share the campus with people who are passionate and ask difficult questions about the world that surrounds them.” Casadei’s research focuses on the politics of the voice’s relationship to language, particularly in the Italian twentieth century. Her thesis examined this relationship by way of Milan in the 1950s-70s, and she is currently researching her first book, which will examine key political theories formulated in Italy between the 1950s and today and the manner in which these approaches are tied to the use of recording technology. Aside from her research on 20th century Italian musicology, Casadei also studies the historical relationship of music and laughter in the twentieth century.On Friday, November 3 the carillon bells located in Sather Tower (the Campanile) will mark their 100th anniversary. Although originally cast in 1915 by the John Taylor Bell foundry of Loughborough, England, the bells were not installed in Sather Tower until 1917 due to delays caused by World War I. The bells were first played for three hours on November 3, 1917, joined by all the bells and whistles of Berkeley.“The bells of Berkeley are so strongly integrated into the daily life of the campus community that they are the aural icons of Berkeley,” noted University Carillonist Jeff Davis. To celebrate the 100-year mark of the carillon, Davis will be inviting a variety of carillonists and composers to collaborate on performances throughout the year. The festivities will culminate in the summer with the 2018 UC Berkeley Carillon Festival. These activities will also seek to raise awareness and funds for much needed repairs to the instrument. Although the UC Berkeley Carillon enjoys fame well beyond the Bay Area, long overdue maintenance threatens to silence the bells.  Crucial improvements were made in 1983, but significant repairs are still needed. For example, the transmission mechanism on any carillon generally needs to be redone every twenty years, a length of time that we have long-since surpassed.  At Berkeley, routine upkeep is exacerbated by the location of the instrument directly across from the Golden Gate, a location that, while beautiful, is extraordinarily rough on the instrument.  The result is that rust and other mechanical problems caused by the uninterrupted action of salt air and wind, have made the instrument increasingly difficult to play.We appeal to everyone in the Berkeley community, past and present, to help renovate and rejuvenate this true treasure of our shared life.  The UC Berkeley Carillon has enjoyed incremental progress over the decades. The original twelve bell chime did not have enough notes to play pieces such as the National Anthem. So in 1978, the Class of 1928, as a fiftieth anniversary gift to the University, decided to raise funds to add a few bells so more tunes could be played. The improvements to the instrument sparked interest throughout the world, and in 1983, thanks to a generation donation by Jerry and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers, the carillon expanded to 61 bells.

How were the conservatories different from your experience in Berkeley?All those places are incredibly different from each other. In Lima I acquired a solid base, especially in regards to harmony, counterpoint, and music theory in general. All of this especially thanks to my mentor and -as I like to call him- my “personal Yoda”, Enrique Iturriaga, a 99-year-old composer who has made an indelible mark in Peruvian musical life. The Sibelius Academy reinforced that base but it provided me with great exposure to Finland’s (and by extension, Europe’s) rich contemporary music scene. It also gave me plenty of opportunities to explore my fascination for the symphony orchestra, not only because Finland, a country of 5.5 million, boasts 25 professional orchestras, but also because the Sibelius Academy itself has a very strong orchestral conducting department, a fact that allowed me to try a few of my compositions in rehearsal. What I took from Berkeley was creative freedom. Europe has strong traditions and it is hard for Europeans to let go of them sometimes. California, in turn, is fertile ground for innovation in many areas, the kind of innovation and openness that allowed the birth of Minimalism, for example. It is here, at Berkeley, where I was able to distill my language and find my personal voice.Edmund Campion was your advisor at Cal. What was the most significant thing you took away from him?Ed believed, and still believes, in me and my music. He had real faith in that, as competitive as it is, I could make it in the music industry. He guided me through my transition from the world of academia to the hard realities of being a freelance composer. He recognized my strength,s and weaknesses and helped me carve the path that I have carved for myself. Ed recognized my talent and had faith in me right from the start. I will be always grateful to him for that.You’re debuting a concerto at the end of the month titled “Guardian of the Horizon.” Can you tell us about it?The Sphinx Organization, which has done a fantastic job supporting black and Latino musicians, is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and they commissioned me to create the Concerto Grosso for Violin, Cello & Strings to celebrate the occasion. They are taking the piece on tour throughout several cities in the US, including their annual Gala Concert at Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium on October 13th. The work has been co-commissioned by the Sphinx Organization, with the support of Linda and Stuart Nelson, Carnegie Hall, and New World Symphony, and it is dedicated to my father’s memory, who passed away in December of last year. This work is also a part of Carnegie Hall’s “125 commissions” project, celebrating the famed institution’s 125th anniversary.You’ll be composer-in-residence at the Houston Symphony for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. What are your goals/aspirations for your time in Texas?During these two upcoming seasons I will be focusing on three major projects: a violin concerto, a symphony, and a mentorship program with young composers that will culminate on a concert consisting of new works by student composers from the Houston area. The violin concerto’s premiere has, sadly, had to be postponed in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but it will certainly take place during the 2018-19 season. The symphony will be premiered during the 2018-19 season and it will pay homage to Houston’s special contribution to space exploration. The mentorship program will be developed in conjunction with Professors from Rice University and University of Houston, and it will consist in the creation of new works, workshops with Houston Symphony musicians, interdisciplinary cooperation, and a final presentation at a special venue where the newly created works will be presented. In addition to all this, I will participate in talks, lectures, and chamber music concerts, plus other existing works of mine will be featured during the orchestra’s upcoming seasons.In the Denver Post, Ray Mark Rinaldi says “Lopez doesn’t sound like the other composers currently at work. His influences are broad, but he has a distinct voice and it is adventurous and winning. He’s making opera that sounds like him, rather than trying to emulate others.” How did you find your voice in terms of composition?During my time in Lima my eyes and ears were pointed toward Europe, so I didn’t pay much attention to my own country’s rich musical tradition. All of this changed when I moved to Finland because there I realized that in order to develop a distinct voice I could not continue ignoring my geographical origins. After coming to the US I continued to explore the Avant-garde scene, especially in Germany (Darmstadt and Donaueschingen), as I continued to delve into my geographical roots with works such as “Perú Negro”, which is entirely inspired by Afro-Peruvian music. These two parallel roads were not at odds with each other, but they were not necessarily interacting with each other, so in my mid thirties I made a conscious (and sometimes also unconscious) effort to integrate them into a single mode of expression. Nowadays I feel perfectly comfortable employing the tools I have learned from both of them and the result is a more unified and distinct personal voice that I think will continue to be shaped as I enter my forties. UC Berkeley Department of Music Professor Emeritus Richard Taruskin has been awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize. A notable honor, the Kyoto Prize has long been regarded by many as the most significant award available in fields that are traditionally not honored with a Nobel Prize.Bestowed annually since 1985 by the Inamori Foundation, the Prize is presented in three categories: Advanced Technology, Basic Sciences, and Arts and Philosophy. Taruskin joins prominent scholars to win the award including Noam Chamsky, Jane Goodall, Witold Lutosławski, and fellow UC Berkeley faculty member Richard Karp. The Kyoto Prize also comes with a 50 million Yen prize that will be awarded at the official ceremonies in Kyoto, Japan in November.“It’s obvious that he is the most important music historian of his generation in this country – perhaps in the world,” said Princeton University musicologist Simon Morrison of Taruskin.A world-renowned musicologist, music historian, and critic Taruskin came to UC Berkeley Music in 1986. Previously he served numerous roles at Columbia University where he earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. While at Columbia he worked as choral conductor and played viola da gamba with the well-known Aulos Ensemble.While at UC Berkeley he published widely including his widely-lauded six volume “Oxford History of Western Music” which examines the whole of the European musical history. He retired from the UC Berkeley Department of Music in 2014.Read more:

Throughout the year, Hertz Hall has been bursting with students as we absorbed the overflow from a closed Wheeler Auditorium under renovation. We look forward to a quieter fall season.  Our student orchestra has been incredibly busy this year with an active schedule of traditional and new works e in preparation for going on tour to Spain at the end of May.  On the faculty side of things, I’m happy to announce two new endowed chair appointments: Professor James Davies will hold the Henry and Julia Weisman Schutt Chair, and Professor Ken Ueno will hold the Jerry and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers Chair.  In the fall, we will be welcoming Delia Casadei, a musicologist, and in the fall of 2018 Maria Sonevytsky, an ethnomusicologist will be joining the faculty.

We will greatly miss Professor Davitt Moroney, who retired in December, 2016.Professor Moroney is a renowned harpsichordist and scholar, specializing in French and English 17th-18th century music as well as the music of J.S. Bach.  He was also appointed as the University Organist, and led the effort to replace our older concert organ with the beautiful Noack Baroque organ installed behind the stage in Hertz Hall.  He received numerous awards for his performances and recorded hundreds of works. One of the most memorable occasions for me was his series for Cal Performances where he performed the entire cycle of the Well-Tempered Clavier of Bach, and you could see patrons throughout the audience showing up with their scores to follow along with the music.  Perhaps most famously, in 2007 Professor Moroney discovered a long lost mass by Alessandro Striggio, an enormous choral work written for 40 and 60 parts, and conducted the first performance of it since the 16th century.  In his retirement, he will be returning to Paris although we hope that he will continue to visit and perform here in Berkeley!

I would also like to recognize that our intrepid sound engineer Jay Cloidt, who has been with us since 2009, will be retiring as of this June.  It will be very challenging to replace Jay, as he has always gone above and beyond the call for us.  

We had a lovely commencement ceremony for the Music Department on May 14, and you can see the results in the “Class of 2017: By the Numbers” article here. I know that I speak for the entire faculty when I say that we are genuinely proud of all of our students and their accomplishments.  It is rewarding to watch students mature into performers, scholars, and composers over the course of their studies with us.  We all gain from the music they make, the exchange of ideas, and the fresh perspectives they bring.  

The end of this spring marks my third year as Chair of the Music department.  Next year I will be on sabbatical, and I will pass the baton to the very capable hands of Professor Edmund Campion.  After my leave, I plan to return as Chair in the year-after-next.  Please do welcome Professor Campion when we return in the fall and expect to be hearing more from him!I was born in Bucharest, Romania. My family was, as one would say, “very creative”: my mom is a visual artist, my dad had studied classical violin for ten years, my grandmother was a classically trained soprano and my great-aunt was a piano teacher. My parents and godparents took me to classical concerts since I was five, and made sure the house was always resonating with the sounds of the good ol’ classics; but I was never really around a piano. When I was seven my godmother had the idea to have me audition for the local music school, and Carmen Simu, who ended up being my first teacher, discovered what she thought was a particularly excellent ear — although she had no room for additional piano students in her studio at that time, so she suggested I check out the next-door violin studio. For whatever reason, I absolutely resisted taking that offer and demanded I still learn piano; and so it began. Driven above all, perhaps, by an ardent love of Beethoven (to whom I sent love letters in the form of paper airplanes when I was eight), I realized within the next year that I wanted to be a professional pianist. My fourth year I started more intensive studies with professor Carmen Enescu, who also taught at the Dinu Lipatti National College of Art, and in fifth grade, my parents and I moved to the United States where I began studies with Hans Boepple at Santa Clara University. By that time, I was sure that my future would center around the conservatory path; throughout middle school and high school, I worked strenuously to prepare for this and performed pieces like Chopin’s First Concerto and Prokofiev’s Second Concerto with orchestras, receiving several awards in national and international piano competitions in the process.Theodora Serbanescu Martin ’17After applying to many schools and finishing my undergraduate auditions, I had a curious experience as I weighed my options: most of the programs I’d gotten accepted into were conservatories, and just a couple were universities that I considered not necessarily back-ups — but certainly “alternatives.” Throughout middle school and high school, I also cultivated an interest in writing (anything from essays to music reviews for Peninsula Reviews), and a passion for English and Russian literature. Already by the beginning of senior year when I was looking at potential schools, I was thinking about pursuing a double major with English. In short, the reason I applied to Berkeley was because I knew the Department of English was ranked first in the country; I hadn’t really heard about the music program. But when I did receive my acceptance letter, I suddenly felt an unexpected, immovable feeling that I had to choose Berkeley; an inexplicable force drew me to the campus — which I had never even visited properly before except to hear a couple of concerts at Zellerbach. None of my family members, friends, or even I thought this would have ever been a serious choice, but for some reason, at the last minute, I felt imminent regret — that to choose a conservatory education would mean to give up my other varied intellectual interests; and I was not ready — I still had so much to learn, so much knowledge and culture to funnel into my mind and heart!

Berkeley gave me not only what I had somehow intuitively known it would, but something infinitely above what I would have ever hoped for. I’ll resist the urge to wax poetic about what a rich cultural experience even one day in Berkeley could be, but I can say that I’ve had, from the first moment on our campus, this feeling that I could only classify as “nostalgia for the present” — a heart-wrenching happiness, mixed with a determination that urged me to remind myself to enjoy every moment of it, because I would never feel this way again. (I mean, when else would I get to write poems at the Campanile at night and to smell that gentle mix of night jasmine and the drifting crispness of a San Francisco breeze?) Second semester of freshman year is when I really got involved in performance activities and started channeling my inner Hermione Granger in classes by doing “serious work” — beginning (of course) with the Beethoven course taught by the incomparable Nicholas Mathew, who encouraged me to explore the yet uncharted territory of my musical imagination, and to fulfill all my intellectual curiosities. Meeting the lovely historical keyboards in our department and learning to play them, expanding my already strong musical interests with classes such as James Davies’s Opera course and, as of lately, Prof. Roberts’s jointly taught course “Art & Activism,” becoming a part of the vivacious orchestra community as pianist in the UCBSO, sharing many beautiful lessons and musical moments with the ever-supportive, golden-hearted Martha Wasley, getting headaches from reading Adorno for my “Late Beethoven” graduate seminar, finding what I would classify as “musician soulmates” to play chamber music with, hearing free performances at Hertz and Zellerbach from ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic and talking to some of the members first-hand, add up to only a small percentage of the array of experiences that have made my time here in Berkeley unforgettable, and my educational self-development so comprehensive and thorough. 

Some of my highlights as music major include my performance of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto and my reading of Brahms’s Second Concerto with the UCBSO and the magnificent David Milnes, my four solo noon and evening concerts, the last of which I played on our Regier fortepiano, and the exciting process of designing and teaching for two semesters my DeCal on historically informed performance. Taking the last course the legendary Richard Taruskin ever taught will always be one of my fondest memories, as will my crazy independent study on Brahms with David Pereira, hearing James Davies’s pure and glittering laugh in the Morrison hallways, convincing myself to enjoy the many all-nighters I pulled to write gigantic over-the-page-limit papers for my history courses — and, of course, immersing myself in the over-the-top process of writing my honors thesis on Brahms, which included stuff like gawking at his manuscript in the Hargrove and trying to shield the fragile 155-year old paper from my acidic tears. For this project, I have received a 2017 Charlene Conrad Liebau Library Prize for Undergraduate Research and feel very thankful to all — professors, librarians, staff, family, friends — who have helped me through this process. Additionally, I am grateful to have been one of the recipients of the 2016 Eisner Prize in the Creative Arts — an honor for which I owe infinite thanks to everyone in the Department. 

Outside of music — and the Hargrove, which has become my second home, especially those ML.410.B8’s, which I had started to claim as my own (to the detriment of my constantly overdue library card) — my endeavors as English major and German minor gave me equally rich experiences that I do not have room to write about in here. All I can say is that sometimes I felt like three people in one, trying simultaneously to wrap my head around that un-translated version of Goethe and to finally understand the Genetiv, to get through the first book of Spenser’s Faerie Queene in one weekend because I had “procrastinated” on reading it by practicing Brahms for hours, and to scramble to write most of my overflowing English honors thesis on my man Sir Thomas Wyatt and his impossibly interesting, perplexing poetry in the last two months because I had a concert every month before and I “just didn’t have time.” 

Above all, it is the wonderful souls I’ve met in Berkeley who have made my experience what it was — the brilliant, caring professors, some of whom I know will be life-long connections, the patient roommates and best friends, the fellow Music and English majors who were always excellent at commiserating, and even that guy on Sproul who always shouts about global warming and how our education is actually brainwashing rather than enlightening us. And not to forget the squirrels, of course! 

It is difficult for me to accept that I have to leave this magical place soon, but at the same time I know that my experience at Berkeley — which has fostered my process of self-understanding — has already equipped me with more independence and self-sufficiency than I already possessed intrinsically. In the fall I will be heading off to Cornell University to continue my studies of music with a Musicology PhD. Currently my most important professional goal is to cultivate a career as performing scholar — to blend equally musicology and piano performance, and to advocate for interdisciplinary work of all sorts. More specifically, I hope to become a Brahms scholar — and yes, to keep performing tons of Beethoven and, well, any and all German Romantic piano music. Whatever I do, I am confident that everything I learned and experienced at Berkeley will give me the strength and knowledge to navigate all that the mysterious future will bring. Studying across disciplines and challenging conventions is something that has always been encouraged at UC Berkeley. Students’ coursework regularly spans across academia; but today’s world requires the ability to integrate knowledge and theory from multiple disciplines. Thanks to the launch of UC Berkeley’s Certificate in Design Innovation (BCDI), students will earn credit for taking courses focused on integration of methods, technologies, knowledge, and thought from a wide range of different disciplines. BCDI curriculum includes current courses, as well as newly developed classes with an emphasis on design innovation.A cornerstone of of the coursework for BCDI is Berkeley’s Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT). Founded by Professor Emeritus Richard Felciano in the late 1980s, CNMAT is known worldwide for audio research and linking the concert hall to the laboratory. Two new courses, Music 158A (Sound and Music Computing with CNMAT Technologies) and Music 158B (Situated Instrument Design for Musical Expression), were developed with grant support from the Digital Humanities at Berkeley. The new course development grants provided the opportunity for CNMAT to further integrate its 25-year legacy of research and digital tool development into the life of our Department of Music and greater University.“CNMAT and the Department of Music are excited to have their two new cornerstone courses in Music and Technology included in the BCDI,” said CNMAT Director and Music Professor Edmund Campion. “Music, design, and innovation go hand in hand, and it is very satisfying to find these new courses adopted for the BCDI.”Departments offering BCDI curriculum include Architecture, Art Practice, Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Design, Theatre, and Haas Business School. An added benefit of BCDI is students’ opportunity to take courses outside of their major, that they may not otherwise be able to be able to attend.-Alex CoughlinWhen David E. Fastovsky was a graduate student studying Paleontology at UC Berkeley in the 1970’s he was presented with the opportunity to play numerous rare instruments, including a prized Vuillaume viola in the Music Department’s rare instrument collection.“I told my current string quartet about the Vuillaume, and they were astounded – asking, ‘Did you know what it was?’ I definitely knew what it was.”Almost four decades later, he is adding to the Department’s collection of rare instruments by donating a rare Louis Lot flute and a wooden Buffet piccolo.The two instruments’ journey to Berkeley had many twists and turns. Louis Lot was a French flute maker who rose to prominence by pioneering new methods of flute manufacturing during the nineteenth century. By 1860, Lot became the official supplier of flutes to the Paris Conservatoire and gained further international notoriety. The flute (Serial number 6846) was manufactured around 1900. The Buffet piccolo was built roughly the same time by Buffet Crampon, a noted Parisian manufacturer of woodwinds.Fastovsky’s father Ashley was given the instruments as part of a Philharmonic scholarship while in high school in New York City playing with the All-City High School Orchestra in the late 1930’s. Ashley Fastovsky played it regularly again in the late 1970’s, during which time he had the flute restored. The Lot flute is not only notable because of its high-quality craftsmanship, but the purity of sound not found in modern instruments.The instruments join Music’s impressive collection which spans from rare Baroque-period woodwinds to thousands of choral pieces from various centuries. Of course, the Vuillaume Fastovsky played as a student still resides as part of the prized Salz collection of antique violins, violas and bows donated in 1964.“I cannot tell you how inspiring it was for my playing to be able to play on such an instrument,” said Fastovsky. “Perhaps somebody can love the Louis Lot the way I loved that Vuillaume.”Fastovsky serves as Chair of the Department of Geosciences at the University of Rhode Island. He is the co-author of “Dinosaurs: A Concise History” (Cambridge University Press).-Alex CoughlinZhoushu Ziporyn Noon Concert performance in September 2016Zhoushu Ziporyn was drawn to the UC Berkeley Department of Music for a number of reasons. The open and very friendly atmosphere, a holistic academic approach, an extensive library collection, and an amazing and open-minded faculty all drew Ziporyn to UC Berkeley.“I ended up in Cal because I like what it stands for. I was intrigued by the diversity of ensemble groups offered at the music program,” noted Ziporyn.Ziporyn started his musical career early, learning the violin as a child. He later found inspiration in the works of an eclectic collection of artists: Bach, The Beatles, Bill Evans, Prokofiev and Japanese traditional Gagaku music. As Ziporyn grew older he began playing in jazz and rock bands in his high school years and frequently jammed with his friends.Since coming to Cal, Ziporyn has amassed an impressive academic and musical record. He won the 2016 Alfred Hertz Memorial Traveling Scholarship, allowing him to visit Japan and study traditional Japanese instruments, as well as learning from the masters of the Nō Theatre tradition. He also was a winner of the Department’s Nicola de Lorenzo Prize for composition in 2015-16. This semester, he opened the 2016 Fall Noon Concert series with an original solo piece for electric violin titled “The Absurdity of Now and Then.”The University Baroque Ensemble performed a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuatre qui fait plisser les yeux” by Music major Zhoushu Ziporyn at Director Davitt Moroney’s final performance at Hertz Hall before his retirement.The University Baroque Ensemble performed a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuatre qui fait plisser les yeux” by Music major Zhoushu ZiporynZiporyn is also a gifted composer. He’s penned original works such as “Gimme Some Context,” “Sleep’s Tree,” and “If Only You Were Cool” while he served as an Emerging Artist with The Sheldon Brown Quartet at the Emerald Tablet in San Francisco. He also worked collaboratively as musical artist in “Cine/Spin,” creating the music for the feature film “Valerie and Her Week of Wonders” (Jaromil Jires, 1969) at UC Berkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA). Ziporyn also authored a collection of “Poetry Fugues for Seekers” in collaboration with UC Berkeley Astronomer Alexei Filippenko and Mycologist John Taylor.Most recently Ziporyn wrote a piece titled “Une teinte de jaune bleuâtre qui fait plisser les yeux” which was premiered and performed by Director Davitt Moroney at the final University Baroque Ensemble concert before the Director’s retirement from UC Berkeley.With graduation on the horizon on spring 2017, Ziporyn plans on returning to Japan to spend a year furthering his studies with the masters in the traditional arts of Japan. As a culmination of his studies in Japan last June, he will be premiering a segment of his musical theatre, “Tomorrow’s Sound,” with the Theatre of Yūgen in San Francisco May 2017. He’s also working with a special group of musicians and actors to materialize “Star Wars Palimpsest: Luke as A Pagan Hero,” an original musical theatre work that pits the parallels between the cosmology of the Star Wars movies with the story of Abraham and Isaac in the Bible, as a kind of postmodern cantata that aims to provoke further flexibility of thought.“I honestly can’t believe that it’s already been four years. It has truly been a blast,” noted Ziporyn summing up his time at UC Berkeley. “As I face a future unknown to me about to unfold, one thing I do know is that I will always cherish my time at Cal and think back to it as a solid foundation to my future self and endeavors.”Nicholas MathewUC Berkeley Associate Professor of Music Nicholas Mathew’s schedule is pretty full most semesters. Between teaching a range of research and performance courses, maintaining a schedule of piano performances, and continuing to publish new research on late eighteenth-century music there is not much time for anything else in his professional calendar. But this year Mathew added more to his plate: a fellowship at UC Berkeley’s Townsend Center, helping to curate a series of concerts and lectures dedicated to the Mendelssohn family at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life, and designing a program of special events with the Takács Quartet, hosted by Cal Performances.“It’s been a busy year intellectually and musically,” said Mathew “but I’ve enjoyed the chance to engage the public in different ways.”Mathew has been researching across disciplines for some time, so a fellowship at the Townsend Center was a natural fit. Founded in 1987, the Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities encourages interdisciplinary scholarship, awarding fellowships annually to researchers whose academic interests traverse multiple disciplines. Mathew’s first book, Political Beethoven, was an interdisciplinary study that combined thickly textured material history and political theory alongside close music analysis. This year, his Townsend Fellowship will support a new project that focuses on music-making and commercial life in the expanding metropolitan centers of late eighteenth-century Europe, particularly with respect to the music of Beethoven’s most famous teacher, Joseph Haydn.When Cal Performances announced that the Takács Quartet would be performing the complete cycle of Beethoven quartets in Berkeley, they approached Mathew, along with the Takács’ first violinist Edward Dusinberre, to discuss how they might design new ways of engaging with these well-known works.  The first installment of this high-profile collaboration took place in October.“Ed and I already knew each other a little, because he had been completing a fantastic book about the Beethoven quartets and the compelling history of the Takács Quartet itself — so a stimulating collaboration was practically inevitable,” said Mathew.The Takács Quartet returns to Berkeley in March and April 2017, when Mathew will be joined by Mark Ferraguto (Penn State) and Mary Hunter (Bowdoin College) to talk — appropriately enough, in the Bay Area — about the “new media” of the early nineteenth century, and their consequences for Beethoven’s string quartets.So what will Mathew do to follow up his dizzying 2016-17?“Well, I’m on leave — and I hope to return waving a brand new book in the air. Fingers crossed.”Credit: Rick PeckhamAlexander Kahn graduated from UC Berkeley Music with his Ph.D. in 2008.

Club meets every other Wednesday from 4-6pm in Morrison 135.
Composers are encouraged to bring their pieces and workshop them with their peers to get feedback from players and ideas and comments from other composers.
Club email is ugcomposers@gmail.com.Anyone who is interested in playing and performing new music is welcome. The end of semester concert in Hertz Hall features many diverse styles.The club was (re)started by undergrad composer James Sharp in the Spring of 2005. He had asked a professor why there wasn’t a club for undergraduate composers to feature their original works and discovered that there had been one years before but it had died out. With the professor’s encouragement, he contacted fellow interested classmates/composers Mike McClure, Nicolas Rastegar, and James Nolan. The club had its first three concerts at noon as part of the Morrison student recital series.The first concert was not a success as there were poor performances and only about 20 audience members. Though it was rough, it was also a learning experience that taught them about concert production. The third and last noon concert was a huge success. There were 12 composers, about 30 student performers, and even 2 student conductors (for the larger ensembles). Morrison Hall Elkus Room was completely packed with students and professors lining the aisles. After the last Morrison concert, the club became very visible in the department, resulting in more resources being made available for concerts.In Fall 2006, anticipating the continued growth in audience, the club had its first evening concert in Hertz Hall. It had a superb turnout, great music, and set the standard for Undergraduate Composers Club concerts to this day. The club continues to thrive as an ever-growing body of music students composes and performs new works in a variety of styles.From 12/1/2008 concert in Hertz HallSee events calendar for more information.December 1, 2008, 8pm, Hertz Hall

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedI was born in Bucharest, Romania. My family was, as one would say, “very creative”: my mom is a visual artist, my dad had studied classical violin for ten years, my grandmother was a classically trained soprano and my great-aunt was a piano teacher. My parents and godparents took me to classical concerts since I was five, and made sure the house was always resonating with the sounds of the good ol’ classics; but I was never really around a piano. When I was seven my godmother had the idea to have me audition for the local music school, and Carmen Simu, who ended up being my first teacher, discovered what she thought was a particularly excellent ear — although she had no room for additional piano students in her studio at that time, so she suggested I check out the next-door violin studio. For whatever reason, I absolutely resisted taking that offer and demanded I still learn piano; and so it began. Driven above all, perhaps, by an ardent love of Beethoven (to whom I sent love letters in the form of paper airplanes when I was eight), I realized within the next year that I wanted to be a professional pianist. My fourth year I started more intensive studies with professor Carmen Enescu, who also taught at the Dinu Lipatti National College of Art, and in fifth grade, my parents and I moved to the United States where I began studies with Hans Boepple at Santa Clara University. By that time, I was sure that my future would center around the conservatory path; throughout middle school and high school, I worked strenuously to prepare for this and performed pieces like Chopin’s First Concerto and Prokofiev’s Second Concerto with orchestras, receiving several awards in national and international piano competitions in the process.Theodora Serbanescu Martin ’17After applying to many schools and finishing my undergraduate auditions, I had a curious experience as I weighed my options: most of the programs I’d gotten accepted into were conservatories, and just a couple were universities that I considered not necessarily back-ups — but certainly “alternatives.” Throughout middle school and high school, I also cultivated an interest in writing (anything from essays to music reviews for Peninsula Reviews), and a passion for English and Russian literature. Already by the beginning of senior year when I was looking at potential schools, I was thinking about pursuing a double major with English. In short, the reason I applied to Berkeley was because I knew the Department of English was ranked first in the country; I hadn’t really heard about the music program. But when I did receive my acceptance letter, I suddenly felt an unexpected, immovable feeling that I had to choose Berkeley; an inexplicable force drew me to the campus — which I had never even visited properly before except to hear a couple of concerts at Zellerbach. None of my family members, friends, or even I thought this would have ever been a serious choice, but for some reason, at the last minute, I felt imminent regret — that to choose a conservatory education would mean to give up my other varied intellectual interests; and I was not ready — I still had so much to learn, so much knowledge and culture to funnel into my mind and heart!

Berkeley gave me not only what I had somehow intuitively known it would, but something infinitely above what I would have ever hoped for. I’ll resist the urge to wax poetic about what a rich cultural experience even one day in Berkeley could be, but I can say that I’ve had, from the first moment on our campus, this feeling that I could only classify as “nostalgia for the present” — a heart-wrenching happiness, mixed with a determination that urged me to remind myself to enjoy every moment of it, because I would never feel this way again. (I mean, when else would I get to write poems at the Campanile at night and to smell that gentle mix of night jasmine and the drifting crispness of a San Francisco breeze?) Second semester of freshman year is when I really got involved in performance activities and started channeling my inner Hermione Granger in classes by doing “serious work” — beginning (of course) with the Beethoven course taught by the incomparable Nicholas Mathew, who encouraged me to explore the yet uncharted territory of my musical imagination, and to fulfill all my intellectual curiosities. Meeting the lovely historical keyboards in our department and learning to play them, expanding my already strong musical interests with classes such as James Davies’s Opera course and, as of lately, Prof. Roberts’s jointly taught course “Art & Activism,” becoming a part of the vivacious orchestra community as pianist in the UCBSO, sharing many beautiful lessons and musical moments with the ever-supportive, golden-hearted Martha Wasley, getting headaches from reading Adorno for my “Late Beethoven” graduate seminar, finding what I would classify as “musician soulmates” to play chamber music with, hearing free performances at Hertz and Zellerbach from ensembles like the Vienna Philharmonic and talking to some of the members first-hand, add up to only a small percentage of the array of experiences that have made my time here in Berkeley unforgettable, and my educational self-development so comprehensive and thorough. 

Some of my highlights as music major include my performance of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto and my reading of Brahms’s Second Concerto with the UCBSO and the magnificent David Milnes, my four solo noon and evening concerts, the last of which I played on our Regier fortepiano, and the exciting process of designing and teaching for two semesters my DeCal on historically informed performance. Taking the last course the legendary Richard Taruskin ever taught will always be one of my fondest memories, as will my crazy independent study on Brahms with David Pereira, hearing James Davies’s pure and glittering laugh in the Morrison hallways, convincing myself to enjoy the many all-nighters I pulled to write gigantic over-the-page-limit papers for my history courses — and, of course, immersing myself in the over-the-top process of writing my honors thesis on Brahms, which included stuff like gawking at his manuscript in the Hargrove and trying to shield the fragile 155-year old paper from my acidic tears. For this project, I have received a 2017 Charlene Conrad Liebau Library Prize for Undergraduate Research and feel very thankful to all — professors, librarians, staff, family, friends — who have helped me through this process. Additionally, I am grateful to have been one of the recipients of the 2016 Eisner Prize in the Creative Arts — an honor for which I owe infinite thanks to everyone in the Department. 

Outside of music — and the Hargrove, which has become my second home, especially those ML.410.B8’s, which I had started to claim as my own (to the detriment of my constantly overdue library card) — my endeavors as English major and German minor gave me equally rich experiences that I do not have room to write about in here. All I can say is that sometimes I felt like three people in one, trying simultaneously to wrap my head around that un-translated version of Goethe and to finally understand the Genetiv, to get through the first book of Spenser’s Faerie Queene in one weekend because I had “procrastinated” on reading it by practicing Brahms for hours, and to scramble to write most of my overflowing English honors thesis on my man Sir Thomas Wyatt and his impossibly interesting, perplexing poetry in the last two months because I had a concert every month before and I “just didn’t have time.” 

Above all, it is the wonderful souls I’ve met in Berkeley who have made my experience what it was — the brilliant, caring professors, some of whom I know will be life-long connections, the patient roommates and best friends, the fellow Music and English majors who were always excellent at commiserating, and even that guy on Sproul who always shouts about global warming and how our education is actually brainwashing rather than enlightening us. And not to forget the squirrels, of course! 

It is difficult for me to accept that I have to leave this magical place soon, but at the same time I know that my experience at Berkeley — which has fostered my process of self-understanding — has already equipped me with more independence and self-sufficiency than I already possessed intrinsically. In the fall I will be heading off to Cornell University to continue my studies of music with a Musicology PhD. Currently my most important professional goal is to cultivate a career as performing scholar — to blend equally musicology and piano performance, and to advocate for interdisciplinary work of all sorts. More specifically, I hope to become a Brahms scholar — and yes, to keep performing tons of Beethoven and, well, any and all German Romantic piano music. Whatever I do, I am confident that everything I learned and experienced at Berkeley will give me the strength and knowledge to navigate all that the mysterious future will bring. © 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Undergraduate Committee is the forum through which advocacy for change, a legacy of UC Berkeley, is channeled to the Music Department. As the chair of the committee, I work with colleagues, staff, and most importantly, our undergraduate student representatives, to hear students’ concerns and work towards solutions. We also plan special events to promote community and exchange as well as do whatever else is necessary to improve our Music Majors’ experience here.Morrison Hall houses one of the most unique departments on our campus. We are filled with young, experienced performers, yet we are not a conservatory. Furthermore, many of our students are also impressive intellectuals and pursue double major degrees. This means that students’ experience within the Music Department varies quite a bit, which can pose a challenge in terms of mentorship. As the chair of this committee, I have a special vision to address this issue, and I want to help students begin to answer questions like the following:There is much work to do, but we are continuously striving to help Music students thrive. If you are an incoming or current undergraduate student, please contact us at any time so that we can help you get the most from your experience here.Professor Ken Ueno
