          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownMCM 0110 - Theory and Analysis of Modern Culture and MediaAn introduction to critical theory, cultural studies, and media analysis that addresses print, photography, film, television, and digital media. We will examine these media in relationship to influential theoretical approaches such as structuralism and post-structuralism, ideological analysis and psychoanalysis, feminist and queer theory, critical race theory and theories of post-colonialism and globality, and media and technology studies. LILE WRIT MCM 0150 - Text/Media/Culture: Theories of Modern Culture and MediaAn introduction to the theoretical foundations of contemporary cultural criticism. We will study theories of representation, signification and culture; image and narrative; ideology and discursive power; and modernity and postmodernity. Such theories are crucial to understanding modern culture and media (including print, photographic, film, television, and digital media texts). Readings from theorists such as Saussure, Benjamin, Levi-Strauss, Derrida, Barthes, Marx, Freud, Fanon, Arendt, Foucualt, Irigary, Appadurai, and Butler. Students must register for both the lecture and one screening; a signup sheet will be available for discussion sections after the first class meeting. Open to undergraduates only. WRIT MCM0220 Print Culture: Textuality and the History of BooksThis course will introduce students to the concept of print as a mass medium with particular attention to the theoretical problematics that govern its analysis and competing concepts of print as a form. We will trace the emergence of mass literacy and habits of reading, print culture and the public sphere, the rise of the novel, and the concept of literature, and theories of representation and mediation, narrativity and virtuality, the work and the text.  MCM 0230 - Digital MediaThis course introduces students to the crtiical study of digital media: from surveillance to hactivism, from cyberpunk fiction/films to art installations, from social media to video games. We will analyze the aesthetics, politics, protocols, history and theory of digital media. Special attention will be paid to its impact on/relation to social/cultural formations, especially in terms of new media’s “wonderful creepiness,” that is, how it compromises the boundaries between the public and private, revolutionary and conventional, work and leisure, hype and reality. MCM 0240 - Television StudiesIntroduces students to the rigorous study of television, concentrating on televisual formations (texts, industry, audience) in relation to social/cultural formations (gender, generational, and family dynamics; constructions of race, class, and nation; consumerism and global economic flows). That is, this course considers both how television has been defined and how television itself defines the terms of our world. Students MUST register for the lecture section, the screening, and a conference section. Open to undergraduates only. LILE WRIT MCM 0250 - Visuality and Visual TheoriesTheories of visual representation in such traditional media as painting, in photography, and in emergent digital media (VR, robotics, etc.). Connects problems of representation to issues of power, information, subjectivity. These media are read as historically constituted and specific to particular cultures through complex forms of mediation. LILEMCM 0260 - Cinematic Coding and Narrativity Introduces students to rigorous study of the structural and ideological attributes of cinema, concentrating on the dominant narrative model developed in the American studio system and alternatives to that model. Attention to film theory in relation to questions of representation, culture, and society. Students become conversant with specific elements and operations of the cinematic apparatus (e. g. camerawork, editing, sound-image relations) and how they produce discursive meanings. Students MUST register for the lecture, section and one screening. A sign-up sheet will be available for conferences after the first class meeting. Open to undergraduates only. LILE WRIT  MCM 0700 - Introduction to the Moving ImageThe purpose of this course is to provide a basic introduction to film and video production and to begin to consider the kinds of texts that might be produced using these media. Students are expected to work in an intelligent manner, take risks with the content and form, engage in empirical research of the medium, and in so doing, examine common presumptions about media production. Students will utilize 16mm non-sync film cameras and small format video to produce a series of short projects emphasizing the creative use of these media in various social and visual arts contexts. Classes will consist of screenings and discussion of a wide variety of works, basic technical demonstrations, and critiques of student work. No previous production experience necessary.

How do digital technologies challenge conventions about art making, authorship, and audience? This production course introduces students to the practice, and critical inquiry into art in digital culture. The class will engage in contemporary debates on art and new media and will experiment with digital photography, video, and coding. Throughout the semester, students will work on a series of short projects, and a final individual or collaborative work. Artist case studies include Harun Farocki, Oliver Laric, and anonymous-memes-creators; readings include, Hito Steyerl, David Joselit, and Boris Groys. Enrollment limited to 40. LILE MCM 0750C - Soft MachinesParticipants in this production course will work with new materials and textile processes hands-on while engaging in contemporary discussions and debates on human-machine interfaces and extensions. We will design and construct soft machines wherein the components include new yarns and materials. We will explore fibers, polymers, and yarns for electrical applications, human performance, and environmental elements, among others. Body technology research areas such as motion tracking and biometric data analysis will be introduced. Throughout the semester, students will work on a series of short projects as well as a final individual or collaborative work. MCM 0760 - Intermediate Digital Media ProductionHow do technologies enabling new forms of media and communication reconfigure notions of geography, location, speed, presence, community, autonomy, public, private, and one's ability to participate in culture? This class is an exploration of how artists and other cultural producers use these new technologies and new conditions to activate networks, form communities, create access, self-publish, proliferate, draw attention to context, demand agency, redefine property, and develop spaces for exchange and play. MCM 0780 - Soundtracks: Sound Production and Visual MediaA production course that examines the role of sound in film, video, and installation forms. The listening assignments and visual media screenings will foreground the usage of audio in the works of selected artists/filmmakers. The course also considers works of sound art. Readings by sonic theorists and producers will examine the possibilities of sound production as a key register of modern social and aesthetic experience. Class members should have completed at least one time-based media class. Students are expected to be competent technically. Application required. Application is available in the MCM office. Students must bring a completed application to the first class to be considered for admission. The final class list will be determined after this meeting, with permission of the instructor. Enrollment limited to 15. S/NC. MCM 0790 - This is a Public Service AnnouncementThis course will examine the broad mission of "public service" media in its various iterations, both in commercial broadcast television, state run television, and in numerous forays by artists and collectives into public space. Students will produce a series of short video and/or installation projects that will explore critically the content and form of the Public Service Announcement and its historical precedents. In addition, the class will also collectively design, shoot, and produce, in collaboration with the RI Department of Education, their own Public Service Announcement that will air on local television stations. This will be a rare opportunity for undergraduate students not only to gain hands-on production experience, but also to think about and exhibit work outside of the University classroom context. Prerequisite: MCM 0700, MCM 0710, MCM 0720, MCM 0730, or MCM 0740.MCM 0800 - Freshman Seminars in Modern Culture and MediaMCM 0800A - Agency and RepresentationAgency is one of the most popular concepts across the disciplines today, but its definitions are often far from satisfactory in relation to representational forms such as literature and film. Using both fictional and theoretical texts, this course will examine some common assumptions about agency and develop a range of possible interpretations that will make the term viable in the study of artistic representation. For first year students only.MCM 0800B - Freshman Seminar on VisualityAn examination of the key texts (from such diverse fields as philosophy, visual arts, cultural studies) which describe the historical transformation of personal and social visual space. We will explore, for example, Renaissance and Cartesian optics, the mechanization of vision in the late nineteenth century and recent hypotheses around machine-centered visuality. For first year students only.MCM 0800C - Marx, Nietzsche, Freud: History of TheoryMany of the most pressing theoretical issues addressed by contemporary cultural analysis were first investigated in the works of these three ground-breaking intellectuals. This course will survey some of their major works, with attention to such concepts as ideology and the commodity; the will to power and truth in language; the unconscious and sexual difference. For first year students only.MCM 0800D - Sound for A Moving ImageA production/seminar. An examination of the role of sound in the works of five exemplary artists/filmmakers while we produce sound works for filmic projects. For first year students only.MCM 0800E - Race and Imagined FuturesWhy is race so important to imagining utopian or dystopian futures - to signaling world peace or Malthusian disaster? What do these imaginings tell us about contemporary anxieties over / desire for multiculturalism and globalization? This course responds to these questions by examining speculative, science and utopian fiction and films by African-, Asian- and Euro-American authors/film makers. Readings will be theoretical, as well as literary. Enrollment limited to 20. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 0800F - The Face in CinemaCinema has always been obsessed with the thematics of the human face. The close-up is most frequently associated with a revelation of intense human signification, with a rendering legible of the face as the signifier of the soul, and with the face as the privileged signifier of individuality, truth, beauty, and interiority as well as the most basic support of intersubjectivity. We will examine the face in the cinema in relation to the star system, theories of desire and affect, and a history of representation of the face (Darwin, Galton, Duchenne, etc.). Films by Dreyer, Hitchcock, Warhol, Wiseman, and others. Students must register for the primary meeting and one film screening. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYS.MCM 0800H - TV/Not TV: Theory and ProductionThis freshman seminar examines both commercial television and non-commercial media forms, considering the dialogue and/or tensions between them. What are the critical potentials and political stakes of viewing TV and of making independent media? How can we re-write TV's cultural codes by stimulating alternative readings, fostering new interpretive practices, creating different texts, or developing diverse modes and sites of distribution? Combining theory and practice (media studies, televisual and anti-televisual screenings, and simple production assignments using available technologies), this course encourages students to read and critique commercial television through both analysis and their own creative media practices. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYSMCM 0800I - Victim TestimoniesThis seminar will explore primarily first person narratives and historical and other accounts that seek to recreate victim's voices (of the Jewish Holocaust, Stalin's terror, the Algerian War, the Rwandan genocide) in order to understand the cultural contexts and narrative styles that fashion victims, shape readers' views of them, and lead us to take some more seriously than others. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYSMCM 0800J The Revolution is Being PhotographedThe course will examine the following idea: revolution is not an epoch making event but a dialect, a genre and grammar of practices and gestures. Images and moving images will be read as the "written" signs of this dialect, which document more and less known revolutionary moments. The recurrent familiar gestures repeated by the demonstrators will be studied as components of a language rather than planned actions carried out to achieve a given goal. The recurrence of the same idioms and gestures in various parts of the world requires questioning the universal and regional dimension of this language. Enrollment limited to 20 first year student. DVPS FYS LILE  MCM 0800K Pirates!This course examines the figure of the pirate and understandings of piracy from Treasure Island and Pirates of the Caribbean to Pirate Bay and the WTO–that is, from sea-faring pirates and early print culture to the Internet and "pirate modernity." What do pirates do, mean, stand for, teach us? Readings, discussions and screenings will focus on both the history of pirates and piracy as well as the contemporary (media) pirate and issues related to creativity and originality, intellectual property rights and global governance, participatory cultures and democratization, information feudalism and the pirate modernities of the Global South, enclosures and the common. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYS  MCM 0800L - "I Don't Even Know Why They Call It Color TV": Television and Race in AmericaOur era has been called both "post-televisual" and "post-racial," yet images that define and are defined by (mis)understandings of race fill our screens (whether on TV sets or other means for disseminating TV). Formations of television and race not only remain pressing concerns but are intertwined, mutually constructing one another. This course thus explores how notions of race have been mediated and how media have figured race. Topics include: stereotype analysis; race in television history; scandal and crisis; intersections of gender and sexuality; consumerism and commodification; racial representation across TV genres (comedy, drama, sports, reality TV), and new media possibilities. DPLL FYS MCM 0800M - The Terrible Century (ENGL 0150U)Interested students must register for ENGL 0150U. MCM 0900 - Undergraduate Seminars in Modern Culture and MediaTopics vary from year to year and instructor to instructor. In each section, enrollment is limited to 20. Prerequisite: one previous MCM course (MCM 0100, 0150, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, 1110 or equivalent).MCM 0900A - Cinema and Stardom: Image/Industry/FantasyFocuses on the star within the "machinery" of Hollywood cinema: how stars function in the film industry, within cinematic and extra-cinematic texts, and at the level of individual fantasy and desire. Including screenings of films which exploit, foreground, or critique star images, also considers the ideological implications and cultural consequences of stardom.MCM 0900B - Global CyberpunkExamines how cyberpunk functions both as a global phenomenon and as a way to imagine the global. Texts include American science fiction by authors such as Octavia Butler and Neal Stephenson; anime such as Akira and AD Police Force; feature films such as Blade Runner; as well as theoretical texts on globalization, science fiction, and animation.MCM 0900F - Real TVThis course will investigate the construction of reality on U.S. television, considering not only specific reality genres (news and "magazine" programs, crisis coverage, docudrama, talk and game shows) but the discursive and representational modes that define the "reality" of commercial television as a whole. Issues include: "liveness"; social relevancy"; therapeutic discourse; TV personalities; media simulation; independent television; and new technologies/realisms.MCM 0900G - Representing the InternetInvestigates popular representations of the Internet (many of which precede the WWW) from cyberpunk to Supreme Court decisions, from mainstream film to Internet map sites. Considers the relationship between representation, ideology, culture, and technology. All written work for the seminar will be digital.MCM 0901C - Photography/Film/ArtQuestions of the nature of the photographic image have come to the fore in some of the most exciting modern art, such as the work of Cindy Sherman and Andy Warhol. In particular, the question of how the photograph relates to film and history has generated important questions about art and media. This course will analyze these questions through the work of such artists as Jeff Wall, Jean-Luc Godard, and Hiroshi Sugimoto. We will examine these in relation to writings that theorize the relationship of photography to film and art after World War Two. Readings include Benjamin, Barthes, and Krauss. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 undergraduates. WRITMCM 0901D - Film ComedyWhat makes some films so funny? This course will investigate many different forms of film comedy-- from slapstick physical gags involving hapless men and umbrella-wielding matrons, to eccentric verbal banter, to parodies that subvert state politics using puppet characters. Instead of treating film comedy as “just mindless escapism,” we will study how comedy's complex and slippery devices are central to the history of cinema. Readings in critical discourses about comedy, film history and film theory, e.g. Freud, Bergson, Benjamin, Rob King, Miriam Hansen, and Kathleen Rowe. Screenings range from silent slapstick, to communist satire, to romantic comedy, to political mockumentary. Enrollment limited to 20 undergraduates. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 0901E - The Fantastic in Contemporary CinemaThis course addresses the idea of the Fantastic from its definition to its articulations in contemporary cinema. Focusing more on form than on content, we will privilege a reading of the Fantastic as an effect rather than a genre or a theme: specific attention will be given to the relationships between filmic texts, spectatorship and the production of meaning. Screenings will include popular Hollywood cinema as well as European and independent films. We will discuss works by directors such as Lynch, Nolan, Fincher, Spielberg, Gondry, Cronenberg and Haneke. Readings will range from literary theory and psychoanalysis to film theory and semiotics. Enrollment limited to 20 undergraduates. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. All others will need written permission from the instructor.MCM 0901F - "America" in Diaspora LiteraturesHow have diasporic and immigrant writers come to see the United States? How do these writers negotiate dominant understandings of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, and language that come to define "the nation"? Is all immigrant/minority writing necessarily (auto)biographical? How are notions of history, memory, and futurity taken up by writers of diasporic and hybrid cultures in the US? These are some of the questions that this course will take up through a close reading of canonical and contemporary African-American, South/Asian-American, and Arab-American texts. This course is ideal for students interested in minority literatures, diaspora studies, and Ethnic Studies.MCM 0901G - Digital Culture and Art After 1989How can we contextualize new media art alongside earlier forms of media such as photography and cinema? Is its relation to the "outside world" primarily conceived as representation, or as process? What are the cultural effects of this mediatic shift? Taking as our starting point the fall of the Berlin Wall and the resulting spread of capitalism as a near-global political-economic system, we will "read" a variety of works of art and culture from several contemporary theoretical perspectives. Topics include digital media, the Internet, European cinema, and popular music. Readings from Galloway, Fukuyama, Deleuze, Hardt and Negri, Freud, Jameson, etc. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. LILE MCM 0901H - Uncomfortable MediaWhy are we often addicted to that which disgusts us? This course analyzes why "uncomfortable media" – media that plays with notions of the perverse, the abject, and the taboo – remain so popular in the American cultural imaginary. Studying a variety of popular television programs and films, this course will approach these viscerally transgressive media texts through analyzing representation (how cultural taboos appear in popular culture) and analyzing spectatorship (how viewers perform discomfort). We will examine how developments in genre and narrative form, affect studies, performance studies, and queer theory have contributed to theorizing the perverse. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. DVPS LILEMCM 0901I Body Count: Technologies of Life and DeathFrom the War on Terror and the global obesity crisis to self-help reality TV and new biotechnologies, questions of life and death have come to center stage of contemporary politics. This course investigates the theoretical and historical contexts under which "life itself" has emerged as a key arena of social, cultural, and technological importance. We will read critical studies of race, media, embodiment, and the state, tracing how distinctions between life and its others have structured the distribution of death, risk, and freedom in modernity. Topics include biocolonialism, cyborgs and swarms, U.S. prison regime, computer viruses, "bugchasing," suicide bombing. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. DVPS LILEMCM 0901J Adaptation Culture: New Media<---> Traditional Theatres (TAPS 0080)  Interested students must register for TAPS 0080. MCM0901K Statelessness and Global Media: Citizens, Foreigners, AliensWhat is citizenship? What does it mean to be granted or refused state protection within the global system? To better understand how nation-states govern subjects, we will consider the condition of refugees, displaced persons, illegal residents, undocumented aliens, and stateless persons. We will read the representations of non-citizenship in global media texts (humanitarian graphic narrative, migrant diary, atrocity photography, world cinema, war fiction, crowdsourced crisis mapping). This course will place a special emphasis on how perpetual warfare, territorial re-mappings, and nationality legislation continue to generate sliding scales of non-citizenship. Readings include Arendt, Balibar, Chatterjee, Foucault, Lowe, and Said. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20.  MCM 0901L African American Media Visibility: Image, Culture, CrisisThis course explores the "problem" of the black image in 20th - 21st century U.S. film and television. What is the role of spectacle and scandal in (re)presenting blackness to the public? Emphasis placed on the tension between invisibility and (hyper)visibility of the black subject in relation to gender and sexuality as well as the political, ethical, social, and psychical implications of such varying degrees of visual exposure. Topics include the aesthetics of black celebrity from Josephine Baker to Beyoncé, cinematic practices from filmmakers Spike Lee to Tyler Perry, and televisual blackness from The Cosby Show to Flavor of Love. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0220, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. MCM 0901M Ishiguro, Amongst Others  (ENGL 0710L)Interested students must register for ENGL 0710L. MCM 0901N Body/Gesture/Cinema Antonin Artaud once called the body “a language to which it seems we no longer have the key.” This course is an attempt to take up his challenge in light of our experience at the cinema. Two questions will guide our investigation: Do the bodies on film “signify”? If so, how does this signifying practice trigger our own corporeal unconscious? We will explore a wide range of texts across film studies, theatre, anthropology, linguistics, and critical theory. Topics include gesture, ethnography, disability, violence, horror, and phenomenology. Readings include Didi-Huberman, Benjamin, Ricoeur, Merleau-Ponty, Kristeva, Shaviro, Sobchack, Naremore, Clover, Linda Williams, etc. MCM 0901O Reinventions of Life: Aesthetics, Biopolitics, and the Avant-GardesThe impulse to connect art with life runs through the avant-gardes of the early and mid-twentieth century. Yet recently, the question of what constitutes life itself has emerged with increasing persistence. In this course, we will reconsider the history of the avant-gardes – and avant-garde cinema particularly – in relation to this question. Drawing broadly on theories of how contemporary forms of life have been managed and made productive, we will explore the links between the avant-garde’s aesthetic and political practices and its ongoing efforts to redefine and reinvent social existence. Readings include Benjamin, Foucault, Lacan, Fanon, Debord, Mulvey, and Agamben. MCM 0901P After the War: Arendt, Duras and Anonymous from Berlin  (COLT 0710Y)Interested students must register for COLT 0710Y.MCM 0901Q - Governing Sex: Citizenship, Violence, MediaFrom the photographs of Abu Ghraib, to Tyler Clementi's suicide, and the rise of “revenge porn,” contemporary media have been central to understanding the ways in which sexuality, law, and citizenship are negotiated in our present moment. This course will take these moments of public crisis as instances from which to understand the politics of belonging within the framework of the contemporary nation-state. We will examine the inter-related problematics of sexuality as a site of state governance, and the anxieties about sexual violence as national crises. Assigned readings will include queer of color critique, critical race theory, feminism, and postcolonialism. MCM 0901R - Altered Cinema: The Cultural Politics of Film RevisionRepetition and variation define contemporary cinema texts. Media producers create multiple “cuts” of the same picture for domestic/international theater, television and home video markets. Meanwhile, consumers use new technologies to create their own textual variations and share them using informal distribution channels. This is a primary concern of Altered Cinema, which examines the history and culture of film revision from multiple perspectives, including originality, authorship, censorship, globalization, preservation, translation, copyright, fandom, new media and piracy. Screenings compare and contrast different editions, including director and fan cuts, of Metropolis, Star Wars, Dune and Night Watch among others. MCM 0901S - Mediating Reproduction: Feminism, Art, ActivismHow have feminist artists and activists imagined and transformed the politics of reproduction? This course explores the complex meanings of “reproduction” across media, performance, and public culture, with a focus on questions of sexuality, race, labor, and aesthetic practice. Situating reproduction in an expanded frame, we will consider the relationship between biological reproduction and the gendered labor of reproducing social life (e.g., domestic labor, sex work, care work). Throughout, we will pay special attention to the entanglements of artistic labor with women's reproductive labor. Topics include: eugenics, housework/welfare activism, art workers movements, biotechnologies, queer kinship, and feminist utopias. MCM 0901T - Shakespeare: The Screenplays (ENGL 0310E)Interested students must register for ENGL 0310E. MCM 0901U - What is Colonialism - Archives, Texts and Images (COLT 0812B)Interested students must register for COLT 0812B. MCM 0901W - The Space Within: Contemporary Borderland Moving Image PracticeIn this course we will examine post-NAFTA moving images that take as their subject the culture and politics of the Mexico-US Borderlands. We will tackle problems such as globalization, neoliberalism, the drug war, securitization, migration, biopolitics, and femicide. To make our claims we will place importance on film form as we unpack how the films figure and/or represent the bodies and spaces of the Borderlands. More, we will think seriously about how the concepts we adopt—including that of “border” itself—function as epistemological tools. This will be a course for those invested in Borderland issues and political moving image practice.MCM 0901X - Digital Cinema and the Inhuman From the incursions of biopolitics to the specter of ecological collapse, the problem of how life is organized, sustained, and functionalized strikes at the heart of contemporary society. And yet to whom or what “life” belongs remains an open and evolving question. This course examines contemporary digital cinema as a textual, technological, and political site to rethink the concept of “the human.” Drawing on theoretical traditions that investigate the nature of vitality, automation, and the distinction between human and nonhuman, we will study how bodies, identities, and categories of thought are troubled and transformed by moving images. MCM 0901Y - Puzzle FilmsInterested students must register for MES 0950. MCM 0902B - Film Classics: Greeks on the Silver Screen (MGRK 0810) Interested students must register for MGRK 0810.MCM 0902C - Digital Media in the Time of Ecological CrisisIn a time characterized by anthropogenic climate change, militaries forecast climate refugees, scientific communities broadcast the end of ‘nature’ while politicians engineer influence in a media ecosystem. What are the politics of how media represents science, the environment and ecological crisis? This course considers the historical emergence of digital media alongside ecology. By studying the exchange between scientific knowledge, digital technology and the communication of environmental crises at local and global scales, we will attempt to establish an interpretive framework for the matrix of politics, power, inequality and violence that accompanies the historical and temporal conditions consistent with climate change. DPLL MCM 0902D - The Visual Culture of SufferingThis seminar explores how suffering is constructed as a visual phenomenon. Through close analysis of photographs, films, monuments, and exhibitions, we will explore how suffering has been deployed, and the sort of meanings it has been assigned. We will examine four specific scenes of historical suffering: Lynching and Reconstruction, The Holocaust, Hiroshima, and 9/11. DPLL MCM 0902E - In Design: Layouts of Modern Media and DesignThis course aims to engage with media and design by thinking critically about them and asking questions about their relationship to the larger culture. We will survey design elements and principles and show how they construct products and media. Beginning from the basics, we will move onto systems to demonstrate how they lay out the rules of design. We will then move to digital media in which the design elements are re-organized by new uses of old principles and inventions of new ones. Readings include: Ranciere, Latour, Flusser, Bloch, and Baudrillard, alongside with Lupton, Buchanan, Papanek, Dunne and Raby. WRIT MCM 0902F - Post Cinema? Histories and Politics in the “Digital Revolution”The rapid influx of digital technology and so-called “new media” around the new millennium has led some to suggest that Cinema—conceived of as a photochemical technology experienced publicly as a mid-twentieth century cultural phenomenon—is dead or dying. This course explores the political and historical stakes of this claim, taking an archaeological and genealogical approach to problematize notions of technological progress and periodization. Rather than seeking to “rescue” cinema, we will instead explore how “the cinematic” has been adopted and dismantled by the logics of neoliberal governmentality, and what it can still offer for modes of political resistance. MCM 1110 - The Theory of the SignA survey of three late twentieth-century theorists: Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. Our analyses will focus on these figures as they emerge from and reorient the broad field of semiotics, with particular attention to the evolution of each oeuvre, the continuities and discontinuities that distinguish their theoretical claims, and their diverging legacies. Readings will include Althusser's Reading Capital and "Contradiction and Over-determination;" Derrida’s Of Grammatology and Spurs; and Foucault's This is Not a Pipe and History of Sexuality. Critical concepts to be examined include signification, reading, discourse, subjectivity, power, historicism, archaeology, the supplement, and difference. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, or 0260. MCM 1200 - Special Topics in Modern Culture and MediaTopics vary from year to year and instructor to instructor. In each section, enrollment is limited to 50. Written permission given after the first meeting. Prerequisite: one previous Modern Culture and Media course.MCM 1200D - African CinemaSubsaharan African cinemas 1960-present, primary emphasis on narrative films. We will analyze cultural and aesthetic strategies, (cinematic style, narrative, and subjects). in the context of postcolonial African and international film histories. Themes include: anticolonial resistance/nationalist ideologies; third cinema/international art cinemas; oral aesthetic culture and cinematic style; political critique (e.g., gender, state politics); media globalizationand resistence; the struggle for a mass audience. Enrollment limited to 50. Previous coursework in MCM, Africana Studies, or related areas highly recommended.MCM 1200G - Cinema and Stardom: Image/Industry/FantasyThis course focuses on the role of the star within the "machinery" of Hollywood: how stars function in the film industry, within cinematic and extra-cinematic texts, and at the level of individual fantasy and desire. The paradoxes posed by stars--represented as like yet unlike us, public yet privately known, commodities yet (super)human--suggest complex formations and implications of the star system. We will read film theories and histories and investigate films in which star images are foregrounded to explore these issues. MCM 1200K - Hollywood as Global CinemaCommonly treated as a U.S. national cinema, Hollywood film has long been a global institution dominating worldwide distribution. We reread U.S. narrative filmmaking and its products in relation to its global ambitions. Topics include: internationalizing the history of U.S. cinema; rethinking theories of the classical and anticlassical text; local, national and global spectatorship; concepts of cultural imperialism and cultural globalization; etc. Students interested in the class who have not fulfilled the prerequisite may apply to the instructor for permission to enroll. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50.

Considers phenomena such as webcams, face recognition technology and networked art, as well as concepts such as enlightenment, paranoia and exhibitionism. Theoretical, historical and legal readings.MCM 1201C - Imagined Networks, Glocal ConnectionsThis course examines emergent "imagined networks" (Arab Spring activists, global anti-globalization networks, global climate and financial systems) impacted by new media technologies and applications. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the changing relationship between the local and the global, and how "glocal" phenomena affect national and personal identities. Readings will be theoretical, historical, political and literary. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. MCM 1201E - Feminist Theory and the Question of Sexual Subjectivity Many contemporary theories of sexual subjectivity have to do not with the body but with gender. Gender is seen to have liberated people from the dictates of biology. But there are other feminist theories that see sexual subjectivity as reducible neither to anatomy (biologically male/female) nor to gender (culturally male/female/other). We'll look at current debates among theorists and will ask what these debates have to do with the canonical work of earlier feminist film theorists on questions of spectatorship. Readings include Butler, Copjec, Freud, Lacan, Irigaray, Kristeva, Mulvey, Doane, and others. Prerequisites: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.

Alongside the globalized military conflicts of the past 100 years is a corresponding globalization of visual media technologies. This course is a study of the links between the technologies, strategies, tactics and technologies of the military and those of various media industries. Topics include "target markets"; flight simulators; Google Earth; "the logistics of military perception;" the bombing of television and radio stations in Serbia and Iraq; the global presence of U.S. military bases and their role in the Americanization of global culture; and Michael Bay's Pentagon contracts.

In short, this course seeks to put his work in the context of ideas he meant to challenge and how those challenges have been met and incorporated in current thought about politics, society, and culture. We will follow Foucault's trajectory from what he termed "archaeology" to "geneaology." Prerequisites: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260 or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors.MCM 1201Z - On Being Bored (ENGL 1511L)Interested students must register for ENGL 1511L S01.MCM 1202A - The Poetics of Confession (ENGL 1561J)Interested students must register for ENGL 1561J S01 (CRN 26582).MCM 1202B - Literature and Politics (ENGL 1900D)Interested students must register for ENGL 1900D S01 (CRN 26519).MCM 1202C - Camera Works: The Theory and Fiction of Photography (ENGL 1900V) Interested students must register for ENGL 1900V S01 (CRN 26589).MCM 1202D - China Through the Lens: History, Cinema and Critical Discourse (EAST 1270) Interested students must register for EAST 1270 S01 (CRN 16635).MCM 1202E - Extreme Asian Cinema: Contemporary Genre Cinemas in an East Asian ContextSince the late 1990's, a discourse of "extreme Asian cinema" has gained traction among aficionados of global cinema, transforming our understandings of "national cinema." In this course, we will interrogate the spectacular aesthetics of "extremity," with its violence, polymorphous perversion, and grotesquerie, in relation to social and cultural phenomena in contemporary East Asia. By analyzing the genres of the gangster film, the revival of wuxia (heroic martial arts genre) and samurai films, horror, revenge films, and techno-dystopia and ecological disaster anime, we will explore "extreme Asian cinema," as a response to cultural shifts in global identities and film experience. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors.MCM 1202F - Science Fiction CinemaAlthough it raises compelling philosophical, aesthetic, and socio-historical questions, science fiction cinema has been underrepresented in scholarly literature and the academic curriculum. This course surveys the modern science fiction film from experiments in the silent era through the contemporary science fiction blockbuster (with particular emphasis on the latter). Covers various thematic concerns (disaster, post-apocalypse, the future, simulation, space travel and inhabitation, future cities, alien arrivals/invasions, posthumanity) and is international in scope. Films by Kubrick, Cameron, Scott, Verhoeven, Gilliam, Bigelow, Boyle, Emmerich, and others. Readings in theory, philosophy, cultural studies, film studies, gender studies, and fiction.

Further, we will ask what forms of sociality or intersubjective relations these differing modes of violence posit or problematize, to gain insight into broader questions concerning the anti-sociality of violence and the prevalence of film violence in the social, cultural, and historical contexts of contemporary East Asia. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. MCM 1202J Faking Globalization: Media, Piracy, UrbanismThis course explores issues related to media, piracy, and development—centering on two entangled processes: faking and globalization. It asks: how do we understand globalization? And what does it mean to fake, forge or fail at it? We will examine theories of globalization and global media as well as challenges to dominant models of neoliberal modernity. Key examples include "pirate modernity," "information feudalism," parasites, terrorists, copycats and other markers of excess or imitation. Rather than dismissing alternative or counter-globalization practices as aberrations, the course examines how faking globalization enables both new forms of control and capacities in political society. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. MCM 1202K - Garibaldi Panorama: the Invention of a Hero (from pre-cinema to digital) (ITAL 1340) Interested students must register for ITAL 1340 S01 (CRN 14460). MCM 1202L - The Many Faces of Casanova (ITAL 1400J) Interested students must register for ITAL 1400J S01 (CRN 23869). MCM 1202M Issues in Contemporary Hollywood CinemaHow can we begin to think about contemporary Hollywood? This course examines Hollywood filmmaking from the end of the studio era through the present. It interrogates the concept of "classical Hollywood cinema" as it persists, develops, and/or attenuates outside of its natural habitat under the studio monopolies, addressing topics and areas like genre revisionism, New Hollywood, technological development, postmodernity/simulation, digitization, corporatization, merchandising, globalization, Vietnam, counterculture, Reaganism, 9/11, etc. Films by the likes of Sirk, Fuller, Hitchcock, Peckinpah, Kubrick, Scorsese, Coppola, Cassavetes, Polanski, Malick, Spielberg/Lucas, Carpenter, Bigelow, Cameron, Scott, Verhoeven, Lynch, Nolan, Peter Jackson, Jonze, P.T.

Is there political potential in the trend toward computerization? Or might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We’ll study the legitimizing rhetorics of our increasingly digital present, and read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural theory spanning the past half century. Historically arrayed, our topics range from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0220, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  MCM 1202S Click here to Continue: Bodies, Identities and Practices in a Digital AgeWhy is the notion of ‘post-racial’ synonymous with this digital age? How are political and social effects visible not only in the practice of digital technology, but in the underlying structure itself? Crossing the fields of digital humanities, critical theory, feminist theory, race studies, and new media studies, this course considers how technology is a constant reflection of fantasies and fears. We will consider the interplay between users, humans, bodies, avatars, code and systems as we simultaneously practice and critique the prevalent forms of digital technology in our lives today. Readings include work by Nakamura, Gonzalez, Haraway and Coleman. MCM 1202T Perverse Cinema (ENGL 1762A)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762A. MCM1202U Sex and Sexuality in American FilmWhat is the connection between “sex” and “sexuality,” and how do these terms intersect in film and theory? In this course, we take a long historical view of both mainstream and experimental American film. We look at how sex and sexuality have been depicted on screen, while exploring cinema’s role in the construction of diverse, often radical, identities and practices. We test a range of critical approaches—deconstruction, feminism, close reading, queer historiography—to the theory of sexuality, and read major figures in film from Greta Garbo, Orson Welles, and Rock Hudson to Lizzie Borden, Divine, and the Brokeback cowboys.  MCM 1202X Twentieth-Century Western Theatre and Performance (TAPS 1250)Interested students must register for TAPS 1250. MCM 1202Y World Cinema in a Global Context (ITAL 1029)Interested students must register for ITAL  1029.  MCM 1202Z Native American sin the Media: Representation and Self-Representation on Film (ETHN 1890G)Interested students must register for ETHN 1890G. MCM 1203A Gaming of the Oppressed: Theory and DesignThis course gives an overview of various types of “serious games” or “anti-oppressive games” that range from videogames to immersive transmedia storytelling games. We will explore issues of why gaming is so enticing and the potential games have through their history, procedure, and design. We will then examine the role games play in our everyday lives and games’ potential for understanding motivation, education, and labor. Students will also work with complimentary theories of race formation, queer theory, and gender identity. At the end of the semester, students have the opportunity to create their own game.  MCM 1203B Politics + Aesthetics of HollywoodHollywood is an industry, a cultural bellwether, and a globally distributed artform. This course will consider these functions together, asking how Hollywood’s aesthetics connect to its ideology and commerce. Focusing on the post-studio life of Hollywood, and on Hollywood’s preoccupation with sex and violence, we’ll pay special attention to the genres of melodrama and crime film, 1945-2000. We’ll read film theory, “Hollywood novels,” and documents of film culture, and watch films by filmmakers who were central to the industry (like Hitchcock and Minnelli) as well as by those at its margins (from Lupino and Waters to Burnett and Cronenberg).  MCM 1203C Tv Time Machine: History, Represenation and PoliticsHow does television both document and represent historical events? This course examines American history “as seen on TV”: how viewers watch noteworthy events live; how television archives crucial moments and time periods; and how genres such as the news, period drama and sitcom, and reality TV differ in their representations. We consider what makes television a unique medium for which to study history, particularly focusing on questions of gender, class, race, and sexuality. Utilizing approaches including the study of collective memory, historiography, aesthetic and textual analysis, and media theory, we will assess the imbrication of American history and popular culture.  MCM 1203D Back to the Future: Nostalgia and Futurity in Contemporary Sci-Fi TV and TelefantasyHow do contemporary science fiction and fantasy television programs not only imagine our future, but also our past? How do visions of the future from the past inform both of these genres today? And what does contemporary TV’s nostalgic longing for futures past suggest about where the medium is headed? This course addresses these and other related questions while providing students with an overview of contemporary English-language sci-fi and fantasy television. The course combines elements of both the lecture and seminar, and will included screenings of such varied programs as Babylon 5, True Blood, and Dr. Who.  MCM 1203E Intellectural Life and Culture in the Post-Western WorldNo one alive today has experience of a world in which the United States is not the leading economic power. This is the world we shall all encounter, however, very soon. Such headlines are small indices of an emerging post-Western future. We will investigate the intellectual, political and aesthetic culture of this future. What will change when Judaeo-Christian societies no longer monopolize global conversation? When societies that have historically rejected Western capitalism come to dominate it? What new ideas will be unleashed in such a world, and what will their consequences be for our thinking about politics, economy and identity? This is a half-credit course.  MCM 1500 - Senior Seminars in Modern Culture and MediaPreference given to seniors in any of the MCM concentrations. In each section, enrollment is limited to 20.

Theoretical and historical readings. Class hours include viewing time.MCM 1500X - Middlemarch and the SopranosThe world of The Sopranos has been called "a postmodern Middlemarch, whose inhabitants' moral and spiritual development (or devolution) unfolds within a parochial social milieu." This course offers a comparative analysis of Eliot's 1871-72 novel and HBO's (continuing) television drama, juxtaposing these two very popular, very powerful serializations in formal, thematic, ideological and narrative terms.MCM 1501B - Nation and Identity: The Concept of National CinemaComparative study of constructions of nationhood in films and written texts about cinema. Interrogation of the discursive, political and epistemological power achieved by different version of the concept "national cinema" and the kinds of collective identities they imagine, from early cinema to globalized media. Readings by theorists, historians and filmmakers. Screenings from pertinent contexts (e.g. Weimar Germany, U.S. classical cinema, Japanese 1930s, third cinema, New German Cinema, New Chinese cinema, multinational corporate cinema, etc.)MCM 1501C - National Cultures/Global Media SpheresContemporary cultural practices and media processes are often described as being implicated in "globalization," but this is a linkage that may well predate the present. This course examines theoretical, historical, and critical texts that conceive of media culture through notions of globalization, with attention to the status of nation and cultural identity in a transnational context.MCM 1501I - Reading MarxWhat is it to read Marx now? We will begin with a group of key texts written by Marx drawn from different points in his development, including the first volume of Capital. We will study influential later reinterpretations and commentaries on Marx that argue for his contemporary importance (e.g., Althusser, Balibar, Benjamin, J. Butler, Derrida, Haraway, Hardt, Negri, Zizek, etc.MCM 1501K - Seeing Queerly: Queer Theory, Film, VideoWhile cinema has typically circumscribed vision along (hetero) sexually normative lines, can film also empower viewers to see "queerly"? How do we, as sexual subjects (gay and straight), "look" in the cinema, in both senses of the word? How have sexual desires been portrayed across film history, and how might audiences wield the look, appropriating or creating imagery with which to (re)formulate subjectivity and sexuality? This course addresses such questions as it considers both "mainstream" and "alternative" productions. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening. MCM 1501N - Television Time and SpaceExplores television's temporal and spatial construction, considering how television demarcates time (regulating it through flow and segmentation, articulating work and leisure times, marking familial and national events, encouraging rhythms of reception) and space (mapping public and private space, defining a "global media culture" through local viewings, representing and enacting travel and exchange, creating imaginary geographies and communities).MCM 1501O - Television, Gender, and SexualityThis course investigates how television produces and reproduces constructions of gender and sexuality through its institutional form (as it maps relations between the public and the private, the domestic and the social, the inside and the outside), narrative patterns (as it circulates family romances, links gender and genre, and mediates sexual and social tensions), and spectatorial relations (as it variously addresses viewers as sexed and gendered subjects, consumers and commodities, familial and defamiliarized viewers). DPLL MCM 1501Q - The Close-Up: Theory and PracticeAn examination of the use of the close-up in film and theory, from the "primitive" cinema to IMAX and from Münsterberg to Aumont and Deleuze. Special attention to the way in which the close-up has been associated insistently with the face and its heightened cultural significance, with the advent of a "cinematic language," and with questions of cinematic space and scale.MCM 1501W - The Rhetoric of New MediaAn examination of contemporary theories and practices of "new media," but in particular cyberspace; investigates the ways in which information technologies are challenging our inherited ideas about knowledge and ethics. All written work for the seminar will be digital. Application required. Occasional screenings to be announced during semester.MCM 1502B - Publicity and SurveillanceInvestigates the converging technologies and practices of publicity and surveillance. Considers phenomena such as webcams, face recognition technology and networked art, as well as concepts such as enlightenment, paranoia and exhibitionism. Theoretical, historical and legal readings.MCM 1502C - Race And/As SpectacleTheoretical and historical examination of race and/as spectacle, from 19th century world fairs and exhibitions to 20th century media events. Focuses on the productive relationship between race and media, from early cinema to the Internet.MCM 1502E - Theories of the Photographic ImageExamines the history of attempts to assimilate the photographic image to a theory of representation. Will analyze theories of photography, chronophotography, film with respect to issues of time, subjectivity, historicity, the archive. Will also address the rise of the digital image and its potential threat to photography. Readings in Kracauer, Benjamin, Bourdieu, Barthes, Batchen, Marey, Bazin, Aumont and others.MCM 1502H - Information, Discourse, NetworksExamines the historical emergence of information in relation to language and networks more broadly defined. Some key issues: the rise of new media, cyborgs and other post-human beings, the intersections between post-structuralism and cybernetics and between computer and human languages, and networked multitudes. Readings from Friedrich Kitler, Jacques Derrida, Norbert Wiener, Williams Burroughs, Felix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the lab.MCM 1502J - Race as ArchiveExamination of the importance of race to the logic and practice of biological, technological and cultural archives. Engaging the similarities and differences between the categorization of race in these fields, the course will focus on race as a justification for archives more broadly, and race as an archival trace "evidence" of a biological or cultural history. Readings will be theoretical, historical and literary. Preferences given to students in Modern Culture and Media, Art-Semiotics, Modern Culture and Media- German, Modern Culture and Media-Italian, Semiotics-French, Ethnic Studies, and Science & Technology Studies. All others seek permission from the instructor.MCM 1502K - Real TVHow does television bring "real" events to us? How do we know what's "real"? What kinds of "realities" exist on television, and how do they operate (in relationship to one another, to TV fantasy, and to our everyday lives)? This course will consider not only some specific "reality genres" (news, catastrophe coverage, "surveillance programming," documentary and docudrama, talk and game shows, reality series and "docu-soaps") but the representational modes that define the reality of commercial television as a whole. Issues to be addressed include: TV "liveness," crisis and scandal, therapeutic discourses, "surveillance society," media simulation, realism and anti-realism, civic and commercial discourses, and television's construction of history and knowledge.

We will examine the discursive, political and epistemological power achieved by different versions of the concept of "national cinema" and the kinds of collective identities they imagine, from early cinema to current globalized media. Readings by theorists, historians and filmmakers. Screenings from pertinent contexts (for example, Weimar Germany, U.S. classical cinema, Japanese 1930s, third cinema, New German Cinema, New Chinese cinema, multinational corporate cinema, etc).

Primarily for MCM senior concentrators and MCM graduate students; other qualified students must obtain permission from the instructor.MCM 1502U - Media and Memory: Representing the HolocaustThe Holocaust has been described as unimaginable, at the limits of representation. Yet there have been numerous attempts to imagine and represent it, across media (film, television, graphic novels), genres (documentary, melodrama, comedy, fantasy), and modalities (through history and memory, "high" and "low" culture, fiction and nonfiction, reporting and marketing). Considering such attempts to represent the unrepresentable and "mediate" the immediacy of trauma, this course will explore media texts and theoretical/philosophical reflections on the Holocaust. Enrollment limited to 20. Prerequisite: one of the following: MCM 0110, MCM 0230, MCM 0240, MCM 0250, MCM 0260, MCM 1110. Preferences given to juniors, seniors, and graduate students. All others seek permission from the instructor.MCM 1502V - Theories of the Body and the Limits of ConstructionismScholars currently argue that cultural constructionism went too far, that theories of subjectivity that dominated the academy for over two decades neglected the materiality of the body. We will examine these criticisms as well as what it means to theorize the body. Readings include Merleau-Ponty (phenomenology), Freud and Dolto (psychoanalysis), Damasio (neurology), Fausto-Sterling (biology), Butler, Grosz, Kirby, Moore, Wilson, etc. Enrollment limited to 20. Prerequisite: one related MCM course.MCM 1502X - Race and/as TechnologyThis course asks: to what extent can race be considered a technology? That is, not an identity that is true or false, but rather a technique that one uses, even as one is used by it? Ranging from contemporary cyborgs to early 20th century eugenics, it investigates what race does, regardless of what we think it is. Readings will be theoretical, historical and literary. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. All other seek permission from the instructor. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 1502Y - Simulation Speed Implosion: Theories of Media TechnologyJean Baudrillard and Paul Virilio are generally regarded as two of media studies most notorious pessimists and hyperbolists. Yet they are also theorists who treat the media as technological systems that transcend the traditionally held boundaries of the cultural, economic, social and political. This course will place Baudrillard and Virilio in a context of media theory and technology studies rooted in the work of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan while demonstrating important differences between these figures. We will engage in close readings of Baudrillard's and Virilio's major works as well as some of the writings of their interlocutors. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 1502Z - Art Cinema and Its LegacyArt cinema is associated with directors who achieved international prominence after World War II, with unconventional narrative films that were understood as expressions of original artistic subjectivities and film movements like the French New Wave (e.g., Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini, Godard, Resnais, and many others). Art cinema defined how many imagined non-Hollywood cinema in a global context, but was neither avant-garde nor necessarily political. Its legacy persists to the present, for example, in the reception of recent Iranian cinema and New Taiwanese cinema. We will study its aesthetic and textual strategies, its significance in global film history, and its theoretical implications. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors, and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 1503A - The Ethics of Romanticism (ENGL 1560Y)Interested students must register for ENGL 1560Y S01.MCM 1503B - Jane Austen and George Eliot (ENGL 1560A)Interested students must register for ENGL 1560A S01.MCM 1503C - "Terrible Beauty": Literature and the Terrorist Imaginary (ENGL 1760I) Interested students must register for ENGL 1760I S01.MCM 1503D - W. G. Sebald and Some Interlocutors (ENGL 1761Q)Interested students must register for ENGL 1761Q S01 (CRN 26515).MCM 1503E - Aesthetic Theory/Cultural StudiesAesthetic thought has a long and varied history, but aesthetic categories have only recently become a central concern of cultural studies. This course combines readings in the history of aesthetics and aesthetic education; twentieth-century work on aesthetics from various philosophical and disciplinary perspectives (from “aesthetic theory” and the “anti-aesthetic” to “a return to aesthetics”); and recent scholarship addressing (while not necessarily celebrating) the reemergence of aesthetic questions in cultural and media studies and the evolving relationship of the aesthetic to categories such as ideology, form and virtuality. Readings from Schiller and Kant to Adorno, Berube, Foster, Galloway, Ranciere and Spivak. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.

Readings include historians, critical and legal theorists, and journalists. We will also explore recent debates around images of suffering and the reemergence of "shame" as a topic in the context of combatting violence and asserting identity in queer theory. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission.MCM 1503H - Literature and the Ideology of the Aesthetic (ENGL 1950B) Interested students must register for ENGL 1950B S01 (CRN 26963).MCM 1503I - Digital Media and Race: Ethnicity, Technicity, EmbodimentAre we becoming post-racial in the digital age? This course questions what constitutes "race" through exploration of the ways technology affects identity. Turning to examples from new media art, World of Warcraft, cyborgs and cyberculture, the role of race in the "natural" body, and the formation of identity in online communities, we will explore the relationship between race and digital media. We draw upon critical race theory, critical theories of new media and technology, postcolonial theory and posthumanism to provide a clear and nuanced understanding of race and identity, situating it within the digital culture of our increasingly virtual world. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.MCM 1503J - Film Authors and AuthorshipWho is the "author" of a film? Drawing on readings about authorship from literary theory, semiotics, poststructuralism and film studies, and close attention tofilms by major American and international directors (e.g. Hitchcock, Welles, Mizoguchi, Antonioni, Tarkovsky, Godard, Akerman, Jodorowsky, Deren, Brakhage, Malick, Scorsese, Lynch, Kiarostami, Aronofsky, Nolan, Bigelow), this course examines theories and practices of film authorship and the historical development of the idea of film directors as authors within film criticism and theory. Film authorship will also be considered in relation to other formations such as genre, national cinema, gender, race, coloniality, etc. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503K - Memory and Modern Media: Permanence and Presence in Film and Digital MediaFilm and digital media, often claim to remember or preserve our experiences. But what does it mean to capture, catalogue and archive experiences by such media? How are mediated memories encoded within a larger cultural order? How do these media make fleeting moments permanent, lend an air of truth to the image, compose an archive of experiences? We will study key examples in photography, experimental and mainstream cinema, video art, and new media, which engage with memory and visuality. Readings include key critics and theorists concerned with these issues. Screenings will include Marey, Brakhage, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, Frampton, and Marker. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503L - South Korean Cinema: From Golden Age to Korean Wave (EAST 1950U) Interested students must register for EAST 1950U S01 (CRN 27437).MCM 1503M - Outside MediaMedia technologies (e.g. film, television, digital) are often understood in relation to a rather limited set of locations, meanings, and practices. For instance, we generally take for granted that films are exhibited in movie theaters and TV in the home. Beyond such routine sites, this course examines the import of anthropological and spatial approaches to media and media theory. Focus on non-domestic media, intermediality, and contexts outside the cultural center (e.g. subaltern, non-western). Readings draw on anthropology, cultural geography, social theory, and media/cultural studies. Students will also develop media ethnographic projects utilizing video, photography, sound recording, etc. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503N Video TheoryThis course takes as its starting point Sean Cubitt's assertion in the early 1990s that there is not and never will be "video theory"—an assertion tethered to video's perceived lack of a single or essential form. Focus on the history and theory of video across "old" and "new" media, including sound and image reproduction, broadcasting, video art, documentary, gaming, digital culture, and the internet. We will consider various theoretical understandings of video and their relation to production/distribution/ exhibition, aesthetics, ideology, virtuality, and mass culture. Readings drawn from Cubbit, Armes, Renov, Derrida, Galloway, Hilderbrand, Larkin, Elsaesser, Manovich, Deleuze, Sundaram, Juhasz, and others. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503O - Market Economy, Popular Culture, and Mass Media in Contemporary China (EAST 1950G) Interested students must register for EAST 1950G S01 (CRN 23679). MCM 1503P - Introduction to Theories of Narrative (ENGL 1900X) Interested students must register for ENGL 1900X S01 (CRN 14963).MCM 1503Q Communication Culture and Literary PoliticsA common concept of "medium" ties communication culture to art and literature. But what's a medium? Is it basic material for a work of art, like a sculptor's clay? Is it a communications device, like a telephone? Or is it a means to share information, like a network? The course explores the social ramifications of these questions, while also considering how politics can mediate art and technology, not just the other way around. Materials include novels by Delany, Yamashita, Mackey, and LeGuin; video art; and media and community theory by Nancy, Terranova, Rancière, Riley, Mattelart, and Liu. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503R Photography and Human RightsIn the context of the current abundance of "images of atrocity" showing global human rights violations, this course will return to one milestone exhibition, The Family of Man (1955) as a potential archive containing "visual clauses" of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Through this exhibition, some subsequent photographic examples and related films, we will ask new questions about the documentary genre, about the role of imagination in photography, and about the use of photography in studying history, including a history of a potential past that never was and of the actual present that should not be. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503S Cinema and MemoryThis course investigates some of the major ways in which cinema has been associated with memory from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Drawing from the history of cinema practice and criticism, as well as from key theories of memory, it provides multiple frameworks for making sense of cinema as a technology of memory. While we will examine popular films, emphasis is also placed on local, minority, non-theatrical, and small-scale cinemas. Topics to be covered include film archives, prosthetic memory, trauma, community and home movies, race, migration, nostalgia, and postmodernism. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503T Sensing Time: Affect and the Moving Image (GNSS 1960R)Interested students must register for GNSS 1960R. MCM 1503U Post '80's Asian Cinemas: From New Waves to Digital GenerationsThis course focuses on the "independent" cinemas of East Asia (the three Chinas, Korea, Japan, etc.), among other Asian film and video cultures (India, Iran, Thailand, etc.). We will explore entangled "new waves," genre cinemas, documentary movements, video amateurs and activists, as well as issues related to distribution (film festivals, disc and torrent cultures, shadow economies), aesthetics, genre, political society, and the growing field inter-Asian cultural studies. In short, beyond the "national" cinemas model, this course takes a comparative/regional look at the cinemas and film/video theories of the new Asia. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.  MCM 1503V Reading Michel FoucaultA study of Foucault's work from his early texts through his last. We will look at the ways Foucault challenged conventional thinking with his theories of discourse, epistemic rupture, disciplinary formations, power, sexuality, biopolitics, governmentality, and the care of the self. We will examine the questions and tensions that drive Foucault's work internally and will consider the ways his thinking has been both used and perhaps abused. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.  MCM 1503W Getting Emotional: Passionate Theories (ENGL 1560W)Interested students must register for ENGL 1560W. MCM 1503X The Ekphrastic Mode in Contemporary Literature (ENGL 1762B)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762B.MCM 1503Y Freud, Lacan and the Science of PsychoanalysisPsychoanalysis, it could be said, is the mother tongue of our modernity. If Hollywood fell hard for Freud in the 40s, it was not unlike other industries. This, in fact, is Foucault's argument: capitalism is an incitement to speak psychoanalysis, all the better to instate mechanisms of bio-power. This seminar will demonstrate why Foucault is precisely and productively wrong; how capitalism sets out to destroy psychoanalysis's prized discovery: surplus enjoyment. Rather than contest the claim that Freud invented a science of sex, we will uncover the exotic force of this science, which divides what bio-power tries to synthesize. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0220, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503Z Dialogues on Feminism and TechnologyThis experimental course asks students to reexamine the critical practices and discourses of science and technology through a feminist lens. “Dialogues on Feminism and Technology” is part of a worldwide network of feminist scholars, artists, and activists called femtechnet. We will ask students to consider how feminist thought contributes to computing, hacker culture, new media, nanotechnology, surrogacy, genetic culture, bioart, and a wide range of related topics. Students will be expected to participate in the discussion of the class both online and in person, give short presentations, write a research paper, and complete a creative assignment outlined in the syllabus. Limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1504A From Photography to Film: Theories of the Image (ENGL 1950E)Interested students must register for ENGL 1950E.MCM 1504B Democracy Among the Ruins (POLS 1823M)Interested students must register for POLS 1823M. MCM 1504G Chinese Women, Gender, and Feminism from Historical and Transnational Perspectives (EAST 1950B)Interested students must register for EAST 1950B.MCM 1504H The Panorama and the 19th-Century Visual Culture (ITAL 1340)Interested students must register for ITAL 1340. MCM 1504I Image, Music, Text (ENGL 1762C)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762C.MCM 1504J Kubrik (ENGL 1762D)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762D.MCM 1504K Queer Theories (HMAN 1971I)Interested students must register for HMAN 1971I. MCM 1504L Radical Poetics + World Cinema“Cinema is a language,” so they say. But what kind of language? Is it prose, telling stories about the world? Or is it poetry, with no formal rules but those it imposes upon itself, and with enough creative energy to remake or shatter the world? As we’ll see, “film poetry” has, since cinema was born, been a watchword to filmmakers and theorists for whom cinema might deform the world’s grotesque structures of power. We’ll read manifestoes of radical poetics and “film poetry”—authors range from Glissant and Kristeva to Ruiz and Pasolini—and watch political films from all seven continents.  MCM 1504M The Politics and Practices of Digital MediaCrossing the fields of digital humanities, critical theory, feminist theory, race studies, and new media studies, this course considers how technology is a constant negotiation of fantasies and fears, politics and practices. We will consider the negotiation between users, bodies, code and systems as we simultaneously practice and critique the prevalent forms of digital technology. We will address questions such as: how are political and social effects visible not only in the practice of digital technology, but in the underlying structures themselves? How are digital technologies both producing and produced by certain forms of sociality and cultural discourse?  MCM 1700 - Seminars in Production Topics vary from year to year and instructor to instructor.

S/NC MCM 1700U Experimental Data RepresentationExperimental Data Representation (EDR) focuses on generatively composed, multimedia experiences utilizing the large-scale, video wall within the Digital Scholarship Lab. This interdisciplinary course brings together students from Brown and RISD to explore the creation of screen-based visualizations via programs authored by course participants. EDR provides a platform for students to examine and design ways in which experiential variables (as output) may be algorithmically determined by data sets (as input). Readings and projects will engage areas such statistical graphics, cartography, multimodal interaction, data visualization, sonification, and media art. Instruction will be offered in programming environments: NodeBox, Processing, Max/MSP, and Pure Data. Enrollment limited to 20.MCM 1700V The Place of the Moving ImageOur experience of moving image-based media is intimately connected to our experience of place. Moving images have a unique ability to record, document, and archive places, and to alter or even produce the experience of place itself. Through readings, screenings, and production work, this hybrid production/theory course confronts place as a dynamic process, as more than the backdrop against which concrete actions and concepts form. Readings in philosophy, critical theory, and media theory. Screenings from popular, art, and experimental film/media. Students will produce three media projects related to questions of place. Previous production experience and technical competence are required.  MCM 1700W History, Theory and Practice of Storytelling using Stereoscopic ("3D") Motion Pictures (HMAN 1971C)Interested students must register for HMAN 1971C. MCM 1700X New Genre: Site and Sound (VISA 1710)Interested students must register for VISA 1710.MCM 1700Y Expanded Storytelling: Capture, Share and ExposeHow can we shoot a documentary inside an online videogame? How can we transform a historical archive into a dynamic narrative platform? How can we tell a story together with hundreds of other people? How can we create portraits with data retrieved from the Internet/mobile companies about ourselves? In this production course we will explore how emerging technologies and new habits of image making/sharing are challenging traditional forms of storytelling. In particular, we will focus on collaborative authorship, citizen journalism, fictional online persona creation, big data, and digital archives editing. Includes screenings, readings, technical-workshops (video/lighting/editing/coding), assignments, and a final project.  MCM 1970 - Directed Research: Modern Culture and MediaSection numbers vary by instructor.

Eighth semester students only MCM 2100 - Studies in Cultural and Social Theory MCM 2100A - Contemporary Feminist Theory and the Problem of the SubjectRecent feminist theory represents the persistence of identity politics and the problem of the subject in various forms: through the "intersectionality" of race, class and gender; in the idioms of psychoanalysis; in terms of the "queer" subject. We will examine these often conflicting theories and the subjects of feminism they invoke with particular attention to the modes of address.MCM 2100B - Criticism and Culture in Marxist TheoryMajor texts and arguments in 20th century Western Marxist cultural theory, from Lukács through the present. Focus on problems in the conception and reading of culture and cultural texts.

Primarily for MCM graduate students; other qualified graduate students and MCM seniors must obtain permission from the instructor.MCM 2100J Space and Time in Media DiscourseThe course asks how space and time are conceptually, socially and aesthetically constructed thru different media. Perspectival constructions of space and time were always in the center of analysis when it came to cultural representations of the subject. Here will be the main focus of the course: Reconstructing the discourses on perspectivism (Nietzsche), pictorial perspective (Renaissance perspective) and temporalities of media like seriality, repetition, duration etc. During the course we will look on concepts of narrative and temporal perspectives in the context of general theories of time as well as in the context of specific media as photography and film.  MCM 2100H - History of Theory: Histroicism vs. PsychoanalysisAn examination of the often heated debates between two major branches of cultural criticism: the Foucaultians (“historicism”) and the Lacanians (psychoanalysis). What are the stakes—theoretical, critical, political—in the debates? To what extent do the theories of Foucault and Freud/Lacan converge and diverge? Special focus on questions of the screen and spectatorship. Readings include Lacan, Foucault, Freud, Copjec, Butler, Laclau, Zizek, and others. Enrollment limited to 20.

Enrollment limited to 20 graduate students. Permission required for undergraduates only.MCM 2120E - Cinema, Media Culture and Political Theory: Rancière and OthersThere is a strand of contemporary thinkers concerned with political theory, in whose writings media and especially film play significant roles. Jacques Rancière has produced a major body of work on political theory, on aesthetics, and on film as well as media culture. This class will focus on a close examination of his political theory, his conceptions of film and media, and relations between the two fields in his writings. For comparison, we will also look at smaller samples of texts on political theory and film drawn from figures such as Agamben, Badiou, Jameson, etc. Enrollment limited to 20.

Issues include: "liveness"; social relevancy"; therapeutic discourse; TV personalities; media simulation; independent television; and new technologies/realisms.MCM 2300B - Television, Gender and SexualityThis course investigates how television produces and reproduces constructions of gender and sexuality through its institutional form (as it maps relations between the public and the private, the domestic and the social, the inside and the outside), narrative patterns (as it circulates family romances, links gender and genre, and mediates sexual and social tensions), and spectatorial relations (as it variously addresses viewers as sexed and gendered subjects, consumers and commodities, familial and defamiliarized viewers). Enrollment limited to 20. Preference given to graduate students, and then to seniors and juniors in Modern Culture & Media, Art- Semiotics, MCM-German, MCM-Italian, Semiotics French and Gender and Sexuality Studies.

This includes more than just the genre of animation films. We will start with an introduction into the tradition of the notion of 'livelihood' and the concept of the soul (e.g. anima): How is the spectator animated by film? Further we will proceed to texts that are discussing anthropological meanings of animation in the sense of animism. The main focus will then be on the discussion of general concepts of film as medium of animation per se and on different procedures of animating of and in film. Enrollment limited to 20.  MCM 2300G Collaboration and the Event of PhotographyThis course will question the concept of "collaboration" through a variety of moments and projects of collaboration between photographers, photographed persons and spectators that take place in different political contexts. Collaboration is a form of relation that may be idyllic or problematic, liberating or coercive, generating knowledge or disseminating ignorance, empowering or intimidating, involving assistance and solidarity as much as abuse; it may take place among friends or between enemies, and it may create friendship as much as it may complicate it. Reviewing this spectrum of possibilities we shall ask how collaboration informs and transforms the event of photography. Enrollment limited to 15 graduate students. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor permission. Students must register for the primary meeting and one film screening.  MCM 2310 - Studies in Textual FormationsMCM 2310C - Eisenstein and Political ModernismEisenstein's theories and films are a formative moment in cinema and media history, bringing together the ambitions of politicized film and modernist aesthetics. From the first, they were invoked by a range of radical theorists and filmmakers all the way from Brecht and Benjamin to Metz and Deleuze, as well as a variety of filmmaking practices such as militant documentary, third cinema and Godard. In this seminar, we will intensively study Eisenstein's theories, filmic practices and shifting historical contexts, from the heady days of the politically and aesthetically avant-garde 1920s, through the transformations of his theories in the 1930s and 1940s (many only available posthumously) and of his later film projects (several unfinished). We will also trace out some filiations and rereadings of Eisenstein within the history of politically conversant modernist film practices and theories. Permission required for undergraduates only; undergraduates seeking permission must attend the first class session.MCM 2310D - The Idea of a MediumWhat is a "medium" (a term we often seem to take for granted)? An examination of issues of medium specificity, intermediality, convergence, formalism and the idea of a "post-medium era," in relation to the media of print, photography, film, television, and digital media. We will also investigate the role of the museum and alternative screening or exhibition spaces as well as "virtual space" in delineating reception of the media. Enrollment limited to 20. Primarily for MCM graduate students; other qualified graduate students and MCM seniors must obtain permission after the first class. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 2310E - TV Space and TimeExplores television's temporal and spatial construction, considering how television demarcates time (regulating it through flow and segmentation, articulating work and leisure times, marking familial and national events, encouraging rhythms of reception) and space (mapping public and private space, defining a "global media culture" through local viewings, representing and enacting travel and exchange, creating imaginary geographies and communities). Enrollment limited to 20. Preferences given to graduate students. All others seek permission from the instructor. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 2310G - Cultural Studies and the Problem of FormThis course examines the emergence and contemporary practice of "cultural studies" with a focus on concepts of form.

Readings from Williams, Hall, Mulvey, Althusser, Spivak, Deleuze, Hartman, Agamben, Sedgwick, Galloway. Instructor permission required. All students seeking permission must attend first class.MCM 2310H - Television RealitiesHow does television bring "real" events to us? How do we define or know what's "real"? What kinds of "realities" exist on television, and how do they operate (in relationship to one another, to TV fantasy, to social structures, and to our everyday lives)? This course will consider not only some specific "reality genres" (news, catastrophe coverage, "live" and "historical" programs, "surveillance programming," documentary and docudrama, talk and game shows, reality series and "docu-soaps") but the representational modes that define the reality of commercial television as a whole. Enrollment limited to 20 graduate students. Permission required for undergraduates only.MCM 2310I - At the Limits: Media Representation of the HolocaustThe Holocaust has been described as unimaginable, at the limits of representation. Yet there have been numerous attempts to imagine and represent it, across media (film, television, graphic novels), genres (documentary, melodrama, comedy, fantasy), and modalities (through history and memory, "high" and "low" culture, fiction and nonfiction, reporting and marketing). Considering such attempts to represent the unrepresentable and mediate the immediacy of trauma, this course will explore media texts and theoretical/philosophical reflections on the Holocaust. Enrollment limited to 20. This course is for Graduates only. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor's permission.MCM 2330 - Critical Genres MCM 2500 - Studies in the History of MediaMCM 2500A - Film and ModernityAn examination of films and film movements from 1895 through the 1930s in relation to the rise of modernity, modernization, and modernism.

Students will produce a series of short video and/or installation projects that will explore critically the content and form of the Public Service Announcement and its historical precedents. In addition, the class will also collectively design, shoot, and produce, in collaboration with the RI Department of Education, their own Public Service Announcement that will air on local television stations. This will be a rare opportunity for undergraduate students not only to gain hands-on production experience, but also to think about and exhibit work outside of the University classroom context. Prerequisite: MCM 0700, MCM 0710, MCM 0720, MCM 0730, or MCM 0740.MCM 0800 - Freshman Seminars in Modern Culture and MediaMCM 0800A - Agency and RepresentationAgency is one of the most popular concepts across the disciplines today, but its definitions are often far from satisfactory in relation to representational forms such as literature and film. Using both fictional and theoretical texts, this course will examine some common assumptions about agency and develop a range of possible interpretations that will make the term viable in the study of artistic representation. For first year students only.MCM 0800B - Freshman Seminar on VisualityAn examination of the key texts (from such diverse fields as philosophy, visual arts, cultural studies) which describe the historical transformation of personal and social visual space. We will explore, for example, Renaissance and Cartesian optics, the mechanization of vision in the late nineteenth century and recent hypotheses around machine-centered visuality. For first year students only.MCM 0800C - Marx, Nietzsche, Freud: History of TheoryMany of the most pressing theoretical issues addressed by contemporary cultural analysis were first investigated in the works of these three ground-breaking intellectuals. This course will survey some of their major works, with attention to such concepts as ideology and the commodity; the will to power and truth in language; the unconscious and sexual difference. For first year students only.MCM 0800D - Sound for A Moving ImageA production/seminar. An examination of the role of sound in the works of five exemplary artists/filmmakers while we produce sound works for filmic projects. For first year students only.MCM 0800E - Race and Imagined FuturesWhy is race so important to imagining utopian or dystopian futures - to signaling world peace or Malthusian disaster? What do these imaginings tell us about contemporary anxieties over / desire for multiculturalism and globalization? This course responds to these questions by examining speculative, science and utopian fiction and films by African-, Asian- and Euro-American authors/film makers. Readings will be theoretical, as well as literary. Enrollment limited to 20. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 0800F - The Face in CinemaCinema has always been obsessed with the thematics of the human face. The close-up is most frequently associated with a revelation of intense human signification, with a rendering legible of the face as the signifier of the soul, and with the face as the privileged signifier of individuality, truth, beauty, and interiority as well as the most basic support of intersubjectivity. We will examine the face in the cinema in relation to the star system, theories of desire and affect, and a history of representation of the face (Darwin, Galton, Duchenne, etc.). Films by Dreyer, Hitchcock, Warhol, Wiseman, and others. Students must register for the primary meeting and one film screening. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYS.MCM 0800H - TV/Not TV: Theory and ProductionThis freshman seminar examines both commercial television and non-commercial media forms, considering the dialogue and/or tensions between them. What are the critical potentials and political stakes of viewing TV and of making independent media? How can we re-write TV's cultural codes by stimulating alternative readings, fostering new interpretive practices, creating different texts, or developing diverse modes and sites of distribution? Combining theory and practice (media studies, televisual and anti-televisual screenings, and simple production assignments using available technologies), this course encourages students to read and critique commercial television through both analysis and their own creative media practices. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYSMCM 0800I - Victim TestimoniesThis seminar will explore primarily first person narratives and historical and other accounts that seek to recreate victim's voices (of the Jewish Holocaust, Stalin's terror, the Algerian War, the Rwandan genocide) in order to understand the cultural contexts and narrative styles that fashion victims, shape readers' views of them, and lead us to take some more seriously than others. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYSMCM 0800J The Revolution is Being PhotographedThe course will examine the following idea: revolution is not an epoch making event but a dialect, a genre and grammar of practices and gestures. Images and moving images will be read as the "written" signs of this dialect, which document more and less known revolutionary moments. The recurrent familiar gestures repeated by the demonstrators will be studied as components of a language rather than planned actions carried out to achieve a given goal. The recurrence of the same idioms and gestures in various parts of the world requires questioning the universal and regional dimension of this language. Enrollment limited to 20 first year student. DVPS FYS LILE  MCM 0800K Pirates!This course examines the figure of the pirate and understandings of piracy from Treasure Island and Pirates of the Caribbean to Pirate Bay and the WTO–that is, from sea-faring pirates and early print culture to the Internet and "pirate modernity." What do pirates do, mean, stand for, teach us? Readings, discussions and screenings will focus on both the history of pirates and piracy as well as the contemporary (media) pirate and issues related to creativity and originality, intellectual property rights and global governance, participatory cultures and democratization, information feudalism and the pirate modernities of the Global South, enclosures and the common. Enrollment limited to 20 first year students. FYS  MCM 0800L - "I Don't Even Know Why They Call It Color TV": Television and Race in AmericaOur era has been called both "post-televisual" and "post-racial," yet images that define and are defined by (mis)understandings of race fill our screens (whether on TV sets or other means for disseminating TV). Formations of television and race not only remain pressing concerns but are intertwined, mutually constructing one another. This course thus explores how notions of race have been mediated and how media have figured race. Topics include: stereotype analysis; race in television history; scandal and crisis; intersections of gender and sexuality; consumerism and commodification; racial representation across TV genres (comedy, drama, sports, reality TV), and new media possibilities. DPLL FYS MCM 0800M - The Terrible Century (ENGL 0150U)Interested students must register for ENGL 0150U. MCM 0900 - Undergraduate Seminars in Modern Culture and MediaTopics vary from year to year and instructor to instructor. In each section, enrollment is limited to 20. Prerequisite: one previous MCM course (MCM 0100, 0150, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, 1110 or equivalent).MCM 0900A - Cinema and Stardom: Image/Industry/FantasyFocuses on the star within the "machinery" of Hollywood cinema: how stars function in the film industry, within cinematic and extra-cinematic texts, and at the level of individual fantasy and desire. Including screenings of films which exploit, foreground, or critique star images, also considers the ideological implications and cultural consequences of stardom.MCM 0900B - Global CyberpunkExamines how cyberpunk functions both as a global phenomenon and as a way to imagine the global. Texts include American science fiction by authors such as Octavia Butler and Neal Stephenson; anime such as Akira and AD Police Force; feature films such as Blade Runner; as well as theoretical texts on globalization, science fiction, and animation.MCM 0900F - Real TVThis course will investigate the construction of reality on U.S. television, considering not only specific reality genres (news and "magazine" programs, crisis coverage, docudrama, talk and game shows) but the discursive and representational modes that define the "reality" of commercial television as a whole. Issues include: "liveness"; social relevancy"; therapeutic discourse; TV personalities; media simulation; independent television; and new technologies/realisms.MCM 0900G - Representing the InternetInvestigates popular representations of the Internet (many of which precede the WWW) from cyberpunk to Supreme Court decisions, from mainstream film to Internet map sites. Considers the relationship between representation, ideology, culture, and technology. All written work for the seminar will be digital.MCM 0901C - Photography/Film/ArtQuestions of the nature of the photographic image have come to the fore in some of the most exciting modern art, such as the work of Cindy Sherman and Andy Warhol. In particular, the question of how the photograph relates to film and history has generated important questions about art and media. This course will analyze these questions through the work of such artists as Jeff Wall, Jean-Luc Godard, and Hiroshi Sugimoto. We will examine these in relation to writings that theorize the relationship of photography to film and art after World War Two. Readings include Benjamin, Barthes, and Krauss. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 undergraduates. WRITMCM 0901D - Film ComedyWhat makes some films so funny? This course will investigate many different forms of film comedy-- from slapstick physical gags involving hapless men and umbrella-wielding matrons, to eccentric verbal banter, to parodies that subvert state politics using puppet characters. Instead of treating film comedy as “just mindless escapism,” we will study how comedy's complex and slippery devices are central to the history of cinema. Readings in critical discourses about comedy, film history and film theory, e.g. Freud, Bergson, Benjamin, Rob King, Miriam Hansen, and Kathleen Rowe. Screenings range from silent slapstick, to communist satire, to romantic comedy, to political mockumentary. Enrollment limited to 20 undergraduates. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 0901E - The Fantastic in Contemporary CinemaThis course addresses the idea of the Fantastic from its definition to its articulations in contemporary cinema. Focusing more on form than on content, we will privilege a reading of the Fantastic as an effect rather than a genre or a theme: specific attention will be given to the relationships between filmic texts, spectatorship and the production of meaning. Screenings will include popular Hollywood cinema as well as European and independent films. We will discuss works by directors such as Lynch, Nolan, Fincher, Spielberg, Gondry, Cronenberg and Haneke. Readings will range from literary theory and psychoanalysis to film theory and semiotics. Enrollment limited to 20 undergraduates. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. All others will need written permission from the instructor.MCM 0901F - "America" in Diaspora LiteraturesHow have diasporic and immigrant writers come to see the United States? How do these writers negotiate dominant understandings of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, and language that come to define "the nation"? Is all immigrant/minority writing necessarily (auto)biographical? How are notions of history, memory, and futurity taken up by writers of diasporic and hybrid cultures in the US? These are some of the questions that this course will take up through a close reading of canonical and contemporary African-American, South/Asian-American, and Arab-American texts. This course is ideal for students interested in minority literatures, diaspora studies, and Ethnic Studies.MCM 0901G - Digital Culture and Art After 1989How can we contextualize new media art alongside earlier forms of media such as photography and cinema? Is its relation to the "outside world" primarily conceived as representation, or as process? What are the cultural effects of this mediatic shift? Taking as our starting point the fall of the Berlin Wall and the resulting spread of capitalism as a near-global political-economic system, we will "read" a variety of works of art and culture from several contemporary theoretical perspectives. Topics include digital media, the Internet, European cinema, and popular music. Readings from Galloway, Fukuyama, Deleuze, Hardt and Negri, Freud, Jameson, etc. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. LILE MCM 0901H - Uncomfortable MediaWhy are we often addicted to that which disgusts us? This course analyzes why "uncomfortable media" – media that plays with notions of the perverse, the abject, and the taboo – remain so popular in the American cultural imaginary. Studying a variety of popular television programs and films, this course will approach these viscerally transgressive media texts through analyzing representation (how cultural taboos appear in popular culture) and analyzing spectatorship (how viewers perform discomfort). We will examine how developments in genre and narrative form, affect studies, performance studies, and queer theory have contributed to theorizing the perverse. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. DVPS LILEMCM 0901I Body Count: Technologies of Life and DeathFrom the War on Terror and the global obesity crisis to self-help reality TV and new biotechnologies, questions of life and death have come to center stage of contemporary politics. This course investigates the theoretical and historical contexts under which "life itself" has emerged as a key arena of social, cultural, and technological importance. We will read critical studies of race, media, embodiment, and the state, tracing how distinctions between life and its others have structured the distribution of death, risk, and freedom in modernity. Topics include biocolonialism, cyborgs and swarms, U.S. prison regime, computer viruses, "bugchasing," suicide bombing. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. DVPS LILEMCM 0901J Adaptation Culture: New Media<---> Traditional Theatres (TAPS 0080)  Interested students must register for TAPS 0080. MCM0901K Statelessness and Global Media: Citizens, Foreigners, AliensWhat is citizenship? What does it mean to be granted or refused state protection within the global system? To better understand how nation-states govern subjects, we will consider the condition of refugees, displaced persons, illegal residents, undocumented aliens, and stateless persons. We will read the representations of non-citizenship in global media texts (humanitarian graphic narrative, migrant diary, atrocity photography, world cinema, war fiction, crowdsourced crisis mapping). This course will place a special emphasis on how perpetual warfare, territorial re-mappings, and nationality legislation continue to generate sliding scales of non-citizenship. Readings include Arendt, Balibar, Chatterjee, Foucault, Lowe, and Said. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20.  MCM 0901L African American Media Visibility: Image, Culture, CrisisThis course explores the "problem" of the black image in 20th - 21st century U.S. film and television. What is the role of spectacle and scandal in (re)presenting blackness to the public? Emphasis placed on the tension between invisibility and (hyper)visibility of the black subject in relation to gender and sexuality as well as the political, ethical, social, and psychical implications of such varying degrees of visual exposure. Topics include the aesthetics of black celebrity from Josephine Baker to Beyoncé, cinematic practices from filmmakers Spike Lee to Tyler Perry, and televisual blackness from The Cosby Show to Flavor of Love. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0220, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20. MCM 0901M Ishiguro, Amongst Others  (ENGL 0710L)Interested students must register for ENGL 0710L. MCM 0901N Body/Gesture/Cinema Antonin Artaud once called the body “a language to which it seems we no longer have the key.” This course is an attempt to take up his challenge in light of our experience at the cinema. Two questions will guide our investigation: Do the bodies on film “signify”? If so, how does this signifying practice trigger our own corporeal unconscious? We will explore a wide range of texts across film studies, theatre, anthropology, linguistics, and critical theory. Topics include gesture, ethnography, disability, violence, horror, and phenomenology. Readings include Didi-Huberman, Benjamin, Ricoeur, Merleau-Ponty, Kristeva, Shaviro, Sobchack, Naremore, Clover, Linda Williams, etc. MCM 0901O Reinventions of Life: Aesthetics, Biopolitics, and the Avant-GardesThe impulse to connect art with life runs through the avant-gardes of the early and mid-twentieth century. Yet recently, the question of what constitutes life itself has emerged with increasing persistence. In this course, we will reconsider the history of the avant-gardes – and avant-garde cinema particularly – in relation to this question. Drawing broadly on theories of how contemporary forms of life have been managed and made productive, we will explore the links between the avant-garde’s aesthetic and political practices and its ongoing efforts to redefine and reinvent social existence. Readings include Benjamin, Foucault, Lacan, Fanon, Debord, Mulvey, and Agamben. MCM 0901P After the War: Arendt, Duras and Anonymous from Berlin  (COLT 0710Y)Interested students must register for COLT 0710Y.MCM 0901Q - Governing Sex: Citizenship, Violence, MediaFrom the photographs of Abu Ghraib, to Tyler Clementi's suicide, and the rise of “revenge porn,” contemporary media have been central to understanding the ways in which sexuality, law, and citizenship are negotiated in our present moment. This course will take these moments of public crisis as instances from which to understand the politics of belonging within the framework of the contemporary nation-state. We will examine the inter-related problematics of sexuality as a site of state governance, and the anxieties about sexual violence as national crises. Assigned readings will include queer of color critique, critical race theory, feminism, and postcolonialism. MCM 0901R - Altered Cinema: The Cultural Politics of Film RevisionRepetition and variation define contemporary cinema texts. Media producers create multiple “cuts” of the same picture for domestic/international theater, television and home video markets. Meanwhile, consumers use new technologies to create their own textual variations and share them using informal distribution channels. This is a primary concern of Altered Cinema, which examines the history and culture of film revision from multiple perspectives, including originality, authorship, censorship, globalization, preservation, translation, copyright, fandom, new media and piracy. Screenings compare and contrast different editions, including director and fan cuts, of Metropolis, Star Wars, Dune and Night Watch among others. MCM 0901S - Mediating Reproduction: Feminism, Art, ActivismHow have feminist artists and activists imagined and transformed the politics of reproduction? This course explores the complex meanings of “reproduction” across media, performance, and public culture, with a focus on questions of sexuality, race, labor, and aesthetic practice. Situating reproduction in an expanded frame, we will consider the relationship between biological reproduction and the gendered labor of reproducing social life (e.g., domestic labor, sex work, care work). Throughout, we will pay special attention to the entanglements of artistic labor with women's reproductive labor. Topics include: eugenics, housework/welfare activism, art workers movements, biotechnologies, queer kinship, and feminist utopias. MCM 0901T - Shakespeare: The Screenplays (ENGL 0310E)Interested students must register for ENGL 0310E. MCM 0901U - What is Colonialism - Archives, Texts and Images (COLT 0812B)Interested students must register for COLT 0812B. MCM 0901W - The Space Within: Contemporary Borderland Moving Image PracticeIn this course we will examine post-NAFTA moving images that take as their subject the culture and politics of the Mexico-US Borderlands. We will tackle problems such as globalization, neoliberalism, the drug war, securitization, migration, biopolitics, and femicide. To make our claims we will place importance on film form as we unpack how the films figure and/or represent the bodies and spaces of the Borderlands. More, we will think seriously about how the concepts we adopt—including that of “border” itself—function as epistemological tools. This will be a course for those invested in Borderland issues and political moving image practice.MCM 0901X - Digital Cinema and the Inhuman From the incursions of biopolitics to the specter of ecological collapse, the problem of how life is organized, sustained, and functionalized strikes at the heart of contemporary society. And yet to whom or what “life” belongs remains an open and evolving question. This course examines contemporary digital cinema as a textual, technological, and political site to rethink the concept of “the human.” Drawing on theoretical traditions that investigate the nature of vitality, automation, and the distinction between human and nonhuman, we will study how bodies, identities, and categories of thought are troubled and transformed by moving images. MCM 0901Y - Puzzle FilmsInterested students must register for MES 0950. MCM 0902B - Film Classics: Greeks on the Silver Screen (MGRK 0810) Interested students must register for MGRK 0810.MCM 0902C - Digital Media in the Time of Ecological CrisisIn a time characterized by anthropogenic climate change, militaries forecast climate refugees, scientific communities broadcast the end of ‘nature’ while politicians engineer influence in a media ecosystem. What are the politics of how media represents science, the environment and ecological crisis? This course considers the historical emergence of digital media alongside ecology. By studying the exchange between scientific knowledge, digital technology and the communication of environmental crises at local and global scales, we will attempt to establish an interpretive framework for the matrix of politics, power, inequality and violence that accompanies the historical and temporal conditions consistent with climate change. DPLL MCM 0902D - The Visual Culture of SufferingThis seminar explores how suffering is constructed as a visual phenomenon. Through close analysis of photographs, films, monuments, and exhibitions, we will explore how suffering has been deployed, and the sort of meanings it has been assigned. We will examine four specific scenes of historical suffering: Lynching and Reconstruction, The Holocaust, Hiroshima, and 9/11. DPLL MCM 0902E - In Design: Layouts of Modern Media and DesignThis course aims to engage with media and design by thinking critically about them and asking questions about their relationship to the larger culture. We will survey design elements and principles and show how they construct products and media. Beginning from the basics, we will move onto systems to demonstrate how they lay out the rules of design. We will then move to digital media in which the design elements are re-organized by new uses of old principles and inventions of new ones. Readings include: Ranciere, Latour, Flusser, Bloch, and Baudrillard, alongside with Lupton, Buchanan, Papanek, Dunne and Raby. WRIT MCM 0902F - Post Cinema? Histories and Politics in the “Digital Revolution”The rapid influx of digital technology and so-called “new media” around the new millennium has led some to suggest that Cinema—conceived of as a photochemical technology experienced publicly as a mid-twentieth century cultural phenomenon—is dead or dying. This course explores the political and historical stakes of this claim, taking an archaeological and genealogical approach to problematize notions of technological progress and periodization. Rather than seeking to “rescue” cinema, we will instead explore how “the cinematic” has been adopted and dismantled by the logics of neoliberal governmentality, and what it can still offer for modes of political resistance. MCM 1110 - The Theory of the SignA survey of three late twentieth-century theorists: Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. Our analyses will focus on these figures as they emerge from and reorient the broad field of semiotics, with particular attention to the evolution of each oeuvre, the continuities and discontinuities that distinguish their theoretical claims, and their diverging legacies. Readings will include Althusser's Reading Capital and "Contradiction and Over-determination;" Derrida’s Of Grammatology and Spurs; and Foucault's This is Not a Pipe and History of Sexuality. Critical concepts to be examined include signification, reading, discourse, subjectivity, power, historicism, archaeology, the supplement, and difference. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, or 0260. MCM 1200 - Special Topics in Modern Culture and MediaTopics vary from year to year and instructor to instructor. In each section, enrollment is limited to 50. Written permission given after the first meeting. Prerequisite: one previous Modern Culture and Media course.MCM 1200D - African CinemaSubsaharan African cinemas 1960-present, primary emphasis on narrative films. We will analyze cultural and aesthetic strategies, (cinematic style, narrative, and subjects). in the context of postcolonial African and international film histories. Themes include: anticolonial resistance/nationalist ideologies; third cinema/international art cinemas; oral aesthetic culture and cinematic style; political critique (e.g., gender, state politics); media globalizationand resistence; the struggle for a mass audience. Enrollment limited to 50. Previous coursework in MCM, Africana Studies, or related areas highly recommended.MCM 1200G - Cinema and Stardom: Image/Industry/FantasyThis course focuses on the role of the star within the "machinery" of Hollywood: how stars function in the film industry, within cinematic and extra-cinematic texts, and at the level of individual fantasy and desire. The paradoxes posed by stars--represented as like yet unlike us, public yet privately known, commodities yet (super)human--suggest complex formations and implications of the star system. We will read film theories and histories and investigate films in which star images are foregrounded to explore these issues. MCM 1200K - Hollywood as Global CinemaCommonly treated as a U.S. national cinema, Hollywood film has long been a global institution dominating worldwide distribution. We reread U.S. narrative filmmaking and its products in relation to its global ambitions. Topics include: internationalizing the history of U.S. cinema; rethinking theories of the classical and anticlassical text; local, national and global spectatorship; concepts of cultural imperialism and cultural globalization; etc. Students interested in the class who have not fulfilled the prerequisite may apply to the instructor for permission to enroll. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50. Students must register for the primary meeting and one film screening. MCM 1200Q - Publicity and SurveillanceInvestigates the converging technologies and practices of publicity and surveillance. Considers phenomena such as webcams, face recognition technology and networked art, as well as concepts such as enlightenment, paranoia and exhibitionism. Theoretical, historical and legal readings.MCM 1201C - Imagined Networks, Glocal ConnectionsThis course examines emergent "imagined networks" (Arab Spring activists, global anti-globalization networks, global climate and financial systems) impacted by new media technologies and applications. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the changing relationship between the local and the global, and how "glocal" phenomena affect national and personal identities. Readings will be theoretical, historical, political and literary. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. MCM 1201E - Feminist Theory and the Question of Sexual Subjectivity Many contemporary theories of sexual subjectivity have to do not with the body but with gender. Gender is seen to have liberated people from the dictates of biology. But there are other feminist theories that see sexual subjectivity as reducible neither to anatomy (biologically male/female) nor to gender (culturally male/female/other). We'll look at current debates among theorists and will ask what these debates have to do with the canonical work of earlier feminist film theorists on questions of spectatorship. Readings include Butler, Copjec, Freud, Lacan, Irigaray, Kristeva, Mulvey, Doane, and others. Prerequisites: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.

Alongside the globalized military conflicts of the past 100 years is a corresponding globalization of visual media technologies. This course is a study of the links between the technologies, strategies, tactics and technologies of the military and those of various media industries. Topics include "target markets"; flight simulators; Google Earth; "the logistics of military perception;" the bombing of television and radio stations in Serbia and Iraq; the global presence of U.S. military bases and their role in the Americanization of global culture; and Michael Bay's Pentagon contracts.

In short, this course seeks to put his work in the context of ideas he meant to challenge and how those challenges have been met and incorporated in current thought about politics, society, and culture. We will follow Foucault's trajectory from what he termed "archaeology" to "geneaology." Prerequisites: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260 or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors.MCM 1201Z - On Being Bored (ENGL 1511L)Interested students must register for ENGL 1511L S01.MCM 1202A - The Poetics of Confession (ENGL 1561J)Interested students must register for ENGL 1561J S01 (CRN 26582).MCM 1202B - Literature and Politics (ENGL 1900D)Interested students must register for ENGL 1900D S01 (CRN 26519).MCM 1202C - Camera Works: The Theory and Fiction of Photography (ENGL 1900V) Interested students must register for ENGL 1900V S01 (CRN 26589).MCM 1202D - China Through the Lens: History, Cinema and Critical Discourse (EAST 1270) Interested students must register for EAST 1270 S01 (CRN 16635).MCM 1202E - Extreme Asian Cinema: Contemporary Genre Cinemas in an East Asian ContextSince the late 1990's, a discourse of "extreme Asian cinema" has gained traction among aficionados of global cinema, transforming our understandings of "national cinema." In this course, we will interrogate the spectacular aesthetics of "extremity," with its violence, polymorphous perversion, and grotesquerie, in relation to social and cultural phenomena in contemporary East Asia. By analyzing the genres of the gangster film, the revival of wuxia (heroic martial arts genre) and samurai films, horror, revenge films, and techno-dystopia and ecological disaster anime, we will explore "extreme Asian cinema," as a response to cultural shifts in global identities and film experience. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors.MCM 1202F - Science Fiction CinemaAlthough it raises compelling philosophical, aesthetic, and socio-historical questions, science fiction cinema has been underrepresented in scholarly literature and the academic curriculum. This course surveys the modern science fiction film from experiments in the silent era through the contemporary science fiction blockbuster (with particular emphasis on the latter). Covers various thematic concerns (disaster, post-apocalypse, the future, simulation, space travel and inhabitation, future cities, alien arrivals/invasions, posthumanity) and is international in scope. Films by Kubrick, Cameron, Scott, Verhoeven, Gilliam, Bigelow, Boyle, Emmerich, and others. Readings in theory, philosophy, cultural studies, film studies, gender studies, and fiction. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50.

Further, we will ask what forms of sociality or intersubjective relations these differing modes of violence posit or problematize, to gain insight into broader questions concerning the anti-sociality of violence and the prevalence of film violence in the social, cultural, and historical contexts of contemporary East Asia. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. MCM 1202J Faking Globalization: Media, Piracy, UrbanismThis course explores issues related to media, piracy, and development—centering on two entangled processes: faking and globalization. It asks: how do we understand globalization? And what does it mean to fake, forge or fail at it? We will examine theories of globalization and global media as well as challenges to dominant models of neoliberal modernity. Key examples include "pirate modernity," "information feudalism," parasites, terrorists, copycats and other markers of excess or imitation. Rather than dismissing alternative or counter-globalization practices as aberrations, the course examines how faking globalization enables both new forms of control and capacities in political society. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. MCM 1202K - Garibaldi Panorama: the Invention of a Hero (from pre-cinema to digital) (ITAL 1340) Interested students must register for ITAL 1340 S01 (CRN 14460). MCM 1202L - The Many Faces of Casanova (ITAL 1400J) Interested students must register for ITAL 1400J S01 (CRN 23869). MCM 1202M Issues in Contemporary Hollywood CinemaHow can we begin to think about contemporary Hollywood? This course examines Hollywood filmmaking from the end of the studio era through the present.

Is there political potential in the trend toward computerization? Or might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We’ll study the legitimizing rhetorics of our increasingly digital present, and read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural theory spanning the past half century. Historically arrayed, our topics range from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0220, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 50 sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  MCM 1202S Click here to Continue: Bodies, Identities and Practices in a Digital AgeWhy is the notion of ‘post-racial’ synonymous with this digital age? How are political and social effects visible not only in the practice of digital technology, but in the underlying structure itself? Crossing the fields of digital humanities, critical theory, feminist theory, race studies, and new media studies, this course considers how technology is a constant reflection of fantasies and fears. We will consider the interplay between users, humans, bodies, avatars, code and systems as we simultaneously practice and critique the prevalent forms of digital technology in our lives today. Readings include work by Nakamura, Gonzalez, Haraway and Coleman. MCM 1202T Perverse Cinema (ENGL 1762A)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762A. MCM1202U Sex and Sexuality in American FilmWhat is the connection between “sex” and “sexuality,” and how do these terms intersect in film and theory? In this course, we take a long historical view of both mainstream and experimental American film. We look at how sex and sexuality have been depicted on screen, while exploring cinema’s role in the construction of diverse, often radical, identities and practices. We test a range of critical approaches—deconstruction, feminism, close reading, queer historiography—to the theory of sexuality, and read major figures in film from Greta Garbo, Orson Welles, and Rock Hudson to Lizzie Borden, Divine, and the Brokeback cowboys.  MCM 1202X Twentieth-Century Western Theatre and Performance (TAPS 1250)Interested students must register for TAPS 1250. MCM 1202Y World Cinema in a Global Context (ITAL 1029)Interested students must register for ITAL  1029.  MCM 1202Z Native American sin the Media: Representation and Self-Representation on Film (ETHN 1890G)Interested students must register for ETHN 1890G. MCM 1203A Gaming of the Oppressed: Theory and DesignThis course gives an overview of various types of “serious games” or “anti-oppressive games” that range from videogames to immersive transmedia storytelling games. We will explore issues of why gaming is so enticing and the potential games have through their history, procedure, and design. We will then examine the role games play in our everyday lives and games’ potential for understanding motivation, education, and labor. Students will also work with complimentary theories of race formation, queer theory, and gender identity. At the end of the semester, students have the opportunity to create their own game.  MCM 1203B Politics + Aesthetics of HollywoodHollywood is an industry, a cultural bellwether, and a globally distributed artform. This course will consider these functions together, asking how Hollywood’s aesthetics connect to its ideology and commerce. Focusing on the post-studio life of Hollywood, and on Hollywood’s preoccupation with sex and violence, we’ll pay special attention to the genres of melodrama and crime film, 1945-2000. We’ll read film theory, “Hollywood novels,” and documents of film culture, and watch films by filmmakers who were central to the industry (like Hitchcock and Minnelli) as well as by those at its margins (from Lupino and Waters to Burnett and Cronenberg).  MCM 1203C Tv Time Machine: History, Represenation and PoliticsHow does television both document and represent historical events? This course examines American history “as seen on TV”: how viewers watch noteworthy events live; how television archives crucial moments and time periods; and how genres such as the news, period drama and sitcom, and reality TV differ in their representations. We consider what makes television a unique medium for which to study history, particularly focusing on questions of gender, class, race, and sexuality. Utilizing approaches including the study of collective memory, historiography, aesthetic and textual analysis, and media theory, we will assess the imbrication of American history and popular culture.  MCM 1203D Back to the Future: Nostalgia and Futurity in Contemporary Sci-Fi TV and TelefantasyHow do contemporary science fiction and fantasy television programs not only imagine our future, but also our past? How do visions of the future from the past inform both of these genres today? And what does contemporary TV’s nostalgic longing for futures past suggest about where the medium is headed? This course addresses these and other related questions while providing students with an overview of contemporary English-language sci-fi and fantasy television. The course combines elements of both the lecture and seminar, and will included screenings of such varied programs as Babylon 5, True Blood, and Dr. Who.  MCM 1203E Intellectural Life and Culture in the Post-Western WorldNo one alive today has experience of a world in which the United States is not the leading economic power. This is the world we shall all encounter, however, very soon. Such headlines are small indices of an emerging post-Western future. We will investigate the intellectual, political and aesthetic culture of this future. What will change when Judaeo-Christian societies no longer monopolize global conversation? When societies that have historically rejected Western capitalism come to dominate it? What new ideas will be unleashed in such a world, and what will their consequences be for our thinking about politics, economy and identity? This is a half-credit course.  MCM 1500 - Senior Seminars in Modern Culture and MediaPreference given to seniors in any of the MCM concentrations. In each section, enrollment is limited to 20.

Theoretical and historical readings. Class hours include viewing time.MCM 1500X - Middlemarch and the SopranosThe world of The Sopranos has been called "a postmodern Middlemarch, whose inhabitants' moral and spiritual development (or devolution) unfolds within a parochial social milieu." This course offers a comparative analysis of Eliot's 1871-72 novel and HBO's (continuing) television drama, juxtaposing these two very popular, very powerful serializations in formal, thematic, ideological and narrative terms.MCM 1501B - Nation and Identity: The Concept of National CinemaComparative study of constructions of nationhood in films and written texts about cinema. Interrogation of the discursive, political and epistemological power achieved by different version of the concept "national cinema" and the kinds of collective identities they imagine, from early cinema to globalized media. Readings by theorists, historians and filmmakers. Screenings from pertinent contexts (e.g. Weimar Germany, U.S. classical cinema, Japanese 1930s, third cinema, New German Cinema, New Chinese cinema, multinational corporate cinema, etc.)MCM 1501C - National Cultures/Global Media SpheresContemporary cultural practices and media processes are often described as being implicated in "globalization," but this is a linkage that may well predate the present. This course examines theoretical, historical, and critical texts that conceive of media culture through notions of globalization, with attention to the status of nation and cultural identity in a transnational context.MCM 1501I - Reading MarxWhat is it to read Marx now? We will begin with a group of key texts written by Marx drawn from different points in his development, including the first volume of Capital. We will study influential later reinterpretations and commentaries on Marx that argue for his contemporary importance (e.g., Althusser, Balibar, Benjamin, J. Butler, Derrida, Haraway, Hardt, Negri, Zizek, etc.MCM 1501K - Seeing Queerly: Queer Theory, Film, VideoWhile cinema has typically circumscribed vision along (hetero) sexually normative lines, can film also empower viewers to see "queerly"? How do we, as sexual subjects (gay and straight), "look" in the cinema, in both senses of the word? How have sexual desires been portrayed across film history, and how might audiences wield the look, appropriating or creating imagery with which to (re)formulate subjectivity and sexuality? This course addresses such questions as it considers both "mainstream" and "alternative" productions. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening. MCM 1501N - Television Time and SpaceExplores television's temporal and spatial construction, considering how television demarcates time (regulating it through flow and segmentation, articulating work and leisure times, marking familial and national events, encouraging rhythms of reception) and space (mapping public and private space, defining a "global media culture" through local viewings, representing and enacting travel and exchange, creating imaginary geographies and communities).MCM 1501O - Television, Gender, and SexualityThis course investigates how television produces and reproduces constructions of gender and sexuality through its institutional form (as it maps relations between the public and the private, the domestic and the social, the inside and the outside), narrative patterns (as it circulates family romances, links gender and genre, and mediates sexual and social tensions), and spectatorial relations (as it variously addresses viewers as sexed and gendered subjects, consumers and commodities, familial and defamiliarized viewers). DPLL MCM 1501Q - The Close-Up: Theory and PracticeAn examination of the use of the close-up in film and theory, from the "primitive" cinema to IMAX and from Münsterberg to Aumont and Deleuze. Special attention to the way in which the close-up has been associated insistently with the face and its heightened cultural significance, with the advent of a "cinematic language," and with questions of cinematic space and scale.MCM 1501W - The Rhetoric of New MediaAn examination of contemporary theories and practices of "new media," but in particular cyberspace; investigates the ways in which information technologies are challenging our inherited ideas about knowledge and ethics. All written work for the seminar will be digital. Application required. Occasional screenings to be announced during semester.MCM 1502B - Publicity and SurveillanceInvestigates the converging technologies and practices of publicity and surveillance. Considers phenomena such as webcams, face recognition technology and networked art, as well as concepts such as enlightenment, paranoia and exhibitionism. Theoretical, historical and legal readings.MCM 1502C - Race And/As SpectacleTheoretical and historical examination of race and/as spectacle, from 19th century world fairs and exhibitions to 20th century media events. Focuses on the productive relationship between race and media, from early cinema to the Internet.MCM 1502E - Theories of the Photographic ImageExamines the history of attempts to assimilate the photographic image to a theory of representation. Will analyze theories of photography, chronophotography, film with respect to issues of time, subjectivity, historicity, the archive. Will also address the rise of the digital image and its potential threat to photography. Readings in Kracauer, Benjamin, Bourdieu, Barthes, Batchen, Marey, Bazin, Aumont and others.MCM 1502H - Information, Discourse, NetworksExamines the historical emergence of information in relation to language and networks more broadly defined. Some key issues: the rise of new media, cyborgs and other post-human beings, the intersections between post-structuralism and cybernetics and between computer and human languages, and networked multitudes. Readings from Friedrich Kitler, Jacques Derrida, Norbert Wiener, Williams Burroughs, Felix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the lab.MCM 1502J - Race as ArchiveExamination of the importance of race to the logic and practice of biological, technological and cultural archives. Engaging the similarities and differences between the categorization of race in these fields, the course will focus on race as a justification for archives more broadly, and race as an archival trace "evidence" of a biological or cultural history. Readings will be theoretical, historical and literary. Preferences given to students in Modern Culture and Media, Art-Semiotics, Modern Culture and Media- German, Modern Culture and Media-Italian, Semiotics-French, Ethnic Studies, and Science & Technology Studies. All others seek permission from the instructor.MCM 1502K - Real TVHow does television bring "real" events to us? How do we know what's "real"? What kinds of "realities" exist on television, and how do they operate (in relationship to one another, to TV fantasy, and to our everyday lives)? This course will consider not only some specific "reality genres" (news, catastrophe coverage, "surveillance programming," documentary and docudrama, talk and game shows, reality series and "docu-soaps") but the representational modes that define the reality of commercial television as a whole. Issues to be addressed include: TV "liveness," crisis and scandal, therapeutic discourses, "surveillance society," media simulation, realism and anti-realism, civic and commercial discourses, and television's construction of history and knowledge. Preference given to graduate students, seniors, and juniors in Modern Culture & Media and Art-Semiotics. Prerequisites - two of the following: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, 1110. Interested students who cannot pre-register should come to the first day of class for an application for admission by instructor permission.MCM 1502N - Derrida and TelecommunicationsDerrida famously proclaimed that writing preceded speech¿rendering all communications a form of writing¿but he also argued that the history of psychoanalysis would have been different if Freud had used e- instead of snail-mail. Tracing Derrida's thought re. telecommunications from Grammatology to Writing Machines, as well as engaging his interlocutors (Samuel Weber, Avital Ronell, etc.), this course examines the importance of medium-specificity to post-structuralism. Prerequisite - two of the following: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, 1110. Preferences given to juniors and seniors in Modern Culture and Media, Art-Semiotics, Modern Culture and Media-German, Modern Culture and Media-Italian, Semiotics-French, Science Studies, Anthropology, Comparative Literature, English, Gender Studies, and Philosophy.

We will examine the discursive, political and epistemological power achieved by different versions of the concept of "national cinema" and the kinds of collective identities they imagine, from early cinema to current globalized media. Readings by theorists, historians and filmmakers. Screenings from pertinent contexts (for example, Weimar Germany, U.S. classical cinema, Japanese 1930s, third cinema, New German Cinema, New Chinese cinema, multinational corporate cinema, etc). Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 1502T - Film Noir: Femmes Fatales, Urban Space, and ParanoiaAn examination of film noir, concentrating on the classic films of the 1940s and 1950s, but also investigating film noir's relation to German Expressionism as well as remakes and reincarnations of the genre such as Blade Runner. We will discuss various methodologies: psychoanalysis, ideological analysis, close textual analysis, the historiography of noir. Films by Lewis, Tourneur, Wilder, Hawks, Lang, Pabst, Welles, Preminger, Hitchcock, Ray. Readings in Copjec, Zizek, Naremore, Dimendberg, Vernet, Jameson. Enrollment limited to 20. Primarily for MCM senior concentrators and MCM graduate students; other qualified students must obtain permission from the instructor.MCM 1502U - Media and Memory: Representing the HolocaustThe Holocaust has been described as unimaginable, at the limits of representation. Yet there have been numerous attempts to imagine and represent it, across media (film, television, graphic novels), genres (documentary, melodrama, comedy, fantasy), and modalities (through history and memory, "high" and "low" culture, fiction and nonfiction, reporting and marketing). Considering such attempts to represent the unrepresentable and "mediate" the immediacy of trauma, this course will explore media texts and theoretical/philosophical reflections on the Holocaust. Enrollment limited to 20. Prerequisite: one of the following: MCM 0110, MCM 0230, MCM 0240, MCM 0250, MCM 0260, MCM 1110. Preferences given to juniors, seniors, and graduate students. All others seek permission from the instructor.MCM 1502V - Theories of the Body and the Limits of ConstructionismScholars currently argue that cultural constructionism went too far, that theories of subjectivity that dominated the academy for over two decades neglected the materiality of the body. We will examine these criticisms as well as what it means to theorize the body. Readings include Merleau-Ponty (phenomenology), Freud and Dolto (psychoanalysis), Damasio (neurology), Fausto-Sterling (biology), Butler, Grosz, Kirby, Moore, Wilson, etc. Enrollment limited to 20. Prerequisite: one related MCM course.MCM 1502X - Race and/as TechnologyThis course asks: to what extent can race be considered a technology? That is, not an identity that is true or false, but rather a technique that one uses, even as one is used by it? Ranging from contemporary cyborgs to early 20th century eugenics, it investigates what race does, regardless of what we think it is. Readings will be theoretical, historical and literary. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. All other seek permission from the instructor. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 1502Y - Simulation Speed Implosion: Theories of Media TechnologyJean Baudrillard and Paul Virilio are generally regarded as two of media studies most notorious pessimists and hyperbolists. Yet they are also theorists who treat the media as technological systems that transcend the traditionally held boundaries of the cultural, economic, social and political. This course will place Baudrillard and Virilio in a context of media theory and technology studies rooted in the work of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan while demonstrating important differences between these figures. We will engage in close readings of Baudrillard's and Virilio's major works as well as some of the writings of their interlocutors. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 1502Z - Art Cinema and Its LegacyArt cinema is associated with directors who achieved international prominence after World War II, with unconventional narrative films that were understood as expressions of original artistic subjectivities and film movements like the French New Wave (e.g., Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini, Godard, Resnais, and many others). Art cinema defined how many imagined non-Hollywood cinema in a global context, but was neither avant-garde nor necessarily political. Its legacy persists to the present, for example, in the reception of recent Iranian cinema and New Taiwanese cinema. We will study its aesthetic and textual strategies, its significance in global film history, and its theoretical implications. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors, and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.MCM 1503A - The Ethics of Romanticism (ENGL 1560Y)Interested students must register for ENGL 1560Y S01.MCM 1503B - Jane Austen and George Eliot (ENGL 1560A)Interested students must register for ENGL 1560A S01.MCM 1503C - "Terrible Beauty": Literature and the Terrorist Imaginary (ENGL 1760I) Interested students must register for ENGL 1760I S01.MCM 1503D - W. G. Sebald and Some Interlocutors (ENGL 1761Q)Interested students must register for ENGL 1761Q S01 (CRN 26515).MCM 1503E - Aesthetic Theory/Cultural StudiesAesthetic thought has a long and varied history, but aesthetic categories have only recently become a central concern of cultural studies. This course combines readings in the history of aesthetics and aesthetic education; twentieth-century work on aesthetics from various philosophical and disciplinary perspectives (from “aesthetic theory” and the “anti-aesthetic” to “a return to aesthetics”); and recent scholarship addressing (while not necessarily celebrating) the reemergence of aesthetic questions in cultural and media studies and the evolving relationship of the aesthetic to categories such as ideology, form and virtuality. Readings from Schiller and Kant to Adorno, Berube, Foster, Galloway, Ranciere and Spivak. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. Instructor permission required.MCM 1503F - Critical Methodologies: Contemporary Literary Theory (ENGL 1900I) Interested students must register for ENGL 1900I S01 (CRN 27039).MCM 1503G - Representations of Suffering in History and MediaThis course will explore accounts of suffering in works on slavery, genocide, as well as extra-legal violence (lynching, gay bashing) in order to explore debates about the representation of violence and the use of new technologies of representation. Readings include historians, critical and legal theorists, and journalists. We will also explore recent debates around images of suffering and the reemergence of "shame" as a topic in the context of combatting violence and asserting identity in queer theory. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors, seniors and graduate students. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110, or instructor permission.MCM 1503H - Literature and the Ideology of the Aesthetic (ENGL 1950B) Interested students must register for ENGL 1950B S01 (CRN 26963).MCM 1503I - Digital Media and Race: Ethnicity, Technicity, EmbodimentAre we becoming post-racial in the digital age? This course questions what constitutes "race" through exploration of the ways technology affects identity. Turning to examples from new media art, World of Warcraft, cyborgs and cyberculture, the role of race in the "natural" body, and the formation of identity in online communities, we will explore the relationship between race and digital media. We draw upon critical race theory, critical theories of new media and technology, postcolonial theory and posthumanism to provide a clear and nuanced understanding of race and identity, situating it within the digital culture of our increasingly virtual world. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.MCM 1503J - Film Authors and AuthorshipWho is the "author" of a film? Drawing on readings about authorship from literary theory, semiotics, poststructuralism and film studies, and close attention tofilms by major American and international directors (e.g. Hitchcock, Welles, Mizoguchi, Antonioni, Tarkovsky, Godard, Akerman, Jodorowsky, Deren, Brakhage, Malick, Scorsese, Lynch, Kiarostami, Aronofsky, Nolan, Bigelow), this course examines theories and practices of film authorship and the historical development of the idea of film directors as authors within film criticism and theory. Film authorship will also be considered in relation to other formations such as genre, national cinema, gender, race, coloniality, etc. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503K - Memory and Modern Media: Permanence and Presence in Film and Digital MediaFilm and digital media, often claim to remember or preserve our experiences. But what does it mean to capture, catalogue and archive experiences by such media? How are mediated memories encoded within a larger cultural order? How do these media make fleeting moments permanent, lend an air of truth to the image, compose an archive of experiences? We will study key examples in photography, experimental and mainstream cinema, video art, and new media, which engage with memory and visuality. Readings include key critics and theorists concerned with these issues. Screenings will include Marey, Brakhage, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, Frampton, and Marker. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503L - South Korean Cinema: From Golden Age to Korean Wave (EAST 1950U) Interested students must register for EAST 1950U S01 (CRN 27437).MCM 1503M - Outside MediaMedia technologies (e.g. film, television, digital) are often understood in relation to a rather limited set of locations, meanings, and practices. For instance, we generally take for granted that films are exhibited in movie theaters and TV in the home. Beyond such routine sites, this course examines the import of anthropological and spatial approaches to media and media theory. Focus on non-domestic media, intermediality, and contexts outside the cultural center (e.g. subaltern, non-western). Readings draw on anthropology, cultural geography, social theory, and media/cultural studies. Students will also develop media ethnographic projects utilizing video, photography, sound recording, etc. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503N Video TheoryThis course takes as its starting point Sean Cubitt's assertion in the early 1990s that there is not and never will be "video theory"—an assertion tethered to video's perceived lack of a single or essential form. Focus on the history and theory of video across "old" and "new" media, including sound and image reproduction, broadcasting, video art, documentary, gaming, digital culture, and the internet. We will consider various theoretical understandings of video and their relation to production/distribution/ exhibition, aesthetics, ideology, virtuality, and mass culture. Readings drawn from Cubbit, Armes, Renov, Derrida, Galloway, Hilderbrand, Larkin, Elsaesser, Manovich, Deleuze, Sundaram, Juhasz, and others. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503O - Market Economy, Popular Culture, and Mass Media in Contemporary China (EAST 1950G) Interested students must register for EAST 1950G S01 (CRN 23679). MCM 1503P - Introduction to Theories of Narrative (ENGL 1900X) Interested students must register for ENGL 1900X S01 (CRN 14963).MCM 1503Q Communication Culture and Literary PoliticsA common concept of "medium" ties communication culture to art and literature. But what's a medium? Is it basic material for a work of art, like a sculptor's clay? Is it a communications device, like a telephone? Or is it a means to share information, like a network? The course explores the social ramifications of these questions, while also considering how politics can mediate art and technology, not just the other way around. Materials include novels by Delany, Yamashita, Mackey, and LeGuin; video art; and media and community theory by Nancy, Terranova, Rancière, Riley, Mattelart, and Liu. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503R Photography and Human RightsIn the context of the current abundance of "images of atrocity" showing global human rights violations, this course will return to one milestone exhibition, The Family of Man (1955) as a potential archive containing "visual clauses" of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Through this exhibition, some subsequent photographic examples and related films, we will ask new questions about the documentary genre, about the role of imagination in photography, and about the use of photography in studying history, including a history of a potential past that never was and of the actual present that should not be. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503S Cinema and MemoryThis course investigates some of the major ways in which cinema has been associated with memory from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Drawing from the history of cinema practice and criticism, as well as from key theories of memory, it provides multiple frameworks for making sense of cinema as a technology of memory. While we will examine popular films, emphasis is also placed on local, minority, non-theatrical, and small-scale cinemas. Topics to be covered include film archives, prosthetic memory, trauma, community and home movies, race, migration, nostalgia, and postmodernism. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1503T Sensing Time: Affect and the Moving Image (GNSS 1960R)Interested students must register for GNSS 1960R. MCM 1503U Post '80's Asian Cinemas: From New Waves to Digital GenerationsThis course focuses on the "independent" cinemas of East Asia (the three Chinas, Korea, Japan, etc.), among other Asian film and video cultures (India, Iran, Thailand, etc.). We will explore entangled "new waves," genre cinemas, documentary movements, video amateurs and activists, as well as issues related to distribution (film festivals, disc and torrent cultures, shadow economies), aesthetics, genre, political society, and the growing field inter-Asian cultural studies. In short, beyond the "national" cinemas model, this course takes a comparative/regional look at the cinemas and film/video theories of the new Asia. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.  MCM 1503V Reading Michel FoucaultA study of Foucault's work from his early texts through his last. We will look at the ways Foucault challenged conventional thinking with his theories of discourse, epistemic rupture, disciplinary formations, power, sexuality, biopolitics, governmentality, and the care of the self. We will examine the questions and tensions that drive Foucault's work internally and will consider the ways his thinking has been both used and perhaps abused. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110.  MCM 1503W Getting Emotional: Passionate Theories (ENGL 1560W)Interested students must register for ENGL 1560W. MCM 1503X The Ekphrastic Mode in Contemporary Literature (ENGL 1762B)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762B.MCM 1503Y Freud, Lacan and the Science of PsychoanalysisPsychoanalysis, it could be said, is the mother tongue of our modernity. If Hollywood fell hard for Freud in the 40s, it was not unlike other industries. This, in fact, is Foucault's argument: capitalism is an incitement to speak psychoanalysis, all the better to instate mechanisms of bio-power. This seminar will demonstrate why Foucault is precisely and productively wrong; how capitalism sets out to destroy psychoanalysis's prized discovery: surplus enjoyment. Rather than contest the claim that Freud invented a science of sex, we will uncover the exotic force of this science, which divides what bio-power tries to synthesize. Prerequisite: MCM 0110, 0220, 0230, 0240, 0250, 0260, or 1110. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors. MCM 1503Z Dialogues on Feminism and TechnologyThis experimental course asks students to reexamine the critical practices and discourses of science and technology through a feminist lens. “Dialogues on Feminism and Technology” is part of a worldwide network of feminist scholars, artists, and activists called femtechnet. We will ask students to consider how feminist thought contributes to computing, hacker culture, new media, nanotechnology, surrogacy, genetic culture, bioart, and a wide range of related topics. Students will be expected to participate in the discussion of the class both online and in person, give short presentations, write a research paper, and complete a creative assignment outlined in the syllabus. Limited to 20 juniors and seniors.  MCM 1504A From Photography to Film: Theories of the Image (ENGL 1950E)Interested students must register for ENGL 1950E.MCM 1504B Democracy Among the Ruins (POLS 1823M)Interested students must register for POLS 1823M. MCM 1504G Chinese Women, Gender, and Feminism from Historical and Transnational Perspectives (EAST 1950B)Interested students must register for EAST 1950B.MCM 1504H The Panorama and the 19th-Century Visual Culture (ITAL 1340)Interested students must register for ITAL 1340. MCM 1504I Image, Music, Text (ENGL 1762C)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762C.MCM 1504J Kubrik (ENGL 1762D)Interested students must register for ENGL 1762D.MCM 1504K Queer Theories (HMAN 1971I)Interested students must register for HMAN 1971I. MCM 1504L Radical Poetics + World Cinema“Cinema is a language,” so they say. But what kind of language? Is it prose, telling stories about the world? Or is it poetry, with no formal rules but those it imposes upon itself, and with enough creative energy to remake or shatter the world? As we’ll see, “film poetry” has, since cinema was born, been a watchword to filmmakers and theorists for whom cinema might deform the world’s grotesque structures of power. We’ll read manifestoes of radical poetics and “film poetry”—authors range from Glissant and Kristeva to Ruiz and Pasolini—and watch political films from all seven continents.  MCM 1504M The Politics and Practices of Digital MediaCrossing the fields of digital humanities, critical theory, feminist theory, race studies, and new media studies, this course considers how technology is a constant negotiation of fantasies and fears, politics and practices. We will consider the negotiation between users, bodies, code and systems as we simultaneously practice and critique the prevalent forms of digital technology. We will address questions such as: how are political and social effects visible not only in the practice of digital technology, but in the underlying structures themselves? How are digital technologies both producing and produced by certain forms of sociality and cultural discourse?  MCM 1700 - Seminars in Production Topics vary from year to year and instructor to instructor.

S/NC MCM 1700U Experimental Data RepresentationExperimental Data Representation (EDR) focuses on generatively composed, multimedia experiences utilizing the large-scale, video wall within the Digital Scholarship Lab. This interdisciplinary course brings together students from Brown and RISD to explore the creation of screen-based visualizations via programs authored by course participants. EDR provides a platform for students to examine and design ways in which experiential variables (as output) may be algorithmically determined by data sets (as input). Readings and projects will engage areas such statistical graphics, cartography, multimodal interaction, data visualization, sonification, and media art. Instruction will be offered in programming environments: NodeBox, Processing, Max/MSP, and Pure Data. Enrollment limited to 20.MCM 1700V The Place of the Moving ImageOur experience of moving image-based media is intimately connected to our experience of place. Moving images have a unique ability to record, document, and archive places, and to alter or even produce the experience of place itself. Through readings, screenings, and production work, this hybrid production/theory course confronts place as a dynamic process, as more than the backdrop against which concrete actions and concepts form. Readings in philosophy, critical theory, and media theory. Screenings from popular, art, and experimental film/media. Students will produce three media projects related to questions of place. Previous production experience and technical competence are required.  MCM 1700W History, Theory and Practice of Storytelling using Stereoscopic ("3D") Motion Pictures (HMAN 1971C)Interested students must register for HMAN 1971C. MCM 1700X New Genre: Site and Sound (VISA 1710)Interested students must register for VISA 1710.MCM 1700Y Expanded Storytelling: Capture, Share and ExposeHow can we shoot a documentary inside an online videogame? How can we transform a historical archive into a dynamic narrative platform? How can we tell a story together with hundreds of other people? How can we create portraits with data retrieved from the Internet/mobile companies about ourselves? In this production course we will explore how emerging technologies and new habits of image making/sharing are challenging traditional forms of storytelling. In particular, we will focus on collaborative authorship, citizen journalism, fictional online persona creation, big data, and digital archives editing. Includes screenings, readings, technical-workshops (video/lighting/editing/coding), assignments, and a final project.  MCM 1970 - Directed Research: Modern Culture and MediaSection numbers vary by instructor.

Please check Banner for the correct section number and CRN to use when registering for this course. Eighth semester students only MCM 2100 - Studies in Cultural and Social Theory MCM 2100A - Contemporary Feminist Theory and the Problem of the SubjectRecent feminist theory represents the persistence of identity politics and the problem of the subject in various forms: through the "intersectionality" of race, class and gender; in the idioms of psychoanalysis; in terms of the "queer" subject. We will examine these often conflicting theories and the subjects of feminism they invoke with particular attention to the modes of address.MCM 2100B - Criticism and Culture in Marxist TheoryMajor texts and arguments in 20th century Western Marxist cultural theory, from Lukács through the present. Focus on problems in the conception and reading of culture and cultural texts. Where appropriate, consideration of interaction with other major theoretical frameworks (e.g., aesthetics, phenomenology, semiotics, psychoanalysis, feminism, postcolonial criticism, globalization theory, etc.). Enrollment limited to 20 graduate students. Permission required for undergraduates only.MCM 2100G - Freud and LacanReadings of major texts by Freud and Lacan will stress the relations between language, subjectivity and sexuality and the feminist use and/or critique of psychoanalytic concepts.

Familiarity with semiotic and poststructuralist theory required. Enrollment limited to 20. Primarily for MCM graduate students; other qualified graduate students and MCM seniors must obtain permission from the instructor.MCM 2100J Space and Time in Media DiscourseThe course asks how space and time are conceptually, socially and aesthetically constructed thru different media. Perspectival constructions of space and time were always in the center of analysis when it came to cultural representations of the subject. Here will be the main focus of the course: Reconstructing the discourses on perspectivism (Nietzsche), pictorial perspective (Renaissance perspective) and temporalities of media like seriality, repetition, duration etc. During the course we will look on concepts of narrative and temporal perspectives in the context of general theories of time as well as in the context of specific media as photography and film.  MCM 2100H - History of Theory: Histroicism vs. PsychoanalysisAn examination of the often heated debates between two major branches of cultural criticism: the Foucaultians (“historicism”) and the Lacanians (psychoanalysis). What are the stakes—theoretical, critical, political—in the debates? To what extent do the theories of Foucault and Freud/Lacan converge and diverge? Special focus on questions of the screen and spectatorship. Readings include Lacan, Foucault, Freud, Copjec, Butler, Laclau, Zizek, and others. Enrollment limited to 20. This course is for Graduates only.

Enrollment limited to 20. This course is for Graduates only. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor's permission. Students must register for the primary meeting and the film screening. MCM2100K American LGBT and its Global Other: Performance as Method (TAPS 220M)Interested students must register for TAPS 2200M. MCM 2100L THe Politics of Precariousness and Resilience (POLS 2355)Interested students must register for POLS 2355. MCM 2100M Liveness: Performance and Neoanimism in Late Capitalism (TAPS 2200N)Interested students must register for TAPS 2200N. MCM 2110 - Studies in Textual and Critical TheoryMCM 2110B - Freud and LacanThis course will stress the relations between language, subjectivity and sexuality and the feminist use and/or critique of psychoanalytic concepts. Familiarity with semiotic and poststructuralist theory required. Additional readings in Laplanche, Weber, Zizek, Gallop, Butler.MCM 2110E - The Reading Effect and the Persistence of Form (ENGL 2900M)Interested students must register for ENGL 2900M S01 (CRN 17317).MCM 2110F The Plasticity of FormCultural and literary studies have increasingly engaged with the question of the aesthetic and, as a consequence, with the problematics of reading, spectatorship and the user that emerges in new media. Our course will approach the articulation of subject and object at stake in these questions through the category of form. We will examine historical conceptualizations of form in various disciplines along with contemporary efforts to think form in critical, rhetorical, dynamic, interactive, and rhizomatic modes: to think the plasticity of form. Readings will range from Williams, Deleuze and Mulvey to Jacques Rancière and Catherine Malabou. Enrollment limited to 20 graduate students. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor permission.  MCM 2110G "This is what you were born for": Optimism and Futurity (ENGL 2561F)Interested students must register for ENGL 2561F.MCM 2110H Deleuze, Rancière, Literature, Film: The Logic of Connection (ENGL 2900S)Interested students must register for ENGL 2900S. MCM 2110I Forms of Reading in the Wake of Humanities (ENGL 2900U)Interested students must register for ENGL 2900U. MCM 2110J Wordliness and Hannah ArendtOn the 50th anniversary of Eichmann in Jerusalem, this seminar asks: How did Hannah Arendt's experience as a Jewish refugee from Hitler's Germany shape her democratic theory? Do her democratic theory and suggestive category worldliness provide a distinctive way to look at post-Holocaust diasporic conditions? We review main categories of political philosophy such as state, sovereignty, nation, violence, vulnerability and power, also using Butler, Kafka and more. Enrollment limited to 15 graduate students.  MCM 2120 - Studies in Media TheoryMCM 2120A - Media ArchaeologyProvides an intellectual history of "Media Archaeology," focusing on contributions by the "SophienstraBe" departments of Humboldt University in Berlin and on the importance of Marshall McLuhan and Michel Foucault, amongst others, to its development. Readings by Friedrich Kittler, Wolfgang Erst, Cornelia Vismann.MCM 2120B - New Media TheoryAn interdisciplinary investigation of "New Media Theory," bringing together historically significant texts from the fields of media, film, literary, music, visual, HCI and cultural studies, with more recent texts in new media studies. As well as exposing students to the canon (from hypertext theory to software studies, HCI to media archaeology), the course will also address the question: what is at stake in the creation of this canon and this discipline? Preferences given to Seniors and Graduate Students in Modern Culture and Media, Art-Semiotics, Modern Culture and Media-German, Modern Culture and Media-Italian, Semiotics-French, English, Comparative Literature, German, Literary Arts, Music, and Science and Technology Studies. All others seek permission from the instructor.MCM 2120C - Cinema, State Violence and the GlobalTheoretical and political conceptions of state and global violence posed against the theory and history of cinema, as representational apparatus and as instruction. Special attention to the establishment of film as global medium around World War I; current issues around the global, state, and biopower; "postmodern media culture;" etc. Readings from sociopolitical theorists (e.g. Weber, Schmitt, Arendt, Foucault, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, etc.) and media scholars/theorists (e.g. Virillio, Prince, L. Williams, Miller, etc.) Enrollment limited to 20. Permission required for undergraduates only.MCM 2120D - Derrida and TelecommunicationsDerrida famously proclaimed that writing preceded speech--rendering all communications a form of writing--but he also argued that the history of psychoanalysis would have been different if Freud had used e-instead of snail-mail. Tracing Derrida's thought re. telecommunications from Grammatology to Writing Machines, as well as engaging his interlocutors (Samuel Weber, Avital Ronell, etc.), this course examines the importance of medium-specificity to post-structuralism. Enrollment limited to 20 graduate students. Permission required for undergraduates only.MCM 2120E - Cinema, Media Culture and Political Theory: Rancière and OthersThere is a strand of contemporary thinkers concerned with political theory, in whose writings media and especially film play significant roles. Jacques Rancière has produced a major body of work on political theory, on aesthetics, and on film as well as media culture. This class will focus on a close examination of his political theory, his conceptions of film and media, and relations between the two fields in his writings. For comparison, we will also look at smaller samples of texts on political theory and film drawn from figures such as Agamben, Badiou, Jameson, etc. Enrollment limited to 20. This class is for Graduates only. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor permission.MCM 2120F - Concepts of Space and Time in Media Discourses (HMAN 2970C)Interested students must register for HMAN 2970C S01.MCM 2120G - Film and Philsophy after DeleuzeExamining the recent but still expanding interest of major contemporary philosophers in the cinema and the corresponding interest of film scholars in contemporary philosophy, the seminar assesses the impact and aftermath of Gilles Deleuze's ground-establishing intervention in the mid-1980s on Cinema Studies. The seminar will include consideration of include Stanley Cavell, Jacques Ranciere, Alain Badiou, Jean Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben among others. A prior working acquaintance with Deleuze’s Cinema books is advisable. Enrollment limited to 20. This course is for Graduates only. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor's permission. MCM 2300 - Studies in Styles, Movements, and GenresMCM 2300A - Real TVThis course will investigate the construction of reality on U.S. television, considering not only specific reality genres (news and "magazine" programs, crisis coverage, docudrama, talk and game shows) but the discursive and representational modes that define the "reality" of commercial television as a whole. Issues include: "liveness"; social relevancy"; therapeutic discourse; TV personalities; media simulation; independent television; and new technologies/realisms.MCM 2300B - Television, Gender and SexualityThis course investigates how television produces and reproduces constructions of gender and sexuality through its institutional form (as it maps relations between the public and the private, the domestic and the social, the inside and the outside), narrative patterns (as it circulates family romances, links gender and genre, and mediates sexual and social tensions), and spectatorial relations (as it variously addresses viewers as sexed and gendered subjects, consumers and commodities, familial and defamiliarized viewers). Enrollment limited to 20. Preference given to graduate students, and then to seniors and juniors in Modern Culture & Media, Art- Semiotics, MCM-German, MCM-Italian, Semiotics French and Gender and Sexuality Studies. Instructors permission required for all undergraduate students. Interested students who cannot pre-register should come to the first day of class to fill out an application for admission.MCM 2300C - After Postmodernism: New Fictional Modes (ENGL 2760X)Interested students must register for ENGL 2760X S01.MCM 2300D - Historicism/Photographic Media: From Kracauer and Benjamin to the DEFA Documentary (GRMN 2660H)Interested students must register for GRMN 2660H S01.MCM 2300E - Things Not Entirely Possessed: Romanticism and History (ENGL 2561B)Interested students must register for ENGL 2561B S01 (CRN 16829).MCM 2300F AnimationThe course focuses on the notion of animation as a general concept. This includes more than just the genre of animation films. We will start with an introduction into the tradition of the notion of 'livelihood' and the concept of the soul (e.g. anima): How is the spectator animated by film? Further we will proceed to texts that are discussing anthropological meanings of animation in the sense of animism. The main focus will then be on the discussion of general concepts of film as medium of animation per se and on different procedures of animating of and in film. Enrollment limited to 20.  MCM 2300G Collaboration and the Event of PhotographyThis course will question the concept of "collaboration" through a variety of moments and projects of collaboration between photographers, photographed persons and spectators that take place in different political contexts. Collaboration is a form of relation that may be idyllic or problematic, liberating or coercive, generating knowledge or disseminating ignorance, empowering or intimidating, involving assistance and solidarity as much as abuse; it may take place among friends or between enemies, and it may create friendship as much as it may complicate it. Reviewing this spectrum of possibilities we shall ask how collaboration informs and transforms the event of photography. Enrollment limited to 15 graduate students. Upperclass undergraduates require instructor permission. Students must register for the primary meeting and one film screening.  MCM 2310 - Studies in Textual FormationsMCM 2310C - Eisenstein and Political ModernismEisenstein's theories and films are a formative moment in cinema and media history, bringing together the ambitions of politicized film and modernist aesthetics. From the first, they were invoked by a range of radical theorists and filmmakers all the way from Brecht and Benjamin to Metz and Deleuze, as well as a variety of filmmaking practices such as militant documentary, third cinema and Godard. In this seminar, we will intensively study Eisenstein's theories, filmic practices and shifting historical contexts, from the heady days of the politically and aesthetically avant-garde 1920s, through the transformations of his theories in the 1930s and 1940s (many only available posthumously) and of his later film projects (several unfinished). We will also trace out some filiations and rereadings of Eisenstein within the history of politically conversant modernist film practices and theories. Permission required for undergraduates only; undergraduates seeking permission must attend the first class session.MCM 2310D - The Idea of a MediumWhat is a "medium" (a term we often seem to take for granted)? An examination of issues of medium specificity, intermediality, convergence, formalism and the idea of a "post-medium era," in relation to the media of print, photography, film, television, and digital media. We will also investigate the role of the museum and alternative screening or exhibition spaces as well as "virtual space" in delineating reception of the media. Enrollment limited to 20. Primarily for MCM graduate students; other qualified graduate students and MCM seniors must obtain permission after the first class. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 2310E - TV Space and TimeExplores television's temporal and spatial construction, considering how television demarcates time (regulating it through flow and segmentation, articulating work and leisure times, marking familial and national events, encouraging rhythms of reception) and space (mapping public and private space, defining a "global media culture" through local viewings, representing and enacting travel and exchange, creating imaginary geographies and communities). Enrollment limited to 20. Preferences given to graduate students. All others seek permission from the instructor. Students MUST register for the lecture section and the screening.MCM 2310G - Cultural Studies and the Problem of FormThis course examines the emergence and contemporary practice of "cultural studies" with a focus on concepts of form. We will consider cultural studies critiques of disciplines, canons, and the aesthetic; the politics of form; theories of reading and spectatorship; "popular" and "mass" forms; and competing definitions of culture as form arising in fields from visual and media studies to postcoloniality and queer theory. Readings from Williams, Hall, Mulvey, Althusser, Spivak, Deleuze, Hartman, Agamben, Sedgwick, Galloway. Instructor permission required. All students seeking permission must attend first class.MCM 2310H - Television RealitiesHow does television bring "real" events to us? How do we define or know what's "real"? What kinds of "realities" exist on television, and how do they operate (in relationship to one another, to TV fantasy, to social structures, and to our everyday lives)? This course will consider not only some specific "reality genres" (news, catastrophe coverage, "live" and "historical" programs, "surveillance programming," documentary and docudrama, talk and game shows, reality series and "docu-soaps") but the representational modes that define the reality of commercial television as a whole. Enrollment limited to 20 graduate students. Permission required for undergraduates only.MCM 2310I - At the Limits: Media Representation of the HolocaustThe Holocaust has been described as unimaginable, at the limits of representation. Yet there have been numerous attempts to imagine and represent it, across media (film, television, graphic novels), genres (documentary, melodrama, comedy, fantasy), and modalities (through history and memory, "high" and "low" culture, fiction and nonfiction, reporting and marketing).

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Ph.D. program prepares students to engage in rigorous and innovative scholarship and teaching in the theory, history and critical analysis of one or more media, in ways that encompass diverse cultural contexts and historical periods, and within methodological frameworks that include awareness of modern and contemporary textual, cultural and social theory.Plans of study are individualized, based on the student's own particular areas of interest. Students may emphasize the scholarship of one medium or of several media and their interrelationships, but their coursework and exams will also include a component in textual, cultural, and/or social theory. This combination affords students an intellectually expansive perspective, enhancing both disciplinary depth and interdisciplinary flexibility.For students entering the program with a B.A., courses are normally completed in the first three years of the program — six courses are taken in the first year, four in the second year and three in the third year. During this period, the student also fulfils the foreign language requirement. After completion of 8 courses in the second year, there is a qualifying review, and the candidate is awarded an M.A. in Modern Culture and Media. After completion of all coursework in the third year, the candidate takes a three-hour oral preliminary examination. Passing the preliminary examination authorizes her or him to proceed to the doctoral dissertation, which is written during the fourth and fifth years.Students entering the program with an M.A. from another institution take courses at the same rate as those entering with a B.A. Such students may apply to accelerate their coursework and, if they receive approval, may take their preliminary examination as early as the end of the fourth semester. Students entering with an M.A. will have their qualifying review after they have completed 6 courses, which is normally at the end of the second semester.Teaching is considered a vital part of graduate education in this program. We believe that a variety of pedagogical experiences not only contributes to the candidate's professional qualifications but also to her or his intellectual development. A minimum of two years of teaching is required for the degree, but a doctoral student will normally teach more. A candidate typically begins holding a teaching assistant position in a large introductory course during the second year in the program and continues teaching in various classroom contexts through the fifth year. We try to provide all senior doctoral candidates with at least one opportunity to teach a small, autonomous class on a subject directly related to their dissertation research. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownUnfortunately, we cannot interview prospective applicants, nor do we schedule individual visits; there would simply be too many for us to handle during a busy school year. (We do encourage and support visits once someone is admitted, so that the person can make an informed decision about whether to accept our offer.) You are free to meet with any faculty, including the Director of Graduate Studies, during their regular office hours, which are posted on the department website. (This academic year (2017/18) the Director of Graduate Studies is Ellen Rooney, whose regular office hours are TBD. You can also call during that time at 401-863-2152. We do advise you to check with any faculty members before showing up, to be sure there will be no change in their schedules for that week. You may also want to e-mail the Director of Graduate Studies with questions at Ellen_Rooney@brown.edu.The Graduate Admission Committee weighs a number of factors when considering candidates. The admission committee places great importance on a candidate's personal statement and writing sample. These pieces of writing must show, first of all, that the applicant would like to be a part of and is capable of succeeding in a graduate program whose goal is to train students to produce significant scholarly work in media studies and cultural theory. We look for applicants who are asking provocative questions about the media and their relation to larger cultural and theoretical issues and who are interested in pursuing these questions in a rigorous intellectual environment. The personal statement and writing sample must also demonstrate that the candidate would fit in well with our program's strengths. Third, they must show that the candidate has the skills and abilities required for those who are to be trained in film, media and cultural studies. Obviously, a candidate's undergraduate and -- if applicable -- graduate record is also very important in determining admission, as are test scores and letters of recommendation.Applicants to the program should submit the application, 3 letters of recommendation, personal statement, writing sample transcripts, and GRE General Aptitude Test scores. The TOEFL test is required for foreign applicants, except those who hold (or will receive) a degree from an institution where the language of instruction is English.The Personal Statement should give the committee a sense of your interests and academic accomplishments and what you have studied and why at the undergraduate and/or M.A. levels. It should outline in general the aspects of Modern Culture and Media you would like to emphasize and any particular or more specialized questions you would like to pursue at the graduate level.We have no official requirement regarding the length of the writing sample. We ask that you send us a piece of your writing so that we can determine from this material if you have the necessary skills to succeed as a graduate student in Modern Culture and Media and, ultimately, a professional media and cultural theory scholar at a major university. Such skills would include an ability to produce a challenging and focused argument about some aspect of media and culture. Twenty-five pages would not be too much to send. On the other hand, a four-five page analytical paper would be far too short. Most applicants submit the equivalent of a term paper or seminar paper. You may also submit a chapter or chapters from an Honors Thesis, or a chapter from an M.A. thesis, perhaps with a brief introduction explaining the nature of the thesis as a whole. We do recognize that some applicants may not have had the opportunity to produce work in such formats, and they sometimes submit two or three shorter papers. Whatever you send, we strongly recommend that you seek the counsel of a faculty member at your present school (if you are currently attending one) or one of your previous institutions who has some familiarity with the current state of film and media studies and cultural theory.The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required and should be taken well in advance of the application deadlineWe do not have minimum GRE scores. GRE scores are just one element of the application package, which includes some quantitative elements (GPAs, GREs) but also a large number of important qualitative elements (letters of recommendation, writing sample, personal statement, etc.) We compare applicants on the basis of the total package, as opposed to weighting any single element of it. We attempt to judge the "fit" between the applicant’s interests and our program, the likelihood of success in our program, and the potential for cutting-edge scholarship in the future.Yes, we do admit students directly from undergraduate programs. Speaking abstractly, any undergraduate major is acceptable, if the applicant has a way of showing good potential in fields of interest to us. Naturally, the majority of our students have undergrad majors in areas like film or media or cultural studies and the like. We have admitted students with B.A.’s in East Asian Studies, in English, in Art History, as well as in Film and Media Studies.Yes. Brown University requires this exam, except for those who hold (or will receive) a degree from an institution where the language of instruction is English. At Brown, TOEFL requirements are set by the Graduate School, not the individual department, and the Graduate School administers the collection of application materials. Therefore, any questions about waivers should be addressed to the Graduate School.NoBrown offers five years of guaranteed support. First-year students are on fellowship. Students in their second and third years work as TAs (one course per semester), leading a discussion section of a large lecture. Students in their fourth year design and teach their own section of MCM 0900 “Undergraduate Seminars in Modern Culture and Media.” Students in their fifth year usually are supported through a combination of TAships (again, one course per semester) and university fellowships.International graduate students are funded in exactly the same way as American students. If you are admitted to the program, you will receive 5 years of funding through fellowships and teaching assistantships.We prefer writing samples to be submitted with your online application.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown1) Preparation for Candidacy2) Advancement to Candidacy3) Writing the DissertationWelcome to the Ph.D. program in Modern Culture and Media. This handbook is intended to present a clear set of guidelines and expectations for the program, to answer some of the most frequently asked questions before they are asked, and to help students at all stages plan their individual experience of the program effectively. However, no such written guide can foresee every programmatic, administrative, or scholarly detail that might arise. Furthermore, plans of study in the program are individualized, and distinctive scholarly combinations are possible. So while this handbook provides a framework, you will also find it useful to consult actively and consistently and with your faculty advisor, department staff, and fellow graduate students throughout your time in the program. More generally, you are urged to engage in regular and collegial conversation with MCM faculty and graduate students.It is every student’s responsibility to be aware of the contents of this handbook, and to consult it from time to time when questions or problems arise, and/or when preparing for the next stage of the program. Because MCM faculty and the profession itself are continually changing, these guidelines may be revised on a regular basis. When changes have been approved, they will be introduced as quickly as possible.(top)Your principal initial contacts at MCM are the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), the Department Manager, Susan McNeil, and the Program Coordinator, Liza Hebert. Susan McNeil and Liza Hebert are in the Department office. Introduce yourself to them when you arrive on campus. They will be helping you with the administrative and bureaucratic niceties of being a graduate student during your years here, and they know a lot about how the Department and the program works. Also, immediately upon your arrival on campus, let the DGS know that you are in town and schedule an appointment to discuss your program and any other matters of concern to you at that point. The DGS will be an important person for you. In addition to being your first academic advisor, the DGS chairs the department’s faculty Graduate Committee, which oversees graduate program policy and may be the decision-making body for any special questions or ambiguities affecting you. During your time in MCM, the DGS may be involved with you on a number of important matters, ranging from how you fulfill course and language requirements to teaching assignments and the makeup of your Preliminary Examination and dissertation committees. The Department Graduate Committee is composed of MCM Faculty and one graduate student representative.For the 2017-18 academic year, the DGS is Professor Ellen Rooney.(top)Academic/Social: Every university is different, and MCM is a distinctive program. It may also be that the resources here differ significantly from those of your undergraduate or M.A.-granting institution. As you will see below, you will take 6 of the required 13 courses your first year in the program, and by the end of the second year (or earlier for those arriving with an M.A.) you already have to begin thinking about a Preliminary Examination Committee. You should use your first year as an opportunity to get to know the modes of research and criticism on offer in MCM, as well as the individual faculty members practicing them. The best way to do that is to take courses from a variety of MCM faculty. You may also find that graduate work requires you to change ways of reading texts, kinds of writing, and the research methods with which you are already familiar. Consider what kinds of scholarship available in the Department are especially pertinent to your interests, but also be on the lookout for unexpected directions that enrich your original concerns. In early September, MCM throws a fall party to celebrate the beginning of the new academic year. You are strongly encouraged to use this and any other opportunity to become acquainted with faculty, staff, and graduate and undergraduate students in the Department. More generally, a truism of doctoral education is that social scholarship – informal discussion and collaboration with one’s fellow graduate students – makes a central contribution. Enjoy and benefit from the presence of your peers. General Note on Courses and “Shopping”: The approximately two-week-long period between the beginning of classes and the deadline for course registration without a late fee each term (see the Academic Calendar) is known colloquially at Brown as the “shopping period.” Traditionally during this period, many Brown students sample a variety of courses before making a final decision about which ones they (agreement with “Brown Students”) will commit to for the semester. This can be a useful process for you, but there are some things to keep in mind. Though faculty members sometimes adjust their syllabi to account for early-term shoppers, be somewhat cautious about shopping, as keeping current with extra upper-level classes can be overwhelming, even for the short, two-week shopping period. Also, be sure to register for your full load of classes before the shopping period. Faculty are under no obligation to enroll shoppers, and many courses are overenrolled in pre-registration. If you decide to change a course and the professor agrees to allow you into the class, you can then change your schedule easily through the standard drop-add process. Finally, discuss any course changes with your advisor, the DGS, before finalizing them. Brown has a new on-line course registration system called Banner. You will now use the on-line banner system to register for courses (http://brown.edu/web/intranet/banner/) The Graduate Student Council (GSC) is the primary political and social voice of graduate students from all departments. The GSC holds various activities and social events throughout the academic year and the summer. While Brown is a lively and active community, Providence itself also has a thriving local arts, film, and music scene. You are encouraged to explore events and facilities outside of the Brown community, for example at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and at local concert, cinema, and gallery spaces such as AS220 (115 Empire St.), Tazza (250 Westminster St., downtown), the Avon Cinema (260 Thayer St.), and the Cable Car Cinema and Café (204 S. Main St.) among others. TheProvidence Phoenix publishes listings in the manner of the Village Voice.Boston, New York, and Newport, RI are also easily accessible by various forms of public transportation. See the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Bonanza Bus Lines, Greyhound, Amtrak, and the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) for details.Housing: The Brown Office of Rental Facilities maintains a list of housing opportunities both on and off campus. Other good sources for housing include the Brown Daily Jolt Housing Forum, Craigslist Providence, The Providence Journal’s Classifieds Section, the Providence Phoenix’s Classifieds Section, the Brown Graduate Student ListServ (subscribe here) and postings at local cafés such as the Cable Car Cinema and Café (204 S. Main St.), The Edge (201 Wayland Ave.) on Providence’s East Side, and White Electric Coffee (711 Westminster St.) on the West Side. The rental market in Providence can be a challenging one, and choosing among the city’s many diverse neighborhoods can be difficult. Other graduate students and some faculty can provide you with useful advice.(top)The Department of Modern Culture and Media (MCM) is concerned with the study of media of technical reproduction whose historical appearance has characterized modernity – film, video, digital media, photography, sound, and print insofar as it is connected to mass dissemination. These are not understood in a narrow sense, for a departmental premise is the centrality of media to all modern and contemporary cultural practices. Thus, in MCM “media” are conceived in conjunction with modern cultural and social histories and networks, and vice-versa. The Department is further committed to a range of modern and contemporary cultural, social and textual theories that bear on cultural production and reception and their histories.The Department offers a graduate program in Modern Culture and Media, which is the main concern of this handbook. Our graduate program is a Ph.D. program. Doctoral candidates who do not enter the program with an M.A. earn one on their way to the Ph.D. There is no stand-alone, terminal M.A. program for those applying to the program from other universities. The Ph.D. in Modern Culture and Media is aimed at: (1) Preparing students to engage in rigorous scholarship and teaching in the theory, history, and critical analysis of one of more media, in ways that encompass diverse cultural contexts, practices, and historical periods, within a methodological framework that includes awareness of modern textual, cultural, and social theory; (2) Preparing students to seek academic positions in a market that increasingly offers positions to media and culture specialists both in identifiable media disciplinary units (e.g., Film Studies, Television Studies, Media Studies, etc.); in units with newer labels such as Cultural Studies, Visual Studies, Comparative Media, New Media, and so forth; and also in other kinds of programs which may have expanded concerns (e.g., certain English, Foreign Language, and Comparative Literature Departments).Mission Statement of the Department.(top)There are three major stages to your work in the program: 1) Preparation for Candidacy, which includes Coursework, the Qualifying Review and fulfilling the Foreign Language Requirement; 2) Advancement to Candidacy, which includes the Preliminary Examination and writing an approved Dissertation Proposal; and 3) Writing the dissertation in completion of the degree.(top) 1. At least 13 courses taken while a graduate student are required of doctoral students. One media production course may count toward this total. Plans of study are individualized. You will choose courses in consultation with your DGS, based on your scholarly and teaching interests. At Brown, 2000-level courses are designated as graduate courses, while 1000-level courses are designated as upper-level undergraduate courses that may also be taken for graduate credit. Courses numbered below 1000 may not count for graduate credit or towards the degree. It is also possible to organize individual and group independent study projects with MCM faculty, but of course this depends on the availability of individual faculty, the constraints on their time, and their interests. The rubric MCM 2980: Independent Reading and Research in Modern Culture and Media is reserved for such projects. 2. Students entering the program with a B.A. in hand normally take 6 courses in the first year, 4 courses in the second year, and 3 courses in the third year. Students entering the program with an M.A. take courses at the same rate as those entering with a B.A. However, after arriving on campus such students may apply to accelerate their coursework. In such cases they may complete their coursework as early as the end of the fourth semester.3. Among these 13 courses, students are required to take at least one graduate level course (i.e., course number 2000 or higher) offered by MCM in each of the following three areas:*Theory (a course in theories of textuality, subjectivity, culture, the social and/or a specific medium in relation to any of these.) Normally fulfilled by one of the following: MCM 2100, MCM 2110, MCM 2120.*Textual Analysis (a course that addresses a single medium or genre conceived as a textual object, a mode of cultural production, or a form.) Normally fulfilled by one of the following: MCM 2300, MCM 2310.*Historical/Cultural Locations (a course that assists students in understanding how the production, circulation, and reception of media forms operate within and across specific social contexts, periods, geocultural sites, and/or communities.) Normally fulfilled by one of the following: MCM 2500, MCM 2510.First year students will receive an evaluation of their work from the DGS after their first and second semesters. All other students will receive an annual evaluation of their progress toward the degree.(top) Upon successful completion of 8 courses (6 for those entering with an M.A.), students will be subject to a qualifying review, administered by a Qualifying Review Committee of three faculty on the Department Graduate Committee. The Qualifying Review Committee is formed by the Director of Graduate Studies. It will consist of the Director of Graduate Studies, one Graduate Committee member with research and/or teaching specialities overlap with those of the students, and one Graduate Committee member with other research and/or teaching specialities. The Qualifying Review Committee will review the student's progress, reports by instructors, and a sample of work submitted by the student (normally a seminar paper). It will then meet with the student for 90 minutes, which will give the student the opportunity to communicate with the committee.The substance of this meeting will be both retrospective and prospective: retrospective in that the meeting will include discussion of your work at Brown to this point and how you see yourself in the program, and prospective in that it will include discussion of your future directions. The latter will include discussions of possibilities for the establishment of Preliminary Examination fields.The Qualifying Review Committee will then make one of the following decisions for students who entered the program with a B.A.: (a) award of an M.A. and a determination that the student may proceed towards advanced candidacy; or (b) award of a terminal M.A. Students who enter the program with an M.A. in hand will be subject to the qualifying review after completing 6 courses. In such cases, the Qualifying Review Committee decision will either (a) a determination that the student proceed towards advanced candidacy; or (b) termination of studies.Students are required to demonstrate reading and research competency in one foreign language. Additional languages may be required of individual students based on their research interests. This requirement may be met by one of the following methods:1) Passing a translation exam administered by MCM faculty or qualified faculty in other departments. 2) Earning a grade of B or better in a 1000-level or higher course offered by a foreign language department, for which the professor attests that teaching and reading assignments were preponderantly in that language. (This course will count towards the 13 required courses only if its content coheres with the student’s scholarly interests.)3) Passing a graduate level reading course offered by a Foreign Language Department.Summer Foreign Language reading courses are offered by Brown for graduate students. You should satisfy the foreign language requirement as early as possible in your program. In no case will a student be allowed to take the Preliminary Exam without satisfying this requirement.(top)A minimum of two years of teaching experience is also required for the degree. See the section on teaching below.(top)Virtually all doctoral programs require some form of a general examination after the completion of a student's coursework. This is the point of the Preliminary Examination. It is a culminating moment in your studies. It asks you to demonstrate conceptual as well as bibliographical control over a range of scholarly interests and areas in which you plan to do research and teach. In the lead-up to the exam, you will help to identify those areas. In that sense, this is a moment where you formulate an intellectual self-definition.Students entering the program with a B.A. take the Preliminary Examination at the end of the sixth semester, before Commencement. Students entering the program with an M.A. who are permitted to transfer three credits take it at the end of the fourth semester, before Commencement. Passing this exam authorizes the candidate to proceed with the dissertation proposal. The Qualifying Review, all course requirements, and the foreign language requirement, must be successfully completed before the Preliminary Examination may be taken.It is important not to delay arrangements and preparations for the Preliminary Examination. Since plans of study are individualized in MCM, much of the responsibility for this devolves upon the student. You should begin thinking about Preliminary Exam areas before taking your Qualifying Review, which will include discussion of possible Preliminary Exam areas. No later than October 1, if you complete your qualifying review in the spring, or February 1, if you complete  your qualifying review in the fall, you should establish a faculty Preliminary Exam committee. As explained below, this will normally be three MCM and/or MCM-affiliated faculty. You will begin preparation for the Preliminary Exam by working with committee members to finalize definitions of three exam fields including their bibliographical and media lists. The nature of these fields is also explained below.There are three phases to preparation and completion of the exam: (1) defining the exam fields and constituting a Preliminary Examination committee; (2) preparing and providing materials for the exam in consultation with the committee; and (3) taking the exam before Commencement.1. Defining the fields and constituting a committee: As noted above, by the end of the second year for those entering the program with a B.A. or the end of the first year for those entering with an M.A. who are permitted to transfer three credits, you will have to constitute your faculty committee and define three fields for the Preliminary Exam.The exam committee will consist of at least three faculty members, all of whom should be MCM or MCM-affiliated faculty. You must designate a chairperson of the committee. You will work with committee members in constituting and preparing the three exam fields. Each committee member takes primary responsibility for working with you on one of your fields. It is the student's responsibility to approach faculty and ask if they are willing to serve on the committee. It is also the student’s responsibility to make arrangements to work with committee members to prepare for the exam.Taken together, the three exam fields should delimit academic area(s) in which the student is preparing to teach, as well the scholarly context(s) for the student's projected research. The configuration of the fields for all students will be as follows:*Field 1: in the history and theory of a medium. *Field 2: in modern cultural theory.*Field 3: an elective field that is designed to provide a comparative perspective.2. Materials provided by the student: Before the Preliminary Exam, the student will produce3. The Exam: The Preliminary Examination is a 3-hour oral exam. If the candidate so chooses, the exam may begin with a brief statement concerning the fields essay and preparation for the exam.  This statement is not required and should be no more than three to five minutes in length. The exam covers the Fields Essay and the field bibliographies. It will probe the student's understanding of his or her fields and debates within them. The purpose of the exam will be to establish both the breadth and the depth of the student's competence and knowledge in areas where she or he plans to teach and do research. Upon completion of the exam, the committee will come to one of the following determinations: (a) Pass; or (b) directed to retake the exam. Students may retake the exam once. (top)After passing the preliminary examination, the candidate proceeds to the dissertation proposal. She or he forms a dissertation committee, produces a dissertation proposal, en route to writing the dissertation and finishing the degree.It is the student's responsibility to approach prospective faculty and ask if they are willing to serve on the committee. When the candidate constitutes a dissertation committee, she or he designates one committee member as the dissertation director. The dissertation committee normally consists of three faculty, at least two of whom must be MCM or MCM-affiliated faculty. (In some cases, a candidate may request an additional faculty member – even, in exceptional cases, one from another university – when it is necessary to cover unusual interests or fields pertinent to the dissertation.) The dissertation committee is often the same as the Preliminary Examination committee, but this is not required.The candidate then writes a dissertation proposal in consultation with committee members. The dissertation proposal will indicate the problem(s) or issue(s) as well as the objects of study of concern of the work, the scholarly context and bibliography within which it positions itself, and the organization and structure of the study.The dissertation is generally a book-length study. It must be an original contribution to its fields of concern and meet the highest standards of scholarly competence. Even if you have a firm idea about your dissertation topic, do not assume that you can write the proposal quickly and gain fast approval of your committee. This is probably the first time you have worked on a project of this scale, and your committee will want to ensure that your proposal has intellectual and scholarly depth, range, and significance. It will also be concerned that your conception of the project is practical and doable in a reasonable amount of time.When the candidate and the dissertation director believe the proposal is ready, the committee will hold a dissertation proposal meeting with the candidate. This meeting should take place no later than November 15. The committee will either approve the proposal or recommend revisions. A file copy of the final approved proposal, with a cover sheet signed by all members of the committee, should be provided by the student to the Director of Graduate Studies no later than December 15. (A file of previous dissertation proposals is kept in the MCM Department office. It is available for you to consult.)(top) During work on the dissertation, continued regular consultation with committee members is highly advisable. It is especially crucial that the candidate keep the dissertation director informed of the state of the work. MCM does not require a formal dissertation defense, so all committee members must independently approve the final draft in order to complete the degree.The candidate should be conversant with Graduate School guidelines for dissertations. These include regulations governing the format of the final draft as well as administrative matters that are the responsibility of the candidate. See the Graduate School’s page of rules and regulations for details.(top)The Department only admits doctoral students it can support. While decisions about who to support are those of the Department, the funding actually comes from the Graduate School. Therefore, Graduate School regulations and budgeting govern the administration of this support. MCM doctoral students are awarded a five-year financial support package that consists of a first-year fellowship including tuition and a September-May living stipend (with no teaching responsibilities), followed by three years of teaching assistantships, which include tuition and September-May stipend, and a fifth-year dissertation fellowship (for the Graduate School’s explanation of the relation of graduate student support to tuition requirements, click here). Students also receive four years of summer support. Some candidates do not finish the dissertation until the sixth year.  In these cases, the Department seeks support for sixth-year students from the Graduate School. In addition to the first year fellowship and teaching assistantships, advanced graduate students are eligible for dissertation fellowships.  No one is eligible for a dissertation fellowship until his or her dissertation proposal is approved. In order to be considered for a dissertation fellowship in their fifth year, graduate students should submit a dissertation proposal by December 15 of their fourth year (seventh semester.)Graduate students may also apply for proctorships and fellowships offered by various units within the University, but in most cases it is advisable to gain support from MCM whenever it is available.The Graduate School encourages candidates who have possible sources of support from outside the university. Those who come with outside support or who attain it while at Brown must make the Department and Graduate School aware of it. It may result in modification of the terms of funding from the Graduate School; however, you should end up better off than when you started. It is the policy of the Graduate School that the candidate should not be penalized for obtaining outside support. See the Director of Graduate Studies if any of this pertains to your situation.Graduate Students are also entitled to various forms of travel support for research and conferences. Click here for more information.(top)Teaching is considered a vital part of doctoral education in this program. Experiences of candidates in MCM as well as formal studies conducted across the university by the Graduate School suggest that teaching is an important component of intellectual development and personal satisfaction for Brown graduate students. It is also of benefit on the academic job market.A minimum of two years’ teaching is required for the degree. In practice, most financial aid packages involve more teaching than this. Normally, doctoral students do not teach during their 1st year. They usually serve as teaching assistants during their 2nd and 3rd years. In subsequent years, much of their support is also likely to take the form ofteaching assistantships, depending on the type of funding made available to students and the Department by the Graduate School. The Department tries to provide opportunities for candidates to teach in areas related to their specific interests, but the need to cover courses or broaden the graduate student's teaching experience may affect assignments. Many of the teaching assistantships are in undergraduate core courses. These include MCM 0100: Screens and Projections: Modern Media Cultures, MCM 0150: Text/Media/Culture: Readings in Theory, MCM 0230: Digital Media,MCM 0240: Introduction to the Study of Television, MCM 0250: Visuality and Visual Theories, MCM0260: Cinematic Coding and Narrativity, and MCM1110: Theory of the Sign. Sometimes large enrollments make T.A.’s necessary in other courses such as MCM 1200: Special Topics in Modern Culture and Media. MCM graduate students will most often have their first teaching experience in MCM 0150, whose subject matter makes it an excellent conceptual introduction to teaching in MCM fields. Being a teaching assistant generally entails conducting discussion sections and grading. You may also be asked to give a lecture, in order to broaden your own teaching experience. It is the general practice in MCM for faculty to conduct weekly conferences with their teaching assistants, covering pedagogical goals, objectives, and strategies, course materials, and grading.The Department also tries to provide all doctoral candidates with the opportunity to teach a course of their own, normally under the rubric of MCM 0900: Sophomore Seminars. This ideally occurs in the 4th year of study, but may be later. Since MCM 0900 is a seminar, its subject matter varies with the instructor. You will choose your course topic in conjunction with your advisor, though undergraduate curricular constraints may also have to be considered (for example, a similar or identical course might be planned by a faculty member.) Candidates are strongly encouraged to design a course related to their dissertation area, and to consult with their advisor and other appropriate faculty when designing the course. The course must be approved by the Department, and then the undergraduate College through the College Curriculum Committee (the CCC). Plan ahead. The CCC requires a formal application, which should be made the year before the course is to be taught so that it can be listed in the on-line Banner System. It is best to consult with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Department Administrator about these procedures early in your third year.(top)The Department and the Graduate School consider five years to be the optimum period for completion of all Ph.D. requirements. It is also recognized, however, that for some students an additional year might be necessary. As noted above, financial support in the form of fellowships, proctorships, and teaching assistantships is usually not guaranteed for a sixth year. When a sixth year is necessary to complete the dissertation, a candidate will have to apply for an extra year’s support. Assuming the candidate is making good progress towards completion, the Department will try to support such applications. Candidates should also look into any possibilities for external funding.(top)The following represents ideal progress towards the Ph.D. for those who do not enter the program with an M.A.Fall Semester:  2 coursesSpring Semester: 2 coursesSpring-Summer:Fall Semester: 1 or 2 coursesSpring Semester: Remaining 1 or 2 coursesFall Semester: Successful completion of MCM 0900 courseSpring Semester:Fall Semester: TA or dissertation fellowshipSpring Semester: TA or dissertation fellowshipThe timetable for students entering the program with an M.A. is slightly different. While the pace of coursework is the same as for those entering with a B.A., the candidate may have the third-year courses waived. Since the Preliminary Examination is taken upon completion of coursework, this means that it would be taken a year earlier (at the end of the second year). Everything else is accelerated by a year, including the teaching and funding timetables.In addition, the Qualifying Review will take place after the student has completed 6 courses instead of 8.(top)Graduate School Travel Funds for Presenting Papers at Conferences: The Graduate School makes $500 available to support travel to one conference per year at which the student presents a paper. Although the funding comes from the Graduate School, application for it must be made through MCM well in advance of the conference as it requires the signature of the Director of Graduate Studies. The student will have to submit a travel expense form and all original receipts to the Graduate School after travel is completed. For information and the application form, click here.(top)The Graduate School has negotiated the following exchange arrangements with some of Brown’s peer institutions. MCM students may participate if the exchange permits types of coursework unavailable at Brown, and if that coursework is especially useful for the student’s plan of study. A student should only engage in an exchange arrangement if it is approved by the Director of Graduate Studies.Exchange Scholar Program: After completion of one year at Brown, graduate students are eligible to enroll for one or two semesters in the Graduate Schools of the following universities: University of California at Berkeley, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, MIT, Princeton University, Stanford University, and Yale University. You will continue to pay tuition at Brown. Note that participation in this program may affect your financial support from Brown; for example, if your support is in the form of a teaching assistantship and you cannot fulfill your teaaching responsibilities while studying at the other institution, you will not receive your stipend. Click here for more information from the Graduate School.Cross-Registration at Harvard: There is a long-standing agreement between Harvard and Brown to allow cross-registration of graduate students without paying tuition to the host institution. To do this, you must get the proper forms from the Registrar’s office at each university, and signatures from the director of each Graduate Program and a dean from each Graduate School. If instead of one course you want to take an entire semester’s course work at Harvard, then you need to enroll in the Exchange Scholar Program.(top)The university defines a Traveling Scholar as a graduate student whose research (for example, on a dissertation) requires that he or she must be away from Brown in order to pursue studies full time. The advantages include a very modest registration fee and health insurance support. There is a time limit of one year, though it may be extended in exceptional cases. For more on traveling scholar status, click here.Traveling Scholar status should not be confused with a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence assumes that the candidate is suspending his or her studies. If a student believes he or she may have to suspend studies for any reason, that student should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies as soon as possible. A Leave of Absence should only be taken for the most serious of reasons, and in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. Regulations regarding such leaves, readmission, tuition consequences, and so forth are summarized here.(top)Faculty and Administrative Offices: Most MCM faculty and administrative offices are located at 155 George St. In 2004, MCM expanded into a second building at 135 Thayer St., just around the corner from the first building. The second building houses production facilities, screening rooms, and classrooms.Graduate Student Offices: TA offices are in the basement of 155 George St. Schedule conflicts should not arise due to the offices’ abundant space and sound-reducing cubicles. However, in the case that they do, priority must be given to those using the offices for their TA duties.Mail: Every graduate student is assigned a mailbox in the department office. Significant notices and information from the Department and other university offices such as the Graduate School are sent there, so you should regularly check your mailbox. Mailboxes are located on the first floor of 155 George St.Your Brown mailing address is:  Your NameDepartment of Modern Culture and MediaBrown UniversityBox 1957Providence, RI 02912Building Access: The exterior doors of MCM and the TA offices are on the Card Access system, which means your Brown ID Card is your key. After getting your ID card, you will need to speak to the Department Administrator to arrange card access to the building and offices. Entry to 135 Thayer is limited to those taking or teaching classes in that building. It works through the same Card Access system.Libraries: The main library is the Rockefeller Library (10 Prospect St.), whose holdings include Humanities and Social Sciences. The other large general use library is the Science Library (201 Thayer St.), which includes materials on psychoanalysis, and the history of science and technology among other things. If you wish, you may apply for a carrel assignment in the Rockefeller Library. Ask about this at the circulation desk of the library.Click here for an interactive map of Brown’s libraries.Brown students also have borrowing privileges at the RISD Library (2 College St.). Ask about this at the Rockefeller Library, as the RISD Library requires a letter of introduction from Brown.The Brown library participates in various Ivy League, area, and national library consortium arrangements. Furthermore, interlibrary loan has become quite fast and can sometimes deliver journal articles to you electronically. You should explore the library website and become familiar with these resources.Brown Media Archive: The Brown Media Archive, located at 155 George St., is a constantly expanding pedagogical and research collection of film and television/video materials covering both U.S. and international media. As of this writing, it includes more than 800 16mm film prints, 1400 videotapes, and hundreds of DVDs. It is a significant research resource whose holdings are not open to the general public. MCM’s Media Archivist is Richard Manning. His office is on the first floor of 155 George St. He can be reached at 863-3703.Video Checkout Room: Videos and DVDs from the Archive may be viewed in the Video Checkout Room in the basement of 155 George St. Its academic year hours are Monday-Friday, 9:30 am – 4:30 pm. It is closed during the summer. Smaller classes may be assigned to analyze materials there, so a viewing station may sometimes be unavailable; consult in advance about using it. MCM’s TA offices are also equipped with VCRs and DVD players.Computing: During orientation, Computer and Information Services (CIS) provides an orientation for graduate students, which may well be useful for you. You should be aware of the specific software CIS supports and consider changing to supported word processing, internet browsing and e-mail software if you do not already use it. Many of these programs are available on networked computers such as those in Department offices. Click here for support Information from CIS.Important: No matter what your software, you should establish a NetID and password through CIS as soon as you have your Brown ID card. Your NetID and password are required for using the computer clusters, gaining access to individual information such as grades, and using the Brown library system from off-campus. Activate your account hereThe Malcolm Forbes Center: The Malcolm S. Forbes Center for Media and Culture sponsors conferences and lectures organized by MCM faculty, and research projects associated with the Department. Topics of some conferences that have been sponsored by the Center include: Television and Nationality; Modernism and Modernity; The Archeology of Digital Multi-Media; Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project. The Center has also sponsored or supported several public events that exhibit media texts normally difficult to access in the U.S. Examples include: a festival of Portuguese and Lusophone cinema; a festival of Turkish diaspora cinema in Germany; and annual festivals of French/Francophone cinema, and contemporary African cinema. The Center also supports the Modernist Journals Project, which is constructing fully-searchable online editions of English-language journals and magazines that were important in shaping modes of art and literature that came to be called modernist.Multi-disciplinary resources: MCM has a long history of interdisciplinary collaboration across departmental lines. The Department maintains ties with many other university units, such as the Africana Studies Department, the American Civilization Department, the Comparative Literature Department, the English Department, the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, the Visual Art Department, and others. Depending on their interests and coursework and with the approval of their advisor, candidates may count work in other Brown departments towards their course requirements. Students may include one faculty member from another department on their examination and/or dissertation committees. In addition, other units offer speakers, symposia, exhibits and conferences that are often pertinent to the concerns of MCM graduate students, sometimes with support from MCM.(top)Prof. Lynne JoyrichDepartment ChairLynne_Joyrich@brown.edu(401)863-2382Prof. Ellen RooneyDirector of Graduate StudiesEllen_Rooney@brown.edu(401) 863-2152Susan McNeilDepartment ManagerSusan_McNeil@Brown.edu(401) 863-3535Liza HebertProgram CoordinatorLiza_Hebert@Brown.edu(401) 863-2853TBDFilm and Media Archivist(401) 863-3703(top)  Brown UniversityThe Graduate SchoolDepartment of Modern Culture and MediaRegistrar’s OfficeBrown Online Course Announcement (BOCA)(top)Brown E-mail AccessBrown Daily JoltComputing and Information Sciences (CIS)Brown University LibrariesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown1) Preparation for Candidacy2) Advancement to Candidacy3) Writing the DissertationWelcome to the Ph.D. program in Modern Culture and Media. This handbook is intended to present a clear set of guidelines and expectations for the program, to answer some of the most frequently asked questions before they are asked, and to help students at all stages plan their individual experience of the program effectively. However, no such written guide can foresee every programmatic, administrative, or scholarly detail that might arise. Furthermore, plans of study in the program are individualized, and distinctive scholarly combinations are possible. So while this handbook provides a framework, you will also find it useful to consult actively and consistently and with your faculty advisor, department staff, and fellow graduate students throughout your time in the program. More generally, you are urged to engage in regular and collegial conversation with MCM faculty and graduate students.It is every student’s responsibility to be aware of the contents of this handbook, and to consult it from time to time when questions or problems arise, and/or when preparing for the next stage of the program. Because MCM faculty and the profession itself are continually changing, these guidelines may be revised on a regular basis. When changes have been approved, they will be introduced as quickly as possible.(top)Your principal initial contacts at MCM are the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), the Department Manager, Susan McNeil, and the Program Coordinator, Liza Hebert. Susan McNeil and Liza Hebert are in the Department office. Introduce yourself to them when you arrive on campus. They will be helping you with the administrative and bureaucratic niceties of being a graduate student during your years here, and they know a lot about how the Department and the program works. Also, immediately upon your arrival on campus, let the DGS know that you are in town and schedule an appointment to discuss your program and any other matters of concern to you at that point. The DGS will be an important person for you. In addition to being your first academic advisor, the DGS chairs the department’s faculty Graduate Committee, which oversees graduate program policy and may be the decision-making body for any special questions or ambiguities affecting you. During your time in MCM, the DGS may be involved with you on a number of important matters, ranging from how you fulfill course and language requirements to teaching assignments and the makeup of your Preliminary Examination and dissertation committees. The Department Graduate Committee is composed of MCM Faculty and one graduate student representative.For the 2017-18 academic year, the DGS is Professor Ellen Rooney.(top)Academic/Social: Every university is different, and MCM is a distinctive program. It may also be that the resources here differ significantly from those of your undergraduate or M.A.-granting institution. As you will see below, you will take 6 of the required 13 courses your first year in the program, and by the end of the second year (or earlier for those arriving with an M.A.) you already have to begin thinking about a Preliminary Examination Committee. You should use your first year as an opportunity to get to know the modes of research and criticism on offer in MCM, as well as the individual faculty members practicing them. The best way to do that is to take courses from a variety of MCM faculty. You may also find that graduate work requires you to change ways of reading texts, kinds of writing, and the research methods with which you are already familiar. Consider what kinds of scholarship available in the Department are especially pertinent to your interests, but also be on the lookout for unexpected directions that enrich your original concerns. In early September, MCM throws a fall party to celebrate the beginning of the new academic year. You are strongly encouraged to use this and any other opportunity to become acquainted with faculty, staff, and graduate and undergraduate students in the Department. More generally, a truism of doctoral education is that social scholarship – informal discussion and collaboration with one’s fellow graduate students – makes a central contribution. Enjoy and benefit from the presence of your peers. General Note on Courses and “Shopping”: The approximately two-week-long period between the beginning of classes and the deadline for course registration without a late fee each term (see the Academic Calendar) is known colloquially at Brown as the “shopping period.” Traditionally during this period, many Brown students sample a variety of courses before making a final decision about which ones they (agreement with “Brown Students”) will commit to for the semester. This can be a useful process for you, but there are some things to keep in mind. Though faculty members sometimes adjust their syllabi to account for early-term shoppers, be somewhat cautious about shopping, as keeping current with extra upper-level classes can be overwhelming, even for the short, two-week shopping period. Also, be sure to register for your full load of classes before the shopping period. Faculty are under no obligation to enroll shoppers, and many courses are overenrolled in pre-registration. If you decide to change a course and the professor agrees to allow you into the class, you can then change your schedule easily through the standard drop-add process. Finally, discuss any course changes with your advisor, the DGS, before finalizing them. Brown has a new on-line course registration system called Banner. You will now use the on-line banner system to register for courses (http://brown.edu/web/intranet/banner/) The Graduate Student Council (GSC) is the primary political and social voice of graduate students from all departments. The GSC holds various activities and social events throughout the academic year and the summer. While Brown is a lively and active community, Providence itself also has a thriving local arts, film, and music scene. You are encouraged to explore events and facilities outside of the Brown community, for example at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and at local concert, cinema, and gallery spaces such as AS220 (115 Empire St.), Tazza (250 Westminster St., downtown), the Avon Cinema (260 Thayer St.), and the Cable Car Cinema and Café (204 S. Main St.) among others. TheProvidence Phoenix publishes listings in the manner of the Village Voice.Boston, New York, and Newport, RI are also easily accessible by various forms of public transportation. See the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Bonanza Bus Lines, Greyhound, Amtrak, and the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) for details.Housing: The Brown Office of Rental Facilities maintains a list of housing opportunities both on and off campus. Other good sources for housing include the Brown Daily Jolt Housing Forum, Craigslist Providence, The Providence Journal’s Classifieds Section, the Providence Phoenix’s Classifieds Section, the Brown Graduate Student ListServ (subscribe here) and postings at local cafés such as the Cable Car Cinema and Café (204 S. Main St.), The Edge (201 Wayland Ave.) on Providence’s East Side, and White Electric Coffee (711 Westminster St.) on the West Side. The rental market in Providence can be a challenging one, and choosing among the city’s many diverse neighborhoods can be difficult. Other graduate students and some faculty can provide you with useful advice.(top)The Department of Modern Culture and Media (MCM) is concerned with the study of media of technical reproduction whose historical appearance has characterized modernity – film, video, digital media, photography, sound, and print insofar as it is connected to mass dissemination. These are not understood in a narrow sense, for a departmental premise is the centrality of media to all modern and contemporary cultural practices. Thus, in MCM “media” are conceived in conjunction with modern cultural and social histories and networks, and vice-versa. The Department is further committed to a range of modern and contemporary cultural, social and textual theories that bear on cultural production and reception and their histories.The Department offers a graduate program in Modern Culture and Media, which is the main concern of this handbook. Our graduate program is a Ph.D. program. Doctoral candidates who do not enter the program with an M.A. earn one on their way to the Ph.D. There is no stand-alone, terminal M.A. program for those applying to the program from other universities. The Ph.D. in Modern Culture and Media is aimed at: (1) Preparing students to engage in rigorous scholarship and teaching in the theory, history, and critical analysis of one of more media, in ways that encompass diverse cultural contexts, practices, and historical periods, within a methodological framework that includes awareness of modern textual, cultural, and social theory; (2) Preparing students to seek academic positions in a market that increasingly offers positions to media and culture specialists both in identifiable media disciplinary units (e.g., Film Studies, Television Studies, Media Studies, etc.); in units with newer labels such as Cultural Studies, Visual Studies, Comparative Media, New Media, and so forth; and also in other kinds of programs which may have expanded concerns (e.g., certain English, Foreign Language, and Comparative Literature Departments).Mission Statement of the Department.(top)There are three major stages to your work in the program: 1) Preparation for Candidacy, which includes Coursework, the Qualifying Review and fulfilling the Foreign Language Requirement; 2) Advancement to Candidacy, which includes the Preliminary Examination and writing an approved Dissertation Proposal; and 3) Writing the dissertation in completion of the degree.(top) 1. At least 13 courses taken while a graduate student are required of doctoral students. One media production course may count toward this total. Plans of study are individualized. You will choose courses in consultation with your DGS, based on your scholarly and teaching interests. At Brown, 2000-level courses are designated as graduate courses, while 1000-level courses are designated as upper-level undergraduate courses that may also be taken for graduate credit. Courses numbered below 1000 may not count for graduate credit or towards the degree. It is also possible to organize individual and group independent study projects with MCM faculty, but of course this depends on the availability of individual faculty, the constraints on their time, and their interests. The rubric MCM 2980: Independent Reading and Research in Modern Culture and Media is reserved for such projects. 2. Students entering the program with a B.A. in hand normally take 6 courses in the first year, 4 courses in the second year, and 3 courses in the third year. Students entering the program with an M.A. take courses at the same rate as those entering with a B.A. However, after arriving on campus such students may apply to accelerate their coursework. In such cases they may complete their coursework as early as the end of the fourth semester.3. Among these 13 courses, students are required to take at least one graduate level course (i.e., course number 2000 or higher) offered by MCM in each of the following three areas:*Theory (a course in theories of textuality, subjectivity, culture, the social and/or a specific medium in relation to any of these.) Normally fulfilled by one of the following: MCM 2100, MCM 2110, MCM 2120.*Textual Analysis (a course that addresses a single medium or genre conceived as a textual object, a mode of cultural production, or a form.) Normally fulfilled by one of the following: MCM 2300, MCM 2310.*Historical/Cultural Locations (a course that assists students in understanding how the production, circulation, and reception of media forms operate within and across specific social contexts, periods, geocultural sites, and/or communities.) Normally fulfilled by one of the following: MCM 2500, MCM 2510.First year students will receive an evaluation of their work from the DGS after their first and second semesters. All other students will receive an annual evaluation of their progress toward the degree.(top) Upon successful completion of 8 courses (6 for those entering with an M.A.), students will be subject to a qualifying review, administered by a Qualifying Review Committee of three faculty on the Department Graduate Committee. The Qualifying Review Committee is formed by the Director of Graduate Studies. It will consist of the Director of Graduate Studies, one Graduate Committee member with research and/or teaching specialities overlap with those of the students, and one Graduate Committee member with other research and/or teaching specialities. The Qualifying Review Committee will review the student's progress, reports by instructors, and a sample of work submitted by the student (normally a seminar paper). It will then meet with the student for 90 minutes, which will give the student the opportunity to communicate with the committee.The substance of this meeting will be both retrospective and prospective: retrospective in that the meeting will include discussion of your work at Brown to this point and how you see yourself in the program, and prospective in that it will include discussion of your future directions. The latter will include discussions of possibilities for the establishment of Preliminary Examination fields.The Qualifying Review Committee will then make one of the following decisions for students who entered the program with a B.A.: (a) award of an M.A. and a determination that the student may proceed towards advanced candidacy; or (b) award of a terminal M.A. Students who enter the program with an M.A. in hand will be subject to the qualifying review after completing 6 courses. In such cases, the Qualifying Review Committee decision will either (a) a determination that the student proceed towards advanced candidacy; or (b) termination of studies.Students are required to demonstrate reading and research competency in one foreign language. Additional languages may be required of individual students based on their research interests. This requirement may be met by one of the following methods:1) Passing a translation exam administered by MCM faculty or qualified faculty in other departments. 2) Earning a grade of B or better in a 1000-level or higher course offered by a foreign language department, for which the professor attests that teaching and reading assignments were preponderantly in that language. (This course will count towards the 13 required courses only if its content coheres with the student’s scholarly interests.)3) Passing a graduate level reading course offered by a Foreign Language Department.Summer Foreign Language reading courses are offered by Brown for graduate students. You should satisfy the foreign language requirement as early as possible in your program. In no case will a student be allowed to take the Preliminary Exam without satisfying this requirement.(top)A minimum of two years of teaching experience is also required for the degree. See the section on teaching below.(top)Virtually all doctoral programs require some form of a general examination after the completion of a student's coursework. This is the point of the Preliminary Examination. It is a culminating moment in your studies. It asks you to demonstrate conceptual as well as bibliographical control over a range of scholarly interests and areas in which you plan to do research and teach. In the lead-up to the exam, you will help to identify those areas. In that sense, this is a moment where you formulate an intellectual self-definition.Students entering the program with a B.A. take the Preliminary Examination at the end of the sixth semester, before Commencement. Students entering the program with an M.A. who are permitted to transfer three credits take it at the end of the fourth semester, before Commencement. Passing this exam authorizes the candidate to proceed with the dissertation proposal. The Qualifying Review, all course requirements, and the foreign language requirement, must be successfully completed before the Preliminary Examination may be taken.It is important not to delay arrangements and preparations for the Preliminary Examination. Since plans of study are individualized in MCM, much of the responsibility for this devolves upon the student. You should begin thinking about Preliminary Exam areas before taking your Qualifying Review, which will include discussion of possible Preliminary Exam areas. No later than October 1, if you complete your qualifying review in the spring, or February 1, if you complete  your qualifying review in the fall, you should establish a faculty Preliminary Exam committee. As explained below, this will normally be three MCM and/or MCM-affiliated faculty. You will begin preparation for the Preliminary Exam by working with committee members to finalize definitions of three exam fields including their bibliographical and media lists. The nature of these fields is also explained below.There are three phases to preparation and completion of the exam: (1) defining the exam fields and constituting a Preliminary Examination committee; (2) preparing and providing materials for the exam in consultation with the committee; and (3) taking the exam before Commencement.1. Defining the fields and constituting a committee: As noted above, by the end of the second year for those entering the program with a B.A. or the end of the first year for those entering with an M.A. who are permitted to transfer three credits, you will have to constitute your faculty committee and define three fields for the Preliminary Exam.The exam committee will consist of at least three faculty members, all of whom should be MCM or MCM-affiliated faculty. You must designate a chairperson of the committee. You will work with committee members in constituting and preparing the three exam fields. Each committee member takes primary responsibility for working with you on one of your fields. It is the student's responsibility to approach faculty and ask if they are willing to serve on the committee. It is also the student’s responsibility to make arrangements to work with committee members to prepare for the exam.Taken together, the three exam fields should delimit academic area(s) in which the student is preparing to teach, as well the scholarly context(s) for the student's projected research. The configuration of the fields for all students will be as follows:*Field 1: in the history and theory of a medium. *Field 2: in modern cultural theory.*Field 3: an elective field that is designed to provide a comparative perspective.2. Materials provided by the student: Before the Preliminary Exam, the student will produce3. The Exam: The Preliminary Examination is a 3-hour oral exam. If the candidate so chooses, the exam may begin with a brief statement concerning the fields essay and preparation for the exam.  This statement is not required and should be no more than three to five minutes in length. The exam covers the Fields Essay and the field bibliographies. It will probe the student's understanding of his or her fields and debates within them. The purpose of the exam will be to establish both the breadth and the depth of the student's competence and knowledge in areas where she or he plans to teach and do research. Upon completion of the exam, the committee will come to one of the following determinations: (a) Pass; or (b) directed to retake the exam. Students may retake the exam once. (top)After passing the preliminary examination, the candidate proceeds to the dissertation proposal. She or he forms a dissertation committee, produces a dissertation proposal, en route to writing the dissertation and finishing the degree.It is the student's responsibility to approach prospective faculty and ask if they are willing to serve on the committee. When the candidate constitutes a dissertation committee, she or he designates one committee member as the dissertation director. The dissertation committee normally consists of three faculty, at least two of whom must be MCM or MCM-affiliated faculty. (In some cases, a candidate may request an additional faculty member – even, in exceptional cases, one from another university – when it is necessary to cover unusual interests or fields pertinent to the dissertation.) The dissertation committee is often the same as the Preliminary Examination committee, but this is not required.The candidate then writes a dissertation proposal in consultation with committee members. The dissertation proposal will indicate the problem(s) or issue(s) as well as the objects of study of concern of the work, the scholarly context and bibliography within which it positions itself, and the organization and structure of the study.The dissertation is generally a book-length study. It must be an original contribution to its fields of concern and meet the highest standards of scholarly competence. Even if you have a firm idea about your dissertation topic, do not assume that you can write the proposal quickly and gain fast approval of your committee. This is probably the first time you have worked on a project of this scale, and your committee will want to ensure that your proposal has intellectual and scholarly depth, range, and significance. It will also be concerned that your conception of the project is practical and doable in a reasonable amount of time.When the candidate and the dissertation director believe the proposal is ready, the committee will hold a dissertation proposal meeting with the candidate. This meeting should take place no later than November 15. The committee will either approve the proposal or recommend revisions. A file copy of the final approved proposal, with a cover sheet signed by all members of the committee, should be provided by the student to the Director of Graduate Studies no later than December 15. (A file of previous dissertation proposals is kept in the MCM Department office. It is available for you to consult.)(top) During work on the dissertation, continued regular consultation with committee members is highly advisable. It is especially crucial that the candidate keep the dissertation director informed of the state of the work. MCM does not require a formal dissertation defense, so all committee members must independently approve the final draft in order to complete the degree.The candidate should be conversant with Graduate School guidelines for dissertations. These include regulations governing the format of the final draft as well as administrative matters that are the responsibility of the candidate. See the Graduate School’s page of rules and regulations for details.(top)The Department only admits doctoral students it can support. While decisions about who to support are those of the Department, the funding actually comes from the Graduate School. Therefore, Graduate School regulations and budgeting govern the administration of this support. MCM doctoral students are awarded a five-year financial support package that consists of a first-year fellowship including tuition and a September-May living stipend (with no teaching responsibilities), followed by three years of teaching assistantships, which include tuition and September-May stipend, and a fifth-year dissertation fellowship (for the Graduate School’s explanation of the relation of graduate student support to tuition requirements, click here). Students also receive four years of summer support. Some candidates do not finish the dissertation until the sixth year.  In these cases, the Department seeks support for sixth-year students from the Graduate School. In addition to the first year fellowship and teaching assistantships, advanced graduate students are eligible for dissertation fellowships.  No one is eligible for a dissertation fellowship until his or her dissertation proposal is approved. In order to be considered for a dissertation fellowship in their fifth year, graduate students should submit a dissertation proposal by December 15 of their fourth year (seventh semester.)Graduate students may also apply for proctorships and fellowships offered by various units within the University, but in most cases it is advisable to gain support from MCM whenever it is available.The Graduate School encourages candidates who have possible sources of support from outside the university. Those who come with outside support or who attain it while at Brown must make the Department and Graduate School aware of it. It may result in modification of the terms of funding from the Graduate School; however, you should end up better off than when you started. It is the policy of the Graduate School that the candidate should not be penalized for obtaining outside support. See the Director of Graduate Studies if any of this pertains to your situation.Graduate Students are also entitled to various forms of travel support for research and conferences. Click here for more information.(top)Teaching is considered a vital part of doctoral education in this program. Experiences of candidates in MCM as well as formal studies conducted across the university by the Graduate School suggest that teaching is an important component of intellectual development and personal satisfaction for Brown graduate students. It is also of benefit on the academic job market.A minimum of two years’ teaching is required for the degree. In practice, most financial aid packages involve more teaching than this. Normally, doctoral students do not teach during their 1st year. They usually serve as teaching assistants during their 2nd and 3rd years. In subsequent years, much of their support is also likely to take the form ofteaching assistantships, depending on the type of funding made available to students and the Department by the Graduate School. The Department tries to provide opportunities for candidates to teach in areas related to their specific interests, but the need to cover courses or broaden the graduate student's teaching experience may affect assignments. Many of the teaching assistantships are in undergraduate core courses. These include MCM 0100: Screens and Projections: Modern Media Cultures, MCM 0150: Text/Media/Culture: Readings in Theory, MCM 0230: Digital Media,MCM 0240: Introduction to the Study of Television, MCM 0250: Visuality and Visual Theories, MCM0260: Cinematic Coding and Narrativity, and MCM1110: Theory of the Sign. Sometimes large enrollments make T.A.’s necessary in other courses such as MCM 1200: Special Topics in Modern Culture and Media. MCM graduate students will most often have their first teaching experience in MCM 0150, whose subject matter makes it an excellent conceptual introduction to teaching in MCM fields. Being a teaching assistant generally entails conducting discussion sections and grading. You may also be asked to give a lecture, in order to broaden your own teaching experience. It is the general practice in MCM for faculty to conduct weekly conferences with their teaching assistants, covering pedagogical goals, objectives, and strategies, course materials, and grading.The Department also tries to provide all doctoral candidates with the opportunity to teach a course of their own, normally under the rubric of MCM 0900: Sophomore Seminars. This ideally occurs in the 4th year of study, but may be later. Since MCM 0900 is a seminar, its subject matter varies with the instructor. You will choose your course topic in conjunction with your advisor, though undergraduate curricular constraints may also have to be considered (for example, a similar or identical course might be planned by a faculty member.) Candidates are strongly encouraged to design a course related to their dissertation area, and to consult with their advisor and other appropriate faculty when designing the course. The course must be approved by the Department, and then the undergraduate College through the College Curriculum Committee (the CCC). Plan ahead. The CCC requires a formal application, which should be made the year before the course is to be taught so that it can be listed in the on-line Banner System. It is best to consult with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Department Administrator about these procedures early in your third year.(top)The Department and the Graduate School consider five years to be the optimum period for completion of all Ph.D. requirements. It is also recognized, however, that for some students an additional year might be necessary. As noted above, financial support in the form of fellowships, proctorships, and teaching assistantships is usually not guaranteed for a sixth year. When a sixth year is necessary to complete the dissertation, a candidate will have to apply for an extra year’s support. Assuming the candidate is making good progress towards completion, the Department will try to support such applications. Candidates should also look into any possibilities for external funding.(top)The following represents ideal progress towards the Ph.D. for those who do not enter the program with an M.A.Fall Semester:  2 coursesSpring Semester: 2 coursesSpring-Summer:Fall Semester: 1 or 2 coursesSpring Semester: Remaining 1 or 2 coursesFall Semester: Successful completion of MCM 0900 courseSpring Semester:Fall Semester: TA or dissertation fellowshipSpring Semester: TA or dissertation fellowshipThe timetable for students entering the program with an M.A. is slightly different. While the pace of coursework is the same as for those entering with a B.A., the candidate may have the third-year courses waived. Since the Preliminary Examination is taken upon completion of coursework, this means that it would be taken a year earlier (at the end of the second year). Everything else is accelerated by a year, including the teaching and funding timetables.In addition, the Qualifying Review will take place after the student has completed 6 courses instead of 8.(top)Graduate School Travel Funds for Presenting Papers at Conferences: The Graduate School makes $500 available to support travel to one conference per year at which the student presents a paper. Although the funding comes from the Graduate School, application for it must be made through MCM well in advance of the conference as it requires the signature of the Director of Graduate Studies. The student will have to submit a travel expense form and all original receipts to the Graduate School after travel is completed. For information and the application form, click here.(top)The Graduate School has negotiated the following exchange arrangements with some of Brown’s peer institutions. MCM students may participate if the exchange permits types of coursework unavailable at Brown, and if that coursework is especially useful for the student’s plan of study. A student should only engage in an exchange arrangement if it is approved by the Director of Graduate Studies.Exchange Scholar Program: After completion of one year at Brown, graduate students are eligible to enroll for one or two semesters in the Graduate Schools of the following universities: University of California at Berkeley, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, MIT, Princeton University, Stanford University, and Yale University. You will continue to pay tuition at Brown. Note that participation in this program may affect your financial support from Brown; for example, if your support is in the form of a teaching assistantship and you cannot fulfill your teaaching responsibilities while studying at the other institution, you will not receive your stipend. Click here for more information from the Graduate School.Cross-Registration at Harvard: There is a long-standing agreement between Harvard and Brown to allow cross-registration of graduate students without paying tuition to the host institution. To do this, you must get the proper forms from the Registrar’s office at each university, and signatures from the director of each Graduate Program and a dean from each Graduate School. If instead of one course you want to take an entire semester’s course work at Harvard, then you need to enroll in the Exchange Scholar Program.(top)The university defines a Traveling Scholar as a graduate student whose research (for example, on a dissertation) requires that he or she must be away from Brown in order to pursue studies full time. The advantages include a very modest registration fee and health insurance support. There is a time limit of one year, though it may be extended in exceptional cases. For more on traveling scholar status, click here.Traveling Scholar status should not be confused with a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence assumes that the candidate is suspending his or her studies. If a student believes he or she may have to suspend studies for any reason, that student should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies as soon as possible. A Leave of Absence should only be taken for the most serious of reasons, and in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. Regulations regarding such leaves, readmission, tuition consequences, and so forth are summarized here.(top)Faculty and Administrative Offices: Most MCM faculty and administrative offices are located at 155 George St. In 2004, MCM expanded into a second building at 135 Thayer St., just around the corner from the first building. The second building houses production facilities, screening rooms, and classrooms.Graduate Student Offices: TA offices are in the basement of 155 George St. Schedule conflicts should not arise due to the offices’ abundant space and sound-reducing cubicles. However, in the case that they do, priority must be given to those using the offices for their TA duties.Mail: Every graduate student is assigned a mailbox in the department office. Significant notices and information from the Department and other university offices such as the Graduate School are sent there, so you should regularly check your mailbox. Mailboxes are located on the first floor of 155 George St.Your Brown mailing address is:  Your NameDepartment of Modern Culture and MediaBrown UniversityBox 1957Providence, RI 02912Building Access: The exterior doors of MCM and the TA offices are on the Card Access system, which means your Brown ID Card is your key. After getting your ID card, you will need to speak to the Department Administrator to arrange card access to the building and offices. Entry to 135 Thayer is limited to those taking or teaching classes in that building. It works through the same Card Access system.Libraries: The main library is the Rockefeller Library (10 Prospect St.), whose holdings include Humanities and Social Sciences. The other large general use library is the Science Library (201 Thayer St.), which includes materials on psychoanalysis, and the history of science and technology among other things. If you wish, you may apply for a carrel assignment in the Rockefeller Library. Ask about this at the circulation desk of the library.Click here for an interactive map of Brown’s libraries.Brown students also have borrowing privileges at the RISD Library (2 College St.). Ask about this at the Rockefeller Library, as the RISD Library requires a letter of introduction from Brown.The Brown library participates in various Ivy League, area, and national library consortium arrangements. Furthermore, interlibrary loan has become quite fast and can sometimes deliver journal articles to you electronically. You should explore the library website and become familiar with these resources.Brown Media Archive: The Brown Media Archive, located at 155 George St., is a constantly expanding pedagogical and research collection of film and television/video materials covering both U.S. and international media. As of this writing, it includes more than 800 16mm film prints, 1400 videotapes, and hundreds of DVDs. It is a significant research resource whose holdings are not open to the general public. MCM’s Media Archivist is Richard Manning. His office is on the first floor of 155 George St. He can be reached at 863-3703.Video Checkout Room: Videos and DVDs from the Archive may be viewed in the Video Checkout Room in the basement of 155 George St. Its academic year hours are Monday-Friday, 9:30 am – 4:30 pm. It is closed during the summer. Smaller classes may be assigned to analyze materials there, so a viewing station may sometimes be unavailable; consult in advance about using it. MCM’s TA offices are also equipped with VCRs and DVD players.Computing: During orientation, Computer and Information Services (CIS) provides an orientation for graduate students, which may well be useful for you. You should be aware of the specific software CIS supports and consider changing to supported word processing, internet browsing and e-mail software if you do not already use it. Many of these programs are available on networked computers such as those in Department offices. Click here for support Information from CIS.Important: No matter what your software, you should establish a NetID and password through CIS as soon as you have your Brown ID card. Your NetID and password are required for using the computer clusters, gaining access to individual information such as grades, and using the Brown library system from off-campus. Activate your account hereThe Malcolm Forbes Center: The Malcolm S. Forbes Center for Media and Culture sponsors conferences and lectures organized by MCM faculty, and research projects associated with the Department. Topics of some conferences that have been sponsored by the Center include: Television and Nationality; Modernism and Modernity; The Archeology of Digital Multi-Media; Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project. The Center has also sponsored or supported several public events that exhibit media texts normally difficult to access in the U.S. Examples include: a festival of Portuguese and Lusophone cinema; a festival of Turkish diaspora cinema in Germany; and annual festivals of French/Francophone cinema, and contemporary African cinema. The Center also supports the Modernist Journals Project, which is constructing fully-searchable online editions of English-language journals and magazines that were important in shaping modes of art and literature that came to be called modernist.Multi-disciplinary resources: MCM has a long history of interdisciplinary collaboration across departmental lines. The Department maintains ties with many other university units, such as the Africana Studies Department, the American Civilization Department, the Comparative Literature Department, the English Department, the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, the Visual Art Department, and others. Depending on their interests and coursework and with the approval of their advisor, candidates may count work in other Brown departments towards their course requirements. Students may include one faculty member from another department on their examination and/or dissertation committees. In addition, other units offer speakers, symposia, exhibits and conferences that are often pertinent to the concerns of MCM graduate students, sometimes with support from MCM.(top)Prof. Lynne JoyrichDepartment ChairLynne_Joyrich@brown.edu(401)863-2382Prof. Ellen RooneyDirector of Graduate StudiesEllen_Rooney@brown.edu(401) 863-2152Susan McNeilDepartment ManagerSusan_McNeil@Brown.edu(401) 863-3535Liza HebertProgram CoordinatorLiza_Hebert@Brown.edu(401) 863-2853TBDFilm and Media Archivist(401) 863-3703(top)  Brown UniversityThe Graduate SchoolDepartment of Modern Culture and MediaRegistrar’s OfficeBrown Online Course Announcement (BOCA)(top)Brown E-mail AccessBrown Daily JoltComputing and Information Sciences (CIS)Brown University LibrariesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownAt two points in the program, the student meets with a committee that assesses his or her accomplishments and prospects. First, after completing 8 courses (or 6 courses for those who enter the program with an M.A.), the student undergoes a qualifying review and is certified to continue studies. Those who entered the program with a B.A. are now awarded an M.A. in Modern Culture and Media. Second, after completion of all coursework, the student takes the preliminary examination, which authorizes her or him to initiate the dissertation process.The qualifying review is a meeting with the department Graduate Committee. The committee reviews the student's progress to that point and then confers with the student for a 90-minute discussion. This gives the student the opportunity to communicate with the committee. The substance of the meeting is both retrospective and prospective. It includes discussion both of the student's work at Brown to that point and of conceptualizations and plans for future directions. The latter includes possible preliminary examination fields.The preliminary examination is an oral examination conducted by a faculty committee constituted by the student in conjunction with the department Director of Graduate Studies. The substance of the exam depends on the student's particular research and teaching interests, and the student has an important role in determining exam areas. In delineating those areas in collaboration with her or his committee, the student is in many ways defining her or his intellectual and professional arenas. This self-definition is carried out in two related stages of preparation for the examination.First, the candidate, in consultation with the exam committee, defines and prepares three exam fields. The three fields will be configured as follows:Working with his or her preliminary examination committee, the student constructs core bibliographies in each field, including media texts for Fields One and Three. Taken together, the fields should define the areas in which the student is planning to teach as well as the scholarly contexts for the student's projected research.Second, in consultation with the committee the student writes a fields essay. This fields essay explains the three fields and their interconnections, the kinds of issues and scholarship that constitutes them, and the kinds of research questions, scholarly issues, and debates in which the candidate plans to intervene. This essay will provide a starting point for the examination.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownModern Culture and Media (MCM) is an interdisciplinary concentration that explores the ties between media and broader cultural and social formations. We stress creative thinking and critical production: comparative analysis and theoretical reflection, as well as work that integrates practice and theory. We thus bring together aspects of modern culture that are normally separated by university departmental structures such as film and media studies, fine art, literature, literary arts and philosophy. This concentration offers the student a wide range of possible specializations.  A student might decide to focus on the critical study and production of a certain type or combination of media (print, photography, sound recording, cinema, video, television, and digital media); or they might focus on certain cultural, theoretical and/or social formations (for example, gender/sexuality in post-Cold war television, postcolonial theory and film, the changing form of the novel, theories of subjectivity and ideology, video games and theories of representation).  These paths are united by a committement to critical thinking/practice: rather than reproducing conventions, MCM concentrators learn how conventions emerge, what work they do, and explore ways to change them.MCM concentrators must complete the College Writing Requirement by taking two writing-intenstive or WRIT courses. For more information on this university requirement, please go to:  https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/curriculum/writing-requirementMCM supports two main undergraduate concentrations, Track I and Track II.Track I consists of 11 MCM courses. Courses from other departments may count toward the fulfillment of a focus area, and must be approved by an MCM concentration advisor as part of a coherent program of study.Track II concentration consists of 11 courses distributed as follows: two core courses, two additional courses below the 1000-level, three 1000-level courses, four production courses, and one senior seminar. Students are expected to meet regularly with their concentration advisors; they are required to meet at the beginning of their seventh semester to review their concentrations. Students who declare a double concentration may count up to two courses for concentration credit in MCM that are also counted towards concentration credit in another department or program.Anthony CokesAnthony_Cokes@brown.eduPlease Note: Students who have already declared a concentration using the paper form must revise that concentration and add additional concentrations by using the paper form. Paper Concentration forms If you have not already declared a concentration using this form, please use the online declaration form.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

Interested students are also encouraged to discuss their ideas with the MCM undergraduate honors director.Students who qualify for Honors are eligible to apply to do an Honors project or thesis. Students should submit a letter of intent in their 6th semester, and a formal proposal, by the first day of their 7th semester.  Applications will be screened by the MCM Honors Committee. (Application forms are available in the MCM office.) If approved, a student must then register for MCM1970, a one credit course which can count towards their Focus Area requirements, and MCM1990, a one-credit thesis course in which they complete the Honors project/thesis. Applications are due in MCM on the first day of class, of the Fall semester, of the senior year (for mid-year graduates, the due date is the last Friday in February of the 7th semester). Proposals will be reviewed by the MCM Honors Director and students will be notified within one month.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe 5th Year Master’s Degree in Modern Culture and Media allows an MCM concentrator to continue at Brown for a master’s degree after completing the bachelor’s degree. Two courses taken as an undergraduate will be counted toward the master’s degree, leaving six courses to be taken in the postgraduate year and only six tuition units to be paid for the usual eight course degree. Students cannot transfer a graduate course taken at another school. University regulations mandate that the student must take enough courses to earn each degree independently; that is, no courses may count towards both degrees. Because of this, the department requires that, by the end of the fourth year, the candidate must have taken two extra MCM courses over and above requirements for the MCM concentration. These extra courses must be appropriate for graduate credit (1000- or 2000-level MCM courses.)The reason is the following. Eight courses are required for the M.A. in Modern Culture and Media. First-year graduate students normally take six courses, and this is what 5th Year Master’s students will do during their fifth year. Therefore, to meet the eight-course requirement for the fifth year, the department requires two applicable courses before the fifth year. Note: While, the two extra courses applying to the M.A. may not count towards an undergraduate concentration in MCM, they may still count towards the 30-course graduation requirement for the bachelor’s degree.MCM concentrators considering applying to this program should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies as well as their undergraduate advisor about the two extra courses. In the fifth year, courses will be chosen in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies, who will be the student’s advisor. A student must apply for the program no later than the second week of the final semester of undergraduate study. Admission must be approved by the Department of Modern Culture and Media and by the Graduate School. While a student must be enrolled as an active undergraduate student at the time of application, admission to the graduate program can be deferred for up to two years with approval of the program. Requirements for Admission to the program: The applicant must be a concentrator in MCM with a 3.5 GPA in MCM courses. Application deadline:  A student must make application no later than the second week of his or her final semester of undergraduate study. Submissions to the department: The applicant must write a letter to the Director of Graduate Studies informing the department in writing that she or he is applying to the 5th Year Master’s program in MCM. This letter should indicate MCM faculty with whom the applicant has worked. The applicant must also provide a writing sample of work done for an MCM class. The writing sample should be included with the letter. Submissions to the Graduate School: In addition, the applicant must complete the online application and the 5th-Year Master’s Degree Application Supplement Form.  Both applications can be obtained from the Graduate School website.  Two letters of recommendation are required.Coursework: A total of 8 courses suitable for graduate credit (1000- or 2000- level, including production) and approved by the MCM Director of Graduate Studies. None of these may be courses that count towards the undergraduate degree. Among these eight courses, candidates are required to take at least one 2000-level MCM course in each of the following areas: 90-minute Qualifying Review:  Administered by the Graduate Committee upon completion of coursework. There is a description of the Qualifying Review for doctoral candidates in the department’s Graduate Student Handbook. The exam will be modified to make it suitable for a terminal M.A. candidate. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownTrack I concentrators may choose to study a particular historical moment, a medium, or a mode of textual production, in combination with theoretical studies that examine the categories of cultural analysis: for example, the distinction between high and low culture. Examples of areas of interest include but are not limited to film, gender/sexuality, digital media, television, post-coloniality, the novel, modern thought, the modern arts, sound, and theories of ideology and subjectivity. Productive work in some modern medium or textual mode is encouraged for all concentrators. MCM’s approach to production recognizes the inextricable link between theory and practice, and the possibility of a fruitful complicity between them. Production, in the sense defined here, is a theoretically informed sphere or practice, one within which acknowledged forms of cultural creation are tested and extended in close complementarity with the analyses conducted elsewhere in MCM.MCM concentrators must complete the College Writing Requirement by taking two writing-intenstive or WRIT courses.a. MCM0150 (MCM0150 replaced MCM0110.)Concentrators can substitute MCM0110 to fulfill the MCM0150 requirement. b. two of the following core courses: MCM0220, MCM0230, MCM0240, MCM0250, MCM0260, MCM1110.No more than three courses from this list may count for concentration requirements. Students who declare a double concentration may count up to two courses for concentration credit in MCM that are also counted towards concentration credit in another department or program.Students who qualify for Honors in Track I are eligible to apply to do an Honors project or thesis. Students should submit a letter of intent in their 6th semester, and a formal proposal, by the first day of their 7th semester.  Applications will be screened by the MCM Honors Committee. (Application forms are available in the MCM office.) If approved, a student must then register for MCM1970, a one credit course which can count towards their Focus Area requirements, and MCM1990, a one-credit thesis course in which they complete the Honors thesis.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
