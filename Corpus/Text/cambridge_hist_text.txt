We hope that this handbook will help guide you through the course and give you an idea of what is expected. If you cannot find the answer you are looking for or you have any questions, the Graduate Office will be happy to help.Cambridge is one of the top-ranked universities in the world. Study is intense and intellectually demanding and we place great emphasis on independent and self-directed learning. The University has its own academic conventions and expects you to take responsibility for your own learning.  Academic support is provided by your College and by the Faculty of History.The way we teach, the assessment methods used, and the emphasis on independent and self- directed learning may be very different to what you are used to. We hope that this handbook will help you understand what the course involves (e.g., course structure, progress through the first probationary year of the PhD, teaching approach, academic conventions, your first year assessment) and what is expected from you.As a student, you benefit from enviable access to some of the best library and museum collections in the world, as well as other specialist resources such as the language centre and IT facilities.The University provides strong support for your personal, professional, and career development and consequently provides information and opportunities to enhance and develop your skills to help you achieve your full potential.The University provides a great deal of information for students on living and studying in Cambridge and the pages for Cambridge students offer some tips that will hopefully make your time at Cambridge as stress-free as possible. These pages offer information about life in Cambridge, including the roles of your College, the Faculty and the University. Also, while it is hoped that your time at Cambridge will be an untroubled one, there may be occasions when you need additional  help and support, and so welfare and wellbeing support can also be found on these pages. The pages for International Students give details on life and study in Cambridge and may be of interest to all incoming students who are unfamiliar with Cambridge.http://www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/ http://www.internationalstudents.cam.ac.uk/studying Please find information from the Central University on Welfare and Wellbeing here.

If you feel at any point you would like to pass on some feedback, please feel free to visit or contact the Graduate Office.The Faculty hope that most problems can be resolved quickly and efficiently by simple consultation or discussion with the right person – normally your Supervisor, College Tutor or the Directors of Graduate Studies and Graduate Training. They might be able to solve the problem directly, either by intervening or offering suitable advice about how to proceed or where to go for further assistance and advice.However, where this has failed to resolve the problem, students may seek advice from or submit an appeal or complaint to the Faculty’s Ombudsperson or to the central Student Complaints and Appeals Section.We hope that most problems can be resolved with your Supervisor, your College Tutors or the Faculty Directors, but where a problem cannot be resolved through these channels, the Faculty has appointed Ombudspersons to whom you can go to for advice.Ombudspersons are senior members of the Faculty whose task is to address any serious complaints about the academic quality or pedagogic efficiency of supervision made by research students. The role of the Ombudspersons is pastoral support and their actions are strictly confidential. Records of contacts between students and Ombudspersons will not appear in the student’s file. To note: Ombudspersons also take the role Faculty Harassment Advisers and will process complaints of this nature under rules issued by the central University: www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/policy/dignity/For the academic year 2017-2018, the Ombudspersons are:Dr Gabriela RamosDr Arthur AsserafDr Julia GuarnieriStudents should visit the following website for details on how to complain to the Student Complaints and Appeals Section.www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/academic/comp_app/index.htmlThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The dates for the current year are below:In order to qualify for a Cambridge Degree, students are required to meet the below terms of residence:• Full-time students must ‘keep’ three terms in Cambridge; for a term to be 'kept,' a student has to reside in Cambridge for a minimum number of nights (60 for the Michaelmas and Lent Terms and 53 for the Easter Term). • All full-time graduate students are expected to live within the University’s precincts; that is, within the 10 mile radius of Great St Mary's church while carrying out research in the University. Students who have good reason to live further away must have the agreement of their supervisor that this will not impair their ability to study and to attend the University as required, and the consent of their College and the Faculty’s Degree Committee The exception to the above rules is that PhD students may apply for ‘Working Away from Cambridge' to undertake research relevant to their project. Please see here.Research students are expected to be in attendance and actively working on their research between terms, except during periods of holiday agreed with their supervisor, not normally exceeding 8 weeks in a 12-month period.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Though the central objective of the Faculty of History’s graduate courses is to provide students with the opportunity to engage in a serious piece of research and writing, the courses also offer training in a wide range of skills. Some of these skills are highly specialized and relate to specific kinds of academic research, but many are part of the wider training required to perform well in academic and research posts, and many are transferable skills of use in many kinds of non-academic employment.These pages give the details of the Faculty’s graduate training programme. Current students can access the Graduate Training Booklet on their relevant Moodle pages (which gives specific details of sessions) and please also consult the Graduate Training calendar. We have also suggested other areas within the University to explore as there is a lot of training on offer and not just with the Faculty!If you have a query about the training offered by the Faculty, please contact Dave McLaughlin on gradtraining@hist.cam.ac.uk; if your query is for other training, please contact the relevant organisation.We are happy to receive suggestions and constructive criticisms either directly to the Directors of Graduate Training and Graduate Studies or through the Graduate Representative. We run an annual Graduate Training Survey and really welcome your responses!Some sessions require students to sign-up for them (because places are limited). Students are urged to sign-up for sessions early as these sessions operate on a first come, first served basis. How do I know which sessions I can/should attend?We have included a suggestion of 'who can attend' for each event within the Faculty-provided training within these pages. If you are not listed in the eligibility section then you can always ask whoever is running the session to see if they are happy for you to attend. For training with other providers, please check with the relevant organisation to see if you are eligible. Doctoral students, in consultation with their supervisors, should review their training needs at the start of each academic year. They should use the Training Log to record their training development.Post-doctoral researchers are entitled to participate in the training options and should sign up as instructed in each option.You should look out for additional opportunities which may arise during the year and will be announced here.

It is interested in, of course, exploring large-scale changes provoked by technological advancement: how new methods of archiving, data manipulation, social media, crowdsourcing, mapping and so forth are producing new ways of making history, new ways of communicating research to scholarly and public audiences, and new methodological problems for the historical profession. But we also construe "technology" in the broadest sense: from virtual databases to physical index cards; from Kindles to books; from python to provenience, from Mellel to Moleskines; from cameras to pencils; from digital archives to the manuscript that crumbles in our hands. Thus this seminar is also a space for encouraging graduate students to rethink what historians do and how we do it. Digital technologies do not only open new archives, perspectives and methodological pathways, but also invite us to revisit the lasting significance of traditional methods and practices in historical scholarship. How do you organise your research notes? How best to keep track of voluminous reading lists and new scholarship? How do we manage book collections in this hybrid age of ink and E-ink? How and where do you write? With what tools do you approach the archive? How should we think about archival serendipity in the age of Search? The Digital History Seminar is a unique conversational space for graduates to come together to explore these developments, which are slowly but surely reshaping the discipline. For questions, suggestions and anything else, please contact the convener, Dr Leigh Denault (ltd22@cam.ac.uk)Michaelmas term seminar details can be found here  Course leader: Max Satchell, CAMPOP, Department of Geography & Faculty of HistoryDemonstrator: Ellen Potter, CAMPOP, Department of GeographyWant to make great looking maps but don’t know where to start? GIS (Geographical Information Systems) is the answer. Formerly the preserve of the IT specialist, in the last 15 years GIS software has become easy to use. GIS is now something anyone with basic computing skills can do.As members of the University you have free access to state of the art GIS software the annual license fee of which is £50 K for individuals in the private sector. Take advantage of it! The GIS for Historians course is a practical introduction to working with GIS software. The emphasis is very much on learning by doing in a supported environment with plenty of help on hand . Students are also encouraged to ask questions about GIS as it pertains to their own research. Topics covered include basic GIS and mapping, sourcing digital historical GIS data, creating GIS datasets from written sources, digitizing from historical maps, simple and more complex GIS analyses, 3d GIS and cartograms.The course is available to Masters and PhD students of the Faculty of History.For information of when sessions are held, please check the Graduate Training calendar for sessions under 'GIS for Historians'. These two seminars aim to introduce graduate historians to the practices of planning, constructing and analysing oral histories. Each seminar will examine several of the methodological or theoretical debates within this field, and will be supplemented by discussion of a specific case study.

You can also use the Graduate Training calendar to see when sessions are scheduled. Aimed at new PhD students, known as NOTAFs (Not at First Registered). There will be an after-party following this event where you can meet the Graduate Office staff as well as your fellow PhD candidates. This is aimed at new graduate members of the Faculty (NOTAF and MPhil) to help understand some of the services on offer within the University. These include, but are not limited to, the Faculty Computer Office, the Seeley Library, the Careers Service, the Language Centre, University-wide Training, and your Graduate Representative. Meet your Graduate Representative and find out about the student-initiated workshops available within the Faculty. Workshops are an excellent way to test out ideas among peers in a research-friendly environment. We will be staggering this event for MPhils in one slot followed by NOTAFs in a later slot. An informal question-and-answer session for graduate students who are new to Cambridge. Come to hear the Head of Humanities and Social Sciences Libraries and Seeley Librarian talk about the Seeley Library as well as what is offered with the University Library. The Seeley is part of the UL and so this is an introduction to finding secondary, and some primary, historical sources, as well as historical sources online. As well as what is offered through the University Library, there are some specific collections available within Cambridge with the colleges. Come to hear representatives give a brief introduction to what their respective collections contain and get contact details for if these may be useful in your research area. As well as the central AHRC induction event, AHRC awardholders should attend in order to find out about communications newsletters, JeS accounts, additional awards, training and transferable skills requirements, the international placement scheme, submission rates, and much more. A welcome session for the all the NOTAFs who joined in Lent or Easter and consequently missed the earlier Welcome sessions. All doctoral students should download a Personal Training Plan and Training Log. You can find these documents on your relevant Moodle pages. Following the initial meeting with your supervisor when you discuss appropriate training and skills, you can then retain and complete your log and plan. For probationary PhD students, your supervisor will upload your log and attendance along with their supervision report on your registration meeting. Other PhDs may wish to ask their supervisors to include their log within their termly supervision reports. This allows you to track your training progress and discuss with your supervisor what else you need to continue improving. You can include courses, lectures, seminars, workshops, and any other training you have received as you progress through your course.

Some are thematic, some are period-based; all bring together MPhil and graduate students to discuss and present their work in a supportive peer environment. Many workshops also pursue projects such as conference panels and colloquia, and most become friend groups. Some offer sandwiches, some insist on wine. All provide a lively environment to meet other historians working on topics which are at least marginally related.We have three thematic workshops which run on a yearly basis. Each year, there are three places for thematic workshops for which graduate students can apply (including the current thematic workshops, which only run for a year at a time). The call for workshop Proposals usually opens in early Lent - more details will be provided soon. Please contact the Grad Rep for any more information, and we look forward to reading your workshop proposals.Grad Rep: gradrep@hist.cam.ac.uk Meet the WorkshopsSession Leader: all the convenors of the Graduate Workshops, Grad Rep Meet the Grad Rep and find out about the workshops available within the Faculty. Workshops are an excellent way to test out ideas among peers in a research-friendly environment.  The workshops are a great place to fine-tune a paper for a conference presentation, and to test ideas. Neither presentation nor even participation are mandatory, but any PhD student who fails to get involved in at least one workshop is really missing out on a useful, exciting, and fun part of the faculty's grad programme.All workshop programmes are available on the Graduate Training Google calendar. Workshop organisation is another great experience - and good for the CV. Sign up for the mailing lists that each workshop runs by emailing the workshop convenor or visiting the 'Meet the Workshops' session at the beginning of the year. If you have a personal Google account you can also tell the calendar to text or email you when workshop events are about to happen.

We encourage submissions from Masters and PhD students, as well as early career researchers, working on gender and sexuality (broadly defined) from any time period.Although gender and sexuality are the overriding themes of the workshop, we welcome submissions that consider how these themes can be applied to a broader range of historical events, periods, mentalités, people or processes. Most of those who attend the workshop regularly do not necessarily consider themselves gender scholars, but have nevertheless welcomed the opportunity that the workshop provides to consider the historical role that gender can play in even the seemingly unlikeliest of situations. The workshop provides an opportunity to present finished or work-in-progress research to a friendly and supportive audience of your peers. Papers are likely to be 20-30 minutes in length, but we welcome submissions for longer formats or shorter paired papers for panel discussion. The format and length are flexible and the paper can be given in the manner that best suits the presenter’s material with discussion to follow.We meet fortnightly in term at Clare College, on Wednesdays, for an hour from 13:00. A light lunch will be provided.Fred E. Smith (fes40)Owen Brittan (ob293)Katarzyna Brzezinska (kwb21@cam.ac.uk)George J. Severs (gjs53@cam.ac.uk)11th October - Asiya Islam and Owen BrittanThe New Woman: 150 Years of British and Indian Women's MagazinesUntil very recently you could easily make the case that magazines and newspapers were the most popular form of media dating back to the seventeenth century. While women’s magazines have commonly been dismissed as trivial on the basis that they are all about fashion, relationships, and domesticity, they offer a rich area for inquiry. The editors and owners of these publications wielded enormous normative power to both reflect upon and shape culture. Women’s magazines not only provided a forum for women to develop a sense of shared experiences but have also been at times instrumental in feminist movements.  In both India and the UK, women’s magazines have long and complex histories that reflect the changing attitudes of the day. This talk will trace the changing portrayal of women in print throughout the last 150 years and examine how historical events in both countries influenced these portrayals, where they diverged, and where they converged within an increasingly globalised society. 18th October - Dr Naomi PullinFaithless Friends: Women's Sociability and Conflict in the Long-Seventeenth CenturyIn his popular treatise De amicitia, Cicero noted that ‘Some men are better served by their bitter-tongued enemies than by their sweet-smiling friends’. But even today the question of who constitutes an enemy or a friend remains unresolved.  Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Britain has been characterised an age of 'sociability' and 'politeness', with the growth of spaces for sociable interaction such as the tea table, coffee house, salon, and new reading and writing practices. Much scholarly attention has recently been devoted to the friendly exchanges that took place between women during this moment of social and cultural transformation. However, few have acknowledged the tensions inherit in these relationships, or the ways in which an emerging culture of civility and politeness enhanced discussions about enmity and hostility. This paper seeks to question whether there was a specifically gendered dimension to female antagonism at this time by probing both the theory and practice of friendship in Britain in the long-seventeenth century. Using evidence drawn from published treatises, as well as the diaries and letters penned by women, it aims to present some preliminary ideas about the activities, conditions and behaviours that could at once 'make' and 'break' female intimacies. 25th October - Susanne SchmidtRethinking the double standard: Feminist constructions of aging in twentieth-century AmericaMiddle age is often associated with a “double standard” (Susan Sontag) according to which maturity is good for men, who reach their “prime of life,” but bad for women, whose aging is pathologized. But consider the understanding of midlife as the moment of a woman’s reinvention. The case of the “midlife crisis” offers a good example of this idea: it became popular with the American journalist Gail Sheehy’s best-selling Passages (1976) as a concept which described the onset of middle age as the moment when a woman would re-enter the world of work (while men often dropped out). In this talk, I study positive and critical concepts of midlife change, put forward in political treatises, social scientific and medical studies, best-selling books and self-help literature, and ask in what ways did women (and some men) use middle age for feminist purposes? Paying attention to “feminist voices” (Alexandra Rutherford) changes our understanding of the double standard about middle age. I show that feminist critique and empowering concepts of aging were integral to public debates about gender and the life course. Women drew on “prime of life” imagery, just like men, to describe middle life as the end of problems of motherhood and the beginning of liberation into public and professional lives and careers. Celebrations of aging sometimes explicitly opposed the double standard, yet they were more than defensive critiques: constructions of midlife liberation formed a stable system of thought in its own right, throughout the twentieth century, eliciting response and backlash, which attested to their currency and influence. 22nd November - Georgia OmanWomen’s higher education and the gendering of physical space in nineteenth-century CambridgeIn this paper, I will explore how gender was encoded in the physical space of the University of Cambridge in the late-nineteenth century, shaping how male and female students interacted with both the built environment and each other. As much as universities were sites of knowledge production and transmission, they were also geographical locations that both male and female students had to traverse and negotiate on a day-to-day basis. I will argue that coeducation in practice consisted of both segregation and integration defined by relation to physical space, while the gender divide it brought about was manifested architecturally, through the design and modification of shared and separate spaces.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Our definition of ‘Modern European’ is a broad one. We host papers on themes including, but not limited to, the political, cultural, economic, intellectual, social and military history of Europe from the 1700s to the present. Presentations on methodological issues and on comparative or transnational histories are also encouraged.We welcome presentations on work in progress and on completed projects as well as papers from MPhils and PhDs at an early stage of their research. Throughout the year, the workshop also holds special events that are aimed at offering advice for early career development. Past events have included Q&As on academic publishing and ‘state of the discipline’ talks by leading historians from Cambridge and beyond. The workshop meets on Tuesdays between 4:45pm and 5:45pm in the Old Library at Sidney Sussex College. Sessions take the format of a 20-30 minute presentation, followed by questions and discussion. Every term the workshop meets for an End-of-Term Dinner at a nearby restaurant or College, and at the start of Michaelmas we host a Welcome Dinner for all new and continuing graduate students.The workshop calendar, which lists upcoming and past events, is available at http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/52316.Please access information on our previous workshops here.For any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the convenors.   Timothy J.

As well as having a long-established expertise in British and European history, Cambridge has particular strengths in Extra-European History. While some of the most famous Cambridge historians have focused on political and constitutional history, the Faculty has also played a central role in the development of the history of political thought and in the flourishing fields of economic, social and cultural history. Its members include specialists in business and religious history and in the history of population, the family and gender.Much of the work in these fields is done in collaboration with other Faculties from across the University including African Studies, Divinity and Politics and International Studies. The Faculty recruits outstanding graduate students from all backgrounds across the entire range of the discipline of History. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Students must accept responsibility for their own research activity and candidacy for a degree. Postgraduate work demands a high degree of self-discipline and organisation. Students are expected to take full responsibility for producing the required course work and thesis to the deadlines specified under the timetable for submission.  Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This stimulating course is designed for those who have completed degrees in which History is the main or at least a substantial component and who want to consolidate their knowledge of the period between 1500 and 1800. It aims to deepen students’ understanding of how early modern history has been studied and to explore how traditional and innovative methods can be used to interpret it.The MPhil in Early Modern History combines taught and research elements over a 9-month full-time programme. The taught elements include three modules, as well as training workshops and seminars, and all students will also complete a long piece of independent research (15,000 – 20,000 words).Throughout the course students will be supervised by a dedicated member of staff, who will guide their research towards the completion of an original historical subject chosen and developed by them. In addition, students will benefit from Cambridge’s vibrant research environment, attending and participating in guest talks, workshops and other events throughout the year.The course is designed for those who have completed degrees in which History is the main or at least a substantial component and who want to consolidate their knowledge of early modern history. It is particularly appropriate for those who may wish to continue on to a PhD, at Cambridge or elsewhere.  It is also well-suited for those who seek simply to explore early modern history at a deeper level. It is expected that this will be the normal means by which those without an appropriate Master’s degree from elsewhere will prepare for the PhD degree in Early Modern History at Cambridge.Cambridge graduates in Early Modern History have taken up positions in UK and international universities or followed careers in business, the media, law and politics. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This course aims to explore a variety of movements and ideologies that emerged in the early twentieth-century Europe, and which might be labelled as fascist. Examining the similarities and differences between those movements, the course seeks to uncover the complex nexus of ideas that underpinned this contested concept. What are the defining characteristics of fascism? Can we talk about fascism in the singular? If so, what are the common denominators uniting the various fascist movements? The classes will cover not only Italy and Germany, but also Austria, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. Finally, the course will consider the continuing legacy of fascism into the present. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It draws upon the expertise of faculty members in each of these areas, as well as in Middle Eastern, Oceanic and American history. The MPhil in World History enables students to develop strong expertise in this rich and expanding field of historical scholarship.The MPhil in World History combines courses and a dissertation over a 9-month program. The core course focuses on historiographical debates in world history, leading to two options, usually in the history of a world region. From the first term, students also begin directed research for a 15,000 word dissertation, working closely with their supervisor from the Faculty’s World History Subject Group. Students will also take language classes, a component that is required but not examined. This may be in any language offered by the Cambridge University Language Centre, and may be elementary, continuing or advanced. In this way, the MPhil in World History offers students thorough preparation for an advanced research degree that will be highly valued in institutions across the world.Tweets by @CamWorldHistoryTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

You need to complete this in order to complete the PhD. The maximum of the part-time programme is 21 terms (i.e. seven years). Myth buster: does a part-time PhD mean I don’t get the ‘Cambridge experience’?Not at all! You will still be a member of a college and therefore be able to experience the collegiate system.Your supervisor is appointed in exactly the same way and serves exactly the same purpose.You will still have an interview in the admissions process.You still have an RAE (Registration Assessment Exercise) but this is usually held during your fifth or sixth term (different timing to the full-time PhD).You still have access to the training and teaching within the Faculty. In order for you to gain the most benefit, we ask that you live within a reasonable distance so as to be able to attend Cambridge regularly. The part-time PhD is a not a distance-learning degree.The total University Composition Fee for the degree is the same, whether full-time or part-time. In practice, this means that 60% of the full-time fee is charged for each term of registration as a part-time student. College fees are charged on the same basis.  What is different for a part-time PhD?On the application form, there is a box which needs to be ticked by applicants wishing to pursue a part-time degree. You will then need to provide a statement saying why you need to study part-time instead of full-time.You can continue to be in employment with the part-time PhD, although full-time employment is not considered compatible with the degree. You provide a letter from your employer stating that you will be allowed the time off work to attend the University as required for the duration of your course.AHRC and ESRC fund part-time students, but part-time awards provide only 50% of the full-time rate of tuition fees. Be aware of this as the University charges part-time students 60% of the full-time rate, therefore the difference will need to be made up.You have an annual progress paper where, at the end of each calendar year, you meet with your supervisor to consider a brief but formal progress paper prepared by the student.  How is the part-time PhD examined?It is examined in exactly the same way as the full-time PhD is examined. Here is a table of the different termly requirements: QUALIFICATIONTERM (1 being your first term)Minimum number of terms of research needed before submittingPart-time PhD15Minimum number of terms of research which need to be in Cambridge (in order to qualify for the PhD)Part-time PhD5End of term by which your draft dissertation must be submitted to your supervisorPart-time PhD16Absolute final submission deadlinePart-time PhD21Maximum number of terms for which an exemption or allowance will be made following a one-year coursePart-time PhD5  Can I request early submission?Where exemption is sought for a previous qualification, the maximum number of terms for which exemption can be allowed is five terms, part-time.You apply for an exemption when you are near completion and know how many terms of research are required to complete the work. Early submission from part-time students who have no grounds for an exemption (e.g. previous qualification), but have been able to devote more time than expected is usually not permitted unless the full fee for a five-year minimum research period has been paid. What about transferring to full-time status?This is certainly possible, but don’t enter into it lightly – you can only do this once only in either direction e.g. move once from full-time to part-time, or move once from part-time to full-time.This application is submitted to the Degree Committee and is considered on a case-by-case basis – if your circumstances change then this is an option. Intellectual Property RightsIf you are employed then arrangements for intellectual property rights must be agreed in advance. Please make sure your employer reads this section.If the employer is not asserting any rights in the intellectual property created in the course of the research, a statement to this effect must be provided in writing within the application. Generally, this is expected to be the case where the employer is neither paying for the time of study nor contributing to fees. In the absence of any claim on the intellectual property by the employer, the position on intellectual property is identical to that of a full-time PhD student. More information on this is available on the Student Registry website.If the employer is claiming rights in the intellectual property, the applicant and the employer must sign a short agreement which, among other things, confirms the level of any sponsorship by the employer and also sets out the position on intellectual property. This is administered through the University’s Research Services Division (16 Mill Lane, Cambridge. CB2 1SB).While the employer may wish to retain ownership in any intellectual property created by the student, the University will also want to ensure that regard is given to the intellectual property rights in any contributions from the Supervisor or other members of the University, as well as its obligations to external sponsors.The University will also wish to make sure that the employer cannot restrict the use or exploitation of the student’s share in any collaborative project in which the student takes part. Part-time Co-ordinatorDr Paul Warde is currently the Faculty’s Co-ordinator of the part-time PhD. He is available to offer administrative advice to applicants – find him in the Academic Staff Directory here: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-paul-warde  Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

I have seen him approx every 3 – 4 weeks and he has been very conscientious: always reading my work and responding to my queries /problems very quickly. He has been an enormous source of guidance, encouragement and support. We have worked well together, setting deadlines that I have always reached and helping to advise on planning work."Every graduate student undertaking a PhD in History at Cambridge is assigned a supervisor. They are someone who has an interest in the same area of research as you, and their role is to guide your programme of study and research while helping you to identify your own specialist and generic training needs.Supervisors are there to help and are often extremely approachable. Be confident in saying that you would like to discuss a particular topic, or ask them questions about where you need to go next or what training would most benefit you. However, PhD students in History are expected to work largely on their own initiative – supervisors won’t do it all for you! As long as you are prepared to listen to your supervisor’s advice and be proactive in discussion with them, we hope that you will realise a fruitful working relationship with someone of similar interests.  How do you allocate a supervisor?All PhD students must have a supervisor and it is our responsibility to find one which we think suits you best. We have a wide range of academic staff here and you are welcome to browse our Academic Staff Directory: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/academic-staff. If you so wish, you can contact particular academics to discuss your application. Obviously, they cannot guarantee you a place, but most of them will be willing to talk about a possible research proposal and whether you are suited to study at Cambridge.When you apply, you can suggest a possible supervisor on the application form. This is helpful if you’ve already been in touch with someone, as above, and would like to work with them. It doesn’t mean that you will definitely get that particular supervisor, but it helps us know who you would like to work with.Don’t worry though if you can’t find anyone! If you don’t fill in the optional ‘prospective supervisor’ box, then we do the work for you. We know our department well, so we will send on your application for consideration to whoever we think is best.Sometimes, applications go through multiple supervisors before someone is found. This can be because academics are already full with PhD students, will be on leave or retiring soon, or think someone else suits your proposed subject better. If no one can be found then, unfortunately, we cannot accept your application. However, rest assured that we do all we can to get you supervisory cover!   Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It aims to bring academics, researchers and students from a wide variety of fields, academic backgrounds, and geographical locations into ever-closer dialogue with one another, and to explore the many ways in which cross-disciplinary themes, ideas, arguments and evidence can illuminate the early modern period.The seminar also seeks to challenge conventional boundaries of periodization and space, inviting scholars of ancient, medieval and modern worlds to explore the relationships between their work and the early modern period.The meeting is divided into two sections. The first section invites a guest speaker to deliver a paper on their research for one hour. The second section provides 15-30 minutes for the speaker to answer questions on the topic and engage in a discussion on the cross-disciplinary implications of their work. Attendees are invited to bring a packed lunch to the seminar. Tea and coffee is also provided.The seminars are held in Room sr14 in the Faculty of English from 12.00 to 13:15pm unless otherwise indicated For further information and conversation there is a seminar blog11th Oct Sara Norja, Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of English, University of Turku.

There are two main points of focus: Classical Greece of the fifth and fourth centuries BC, and Republican and early Imperial Rome from the turn of the third century BC to the mid-first century AD. Topics that are specifically Greek include Athenian democracy and culture, Spartan politics, society and foreign policy, Alexander the Great and Thucydides. Topics that are specifically Roman include Roman imperialism, the politics and constitution of the Republic, Roman religion, the establishment of the Principate by Augustus, the character and presentation of imperial power in the early Empire, and Tacitus. Topics that span both Greek and Roman history include gender and sexuality, and slavery.As with other Part I papers, core lectures in the Michaelmas Term will provide an outline of Greek or Roman history, and introduce you to key themes and interpretations in the paper; these are supported by eight lectures on ancient historical texts. Otherwise you will be expected to attend a sensible selection of the more thematic and historiographical/methodological lecture series listed below depending on whether you are focusing on Greek or Roman history and your particular interests.Lectures will be delivered in the Classics Faculty Building (on the Sidgwick site).The attached bibliographies concentrate on key items aimed at providing suggestive and interesting introductions to the various topics and the issues and controversies they involved.  They cut across rather than duplicate the division of material that is reflected in the organisation of the lectures. They are unashamedly selective; deliberately not exhaustive.  Taken together, they should give some idea of what this paper has to offer, and of the sheer fascinating variety of issues which confront any historian of the ancient world.Paper 12 reading listPaper 12 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The nature of that rule - provincial government, the imperial cult, the presentation of imperial power - is central to any understanding of the first two centuries AD. Why were some emperors (Caligula, Nero, Commodus) viewed as "bad", while others (Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius) were praised for their virtues?The course also examines the economic and social history of the Empire, looking in particular at the absorption of Greek culture by the Roman elite, at slavery, and at early Christianity. It then moves on to consider the extent to which this 'old world' of the early Empire survived the upheavals of the so-called Third Century Crisis and the impact of the reforms of both Diocletian and the Christian emperor Constantine. The theme of change is central for a consideration of the rise of Christianity in the fourth and fifth centuries and for understanding the shift in government to a more highly centralised and ceremonial monarchy.This is an often unsettling journey through a late-Antique world of distant god-like emperors, wild ascetic holy men, great saints, excitable virgins, charismatic heretics, oppressive bureaucrats and violent barbarians. The last named are significant. In looking at the so-called "decline and fall" of the Roman Empire, it is important to ask why the empire "fell" in the West but survived largely intact in the East.The middle part of the course concentrates on the period from the fifth to the eighth centuries. The fading away of the structures of the Roman state in the West in the fifth century led to the emergence of various 'barbarian' successor kingdoms, each influenced to a greater or lesser extent by Roman institutions, but also by the social traditions and martial culture of the 'barbarian' newcomers. The different kingdoms are examined, as too is the position of the popes in Rome.At the same time, consideration is given to the history of the surviving eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Justinian's attempts to restore the fortunes of the empire through internal reform and wars of reconquest are studied, as too is the social and economic history of the Mediterranean world at this time, which witnessed the first great outbreak of bubonic plague. The difficulties faced by the emperors of Constantinople in the late sixth century, the impact of warfare first with Persia, and then with an expansionist Islamic foe, and the response of the eastern, or 'Byzantine', empire to this phenomenon in the form of 'iconoclasm' are addressed. Consideration is given to the emergence of a vibrant and distinctive Islamic culture in the lands conquered by the Arabs.The latter part of the paper covers part of the period of Frankish and Carolingian dominance in western Europe in the eighth and ninth centuries, a time of remarkable political and cultural coherence, combined with crucial, very diverse and formative developments in every sphere of life. A principal focus is the expansion of Frankish rule eastwards and southwards into Germany, Italy and Spain, and the rise of the Carolingians under Pippin III, Charlemagne, Louis the Pious and Charles the Bald, an unbroken line of succession in the male line. Their interaction within the realms with the aristocracy, the church and the female members of their elite groups, as well as with external rivals and enemies such as the Vikings, the Slavs and Byzantium, is examined.Social adjustments, economic change and the establishment of a distinctive intellectual and cultural tradition in western Europe that drew strongly on the Roman past throughout the period from the fourth century onwards, are explored in relation to the wealth and variety of primary sources surviving from this period. Among the written sources - narrative, legislative, legal, epistolary and poetic - there is much now available in English translation. There are also many other categories of historical evidence exploited, such as archaeology, artefacts, architecture, art and coinage.SURVEY LECTURESThe lectures are designed as an essential survey of the entire period covered by the course. Even if you choose to concentrate on a particular part of the course in supervisions, you must attend ALL the lectures so as to be able to place your supervision essays in their wider context.Paper 13 reading listPaper 13 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The historical processes that took place during these centuries have been described as 'the making of Europe' and 'the first European revolution'. Many aspects of our society that we take for granted today have their origin in this period. To name but a few: lawyers, the political units that gave rise to the modern states, banking, and marriage by mutual consent.At the same time, the central Middle Ages were in many respects very different from our own epoch. Christianity was a defining characteristic of life; personal bonds rather than faceless bureaucracies dominated, and no sharp separation existed between public and private. The period is characterized both by the great territorial expansion of Christendom and the rise of new political, religious and economic systems. New regions joined Christendom: Scandinavia and Central Europe converted to Catholic Christianity, the Balkans and Rus' to Greek Orthodoxy. European expansion also proceeded through warfare, notably in Iberia and the Baltic, and crusaders even began the conquest of areas outside Europe.Within Europe, new governmental systems developed with the rise of new monarchies, and the papacy emerged as the effective head of the Catholic Church. Europe's economy started to change through the emergence of a money economy and international trade. The 'twelfth-century Renaissance' led to a renewal of the intellectual life. A search for greater involvement in religious life led to the rise of lay religious movements, some accepted, others branded as heretical by ecclesiastics. Such dramatic social, political and economic changes also led to confrontation and persecution. An increasing hostility to non-Catholic Christians, including heretics; warfare against Muslims conceived as 'holy war'; and the persecution of Jews (including pogroms and the invention of accusations such as the ritual murder of Christian children by Jews) also emerged during this period.The paper offers both a wide geographical scope encompassing not just western Europe but all of Europe; and a range of themes including (but not limited to) individual kingdoms, the church and religious institutions, the economy, marriage and the family, and the history of minorities. The lecture course is integrated with the supervision topics. Students should attend all lectures to get a good overview of the whole period, but they can select topics according to their own interests for supervision.Paper 14 reading listPaper 14 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Christian relations with another religion, Judaism, were marked by increasing persecution.It was a period of great cultural ferment, not merely in Italy, which became the home of a remarkable revival of classical art and letters, but also at princely courts in northern Europe, where magnificent display and the cult of chivalry reached new levels of extravagance. Yet this was also a period of dramatic social and economic change, in which the Black Death wiped out a third or more of the population of western Europe, turning topsy turvy the social structure of town and country as land values fell, labour became expensive, and rebellions broke out in Italian, Flemish, and French towns.The paper is intended to cover all facets of European history in the period, including social, cultural, intellectual and institutional, as well as economic, political and ecclesiastical history. The emphasis will be on Western and Southern Europe, although Eastern Europe will not be neglected. Some attention will be paid to European relations with other parts of the world.The book list is designed to suggest suitable topics for supervision but it by no means excludes other possibilities. The paper is treated in a sufficiently comprehensive way to allow individual undergraduates to concentrate on specific themes within the period and there are no compulsory questions, although undergraduates are encouraged to tackle a broad range of topics and should read more widely then required for supervisions, to place specific knowledge in a wider context. Because there are papers in the Tripos on British history and Political Thought, no questions will be set on these subjects but lecturers may allude to them in passing and undergraduates should also feel free to do so.Paper 15 reading listPaper 15 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Europe witnessed its first media revolution. It became global through discoveries of New Worlds. Rulers fought rebels and tried to regularise peoples' behaviour. The Reformation divided Christianity and countries. Witches were prosecuted.The seventeenth century saw the first major European confessional and state war, which lasted for Thirty Years. Law and diplomacy became increasingly important. Concepts of liberty were contested and redefined, so as to meet or query the new ideology of 'reason of state'. The Enlightenment emanated from such debates, as did the early modern experience of negotiating passion and reason, individual needs and the common good.So this is a paper which charts key developments in European history and allows you to engage with many fascinating ideas and people. Carlo Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms, introduces you to an Italian village miller who was burnt by the Inquisition for his heretical ideas, and Natalie Davis' Return of Martin Guerre to a French woman who pretended that her husband was dead in order to live with another man. Then there is 'high culture', with Renaissance feminists, the humanist Montaigne, an extraordinary Venetian rabbi, Leon of Modena, and new seventeenth-century 'scientific' philosophers, such as Descartes. We focus on providing you with lectures and supervisions on topics which give you a coherent sense of the period and let you engage with people's subjectivities and lives.Paper 16 reading listPaper 16 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

That is revealed by the frequent use of the word "revolution" to describe some of its major events - The French Revolution, the Revolutions of 1848, the romantic revolution and the industrial revolution. The roots of another great revolution - the Russian Revolution of 1917 - stretch back deep into the nineteenth century.Other changes such as the "disenchantment of the world" by the Enlightenment, the transformation of the role and position of women, the urbanisation of European society, the rise and fall of Napoleon or the unification of Italy and Germany, were of comparable scale and importance.Virtually all the movements which formed the modern world - secularism, liberalism, Marxism, democracy, romanticism, conservatism, modernism, anarchism, terrorism (to mention just a few) were creations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. No proper understanding of the world in which we live can be achieved without knowledge and understanding of these dramatic times.Always one of the most successful and popular papers in the Tripos, Paper 17 has been restructured to provide students with a course of lectures which:At the heart of the teaching for this paper is a twice-weekly course of lectures given by a team of experts. Beginning with eight core lectures, which identify and explain the central themes in the political, social, economic and cultural history of the period, the course then covers the major events and developments in all these fields.The lectures will Paper 17 course guide and reading listUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

How did Christian thinkers cope intellectually with the extraordinary changes in the political status of the early church? Was Aristotle an apologist for ancient slavery? Why and how did early modern thinkers draw on the inheritance of the ancients in debates over sovereignty and freedom? These are some of the important questions which this paper will enable you to explore, as you encounter some of the classic texts in the origin of Western political thought and come to understand the way that they expressed and engaged with the intellectual controversies and assumptions of their times.Like Paper 20/4, this paper offers two kinds of intellectual adventure. In Part A, you will focus on a close reading of major texts within political and intellectual contexts. This allows you to explore how philosophical argument and analysis emerges within an historical period and so to develop philosophical skills within the Historical Tripos (or Human, Social and Political Sciences Tripos for those borrowing this paper). In Part B, you will focus on groups of texts which are thematically and historically connected, developing your ability to understand the way that a given political language is inflected, used and challenged in specific historical circumstances. For those considering doing other papers in the history of political thought or who have done them, this paper will provide a crucial basis to enrich and deepen your understanding of the foundations of modern politics.Because the material to be covered is both diverse and especially challenging in that many students will not have studied the history of political thought before, more lectures are offered for this paper than for some others. This need not cause you alarm as you are not required or expected to attend them all since you will cover in supervision only 7 or 8 of the 30 named topics, and need answer in the examination only on 3. There is a convention that (at least) one examination question will be set on every named A and B topic. The result of all this is that you have the opportunity in conjunction with your supervisor to chart your own intellectual pathway through this paper. You may choose to concentrate entirely on ancient and medieval material, or on medieval and early modern, or to choose some other combination of thinkers and topics recommended by your supervisor.The Reading List is the invaluable guide and resource which lists all of the topics with specified primary reading and recommended secondary reading. This leaflet is to be read in conjunction with the Reading List and will help you select those lectures which will be most relevant to your chosen topics, as well as those which are closely related, since you will often benefit from attending lectures on topics closely related to your specific supervision topics as well. Note that lectures from other Faculties may be included in this list because the expertise in the history of political thought in Cambridge is shared among several Faculties.The lecturers will Paper 19 reading listPaper 19 course guide   Useful online resourcesPast Papers:Part IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The course examines the early modern expansion of Spain and Portugal into the Caribbean, central and South America and the history of Atlantic slavery. It analyses the 'first age of global imperialism' between 1760 and 1830, when the European powers, and especially the British, began to establish territorial empires in Asia and Africa. It considers the economic, political and strategic reasons behind the Partition of Africa and the battle for concessions in the Far East in the late nineteenth century. But this is not simply a European-centred course. It also examines the indigenous civilisations, economies and states of the Americas, Africa and Asia in their own terms. The resistance and adaptation of non-European peoples to western economic penetration, political dominance and evangelisation occupies centre stage in lectures and supervisions. The course ends with a consideration of Asian and African nationalisms in their early stages.Paper 21 reading listPaper 21 course guideUseful online resourcesPast papers: Prelim to Part IPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The notion of a 'Third World' emerged very much as the legacy of these shaping influences, popularised in the debates of the 1960s and 1970s when the world's states and economies seemed to be very clearly divided between those of the advanced 'West' and the newly independent but still 'underdeveloped' Third World.More recently, social change and economic advance in many of the world's postcolonial societies, particularly in east and southeast Asia, suggest now that we need new and more complex ways of understanding what have become in the later C20, global flows of capital and people, commodities and technologies. In these contexts, labels such as 'Third World', even the 'postcolonial' world, may no longer seem meaningful descriptions of what is a more complex and multicentred global society. Yet these very forces of 'globalisation', with the free play they create for unprecedented convergences of capital, technology and resources, seem to raise again issues of power and marginalisation, dominance and exploitation. As the legacies of older forms of imperialism and nationalism seem to recede into the historical past, categories such as the 'Third World' and the 'postcolonial' world may still therefore serve as important pointers to the inequalities of wealth and power that characterise the modern world.Paper 23 reading listPaper 23 course guideUseful online resourcesPast Papers:Prelim (Paper 19)Part I The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

This is the 'middle' paper of the three papers in the history of political thought but it should not on that account be overlooked. It is arguably the fulcrum on which an understanding of both the others depends.Like Paper 19, this paper offers two kinds of intellectual adventure. In Part A, you will focus on a close reading of major texts within their political and intellectual contexts. This allows you to explore how theoretical argument and analysis about politics emerges within a given historical period and so to develop philosophical skills within the Historical Tripos (or within the Politics Tripos for those borrowing this paper).In Part B, you will focus on particular debates and groups of texts which are thematically and historically connected, developing your ability to understand the way that a given political language is inflected in different ways according to different demands of circumstance and inclinations of intellectual temperament. For those considering doing other papers in the history of political thought or who have done them, this paper will provide a crucial basis to enrich and deepen your understanding of the foundations of modern politics.Because the material to be covered is diverse and especially challenging for many students who will not have studied the history of political thought before, more lectures are offered for this paper than for some others.

The University’s guidelines state that Plagiarism is defined as submitting as one's own work, irrespective of intent to deceive, that which derives in part or in its entirety from the work of others without due acknowledgement. Note that when detected, plagiarism incurs serious penalties, which may extend to a failure to obtain a degree.  In line with University policy (above), the History Faculty also penalizes work which, without constituting plagiarism, still shows poor scholarly practices in failing to acknowledge with adequate clarity the contributions of others.  Such practices include acknowledging the work of historians only partially or citing primary source material you have not actually consulted; there is a full discussion of such practices below.  To avoid such penalties, candidates must leave examiners in no doubt as to which parts of any submission are original, which derivative.Plagiarism can utilise many sources and media (books, journals, newspapers, websites, unpublished material, illustrations, data, and the work of other students).  It can be distinguished in the following ways:Self-evidently, historical research and writing are, in varying ways, collaborative.  All historians use original sources, habitually refer to the work of other historians, converse and debate, and hence, in order to demarcate what is original from what is derivative, conventions have developed.  These include:Plagiarism and poor scholarly practice frequently arise from inadvertence.  In the course of your undergraduate career, you will make many notes on lectures, on various printed texts, even on conversations in supervisions and classes.  In such notes, it is important to distinguish between the ideas and language of others, and your own thoughts and language, or else it can be easy – after the lapse of months or even years – to forget who said what, and to imagine that what is borrowed from others is your own.Traditionally, supervision essays were unannotated, as, by necessity, are all scripts in three-hour unseen examinations, but word-processing makes it easier for you to acquire the scholarly habits of furnishing footnotes and bibliographies in weekly essays.   In all circumstances it is imperative to place inverted commas around quotations and to attribute ideas to their original authors in your written text.The Faculty style guide, which explains how to do footnotes and bibliographies in essays and dissertations, can be found here.The following examples, drawn from Dr. Horrox’s handout, will help to show how these conventions work in practice.A passage in Rosemary Horrox, “Service”, in Horrox, ed., Fifteenth-Century Attitudes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 61, reads:Service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.  This essay is mainly concerned with the social and political manifestations of service, but it is important to recognize that these rested upon attitudes which were very deeply rooted in medieval society.  That society, to a degree which modern readers sometimes find disconcerting, was based on hierarchy.  Human society, mirroring the whole created universe, was arranged in order of importance.  There is no doubt that this orderliness was found satisfying in itself.  Medieval writing bears witness to a passion for arranging things in order and for resolving all the possible ambiguities and contradictions which might arise.  The minutely detailed lists of precedence to be found in late medieval courtesy books reflect not only a sense that it was socially important to seat people in the right order at the dinner table, but a sheer pleasure in working out the minutiae of relative statusIf, in the following manner, you used this passage without attribution and quotation marks, even if the wording is slightly varied, you would be a plagiarist:Service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.  It rested upon attitudes which were very deeply rooted in medieval society.  Society was based on hierarchy and arranged in order of importance.  The lists of precedence to be found in late medieval courtesy books reflect not only a sense that it was socially important to seat people in the right order at the dinner table, but pleasure in working out relative status.Acknowledging the source in the narrative, but implying that your narrative is independent of the source and, by omitting annotation, making it difficult for your larceny to be detected, is no less plagiarism.  The following example constitutes an abuse because it implies that only the idea expressed in the first sentence is owed to Dr Horrox’s article and that what follows is the candidate’s own train of thought:Horrox has made the point that service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.  We can see that it rested upon attitudes which were very deeply rooted in medieval society.  Society was based on hierarchy and arranged in order of importance.  The lists of precedence to be found in late medieval courtesy books reflect not only a sense that it was socially important to seat people in the right order at the dinner table, but pleasure in working out relative status.This is an especially noteworthy example because it illustrates a common failing in undergraduate work, a failure which is often the result of careless rather than intentionally evasive writing. By contrast, compare the following paragraph which avoids plagiarism because it quotes Horrox directly and provides annotation: As Horrox has said, “Service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.”  This is because “society, to a degree which modern readers sometimes find disconcerting, was based on hierarchy.  Human society, mirroring the whole created universe, was arranged in order of importance”.  She further suggests that “this orderliness was found satisfying in itself” and uses the example of late medieval courtesy books to demonstrate this “sheer pleasure in working out the minutiae of relative status”.2This is far from model academic prose, however. By carefully dismembering Dr Horrox’s sentences and attributing each component to her our hypothetical author is safe from the charge of plagiarism. But this formulation still implies a selectivity which is in fact illusory because nothing of any substance has been omitted from the original. It would be better, because more succinct and considered, to write:Horrox has argued that “service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages”.  She links this to the contemporary emphasis on hierarchy, as reflected in the courtesy books.3Still better, because it shows understanding of the source and takes a critical position, would be:Horrox has argued that “service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages”, but the discussion which follows is concerned only with male manifestations of service. 4 If we consider the role of women . . .Another unacceptable and fairly common habit is derivative citation without clear acknowledgement. This is poor scholarly practice for two reasons. First, it implies that you have read material which you have not. Secondly, it tends to downplay the role of the modern historian whose work contains the references. You commit this error if your footnote reads:Stains, Lucubrations on the State of the Nation, Boston 1860 instead of giving the extra information required:       Obadiah Stains, Lucubrations on the State of the Nation, Boston 1860, as cited by Nemo Niemand in his article mentioned above, note 7.The same standard of transparency applies to modern secondary literature: if you haven’t read it but are citing it at one remove via another piece of academic work, you MUST cite it as known to you BY THAT ROUTE, as in the following example:       E. Cortese, La norma giuridica, vol. 1, pp. 166-8, as cited by Nemo Niemand in his article ‘Law            and Politics’, p. 7[1] This document draws upon the University-wide statement on plagiarism, and Dr Rosemary Horrox’s handout, given to first-year undergraduates in a Study Skills session, provided by the Faculty of History.[2] Rosemary Horrox, “Service”, in Horrox, ed., Fifteenth-Century Attitudes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 61.[3] Ibid.[4] Ibid. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

So long as the guidelines set out in Section I are observed, students may choose from any documented style for footnotes and bibliography, on condition that they apply it sensibly and consistently. They may wish to consult, for example, the style adopted by journals in the field of their submission, or the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), or the compact version thereof in Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, 8th ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013).This latitude for style choice has been introduced because academic styles vary widely among different journals and publishers, and it would be misleading to require students to adhere to a single system as if that were likely to be the only system required of them in the future. What students need to learn is to be consistent and clear in their use of any given style, and this is what the combination of compulsion and flexibility in this guide seeks to inculcate.Dates should be written in the form: 20 December 1148; 20 December; AD 245-50. Centuries should be written out (twenty-first century) and 1920s etc. should be written without an apostrophe.As explained in the introduction to this document, whereas the rules in Section I are compulsory, the style conventions given in this section (Section II) are recommended only. Section II outlines a style which you may choose to adopt for footnotes and bibliography, but you are not required to do so. This style has been adapted from the Cambridge University Press Humanities & Social Sciences Book Production Guide, drawing also at points on the Historical Journal notes for authors, with certain changes, additions and deletions to make it more practicable for undergraduates.The Cambridge University Press Guide for Humanities and Social Sciences at https://authornet.cambridge.org/information/productionguide/hss/ is normally available online. If you choose to use this style, you may consult the Guide for additional information on minor points, so long as in any case of conflict between the Guide and Section I of this document you follow the latter. You may alter the style for your own purposes so long as you are consistent (for example, medievalists and early modernists often omit the name of the publisher as this is either irrelevant or unknown for manuscripts and for early printed books). Alternatively, you may use any other consistent and documented style that you choose so long as you adhere to the requirements in Section I. At the risk of repetition, it must be stressed that the crucial issue is consistency within a single piece of work.The style convention for footnotes given here is to give a full reference at the first citation, and then author-plus-short-title in subsequent citations. The examples below use lower case in titles except for proper nouns; this should always be followed in the case of French and Latin titles, but in English and German titles either upper case or lower case may be used for non-trivial words in book titles.First (or ‘full’) reference to books, articles, and manuscript source may be given as in the following examples (you may choose between giving authors’ names exactly as in their works, and using initials-plus-surname for all authors), giving where relevant the specific page number(s) to which you are referring:(Aldershot: Variorum, 1995).A. T. Runnock, Medieval fortress building, new edn, 2 vols., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), vol. I, pp.135-7. [Here ‘pp.135-7’ are the specific pages to which reference is being made; there is alternatively a different convention, of dropping the ‘p.’ or ‘pp.’ when a volume number is cited, as it is here.]Charles Taylor, ‘The hermeneutics of conflict’, in Meaning and context: Quentin Skinner and his critics, ed. James Tully (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988), 218-28. [Here ‘218-28’ is the complete page range of the chapter.]Journal articles:Essays and Studies 11 (1958), 34-48. [Here ‘11’ is the volume number, which must be given, and ‘34-48’ is the complete page range of the article. As the Salter example shows, it is not necessary to give the journal issue number or month in addition to the volume. If you do decide to adopt a convention of giving either issue number or month (which must be done consistently), omit the other: so either Journal of American History 91:4 (2005), or Journal of American History 91 (March 2005), but not Journal of American History 91:4 (March 2005).]Arthur Jerrold Tieje, ‘A peculiar phase of the theory of realism in pre-Richardsonian fiction’, PMLA 28 (1913), 213-52, at p.214. [Here PMLA would have to have been explained in an abbreviations list, otherwise spelt out here at first reference.]Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh, 15 December 1748, ‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, Forster collection, XI, fol. 7, Harvard University.H. R. Southall, ‘Regional unemployment patterns in Britain, 1851 to 1914’, unpublished PhD thesis, University of Cambridge (1984), p. 72.Use common sense to construct a consistent system of referencing. Include the date produced and for films, the country and director. Example: Kate Nickerson [Arnold Manoff nom de plume], writer, and Sidney Lumet, director, ‘The Death of Socrates: 399 B.C.’, episode of ‘You Are There’, CBS, national USA broadcast, 3 May 1953.After the first mention, references to the source in the notes should take a shortened form. A shortened reference includes only the last name of the author and an improvised short title for the book (containing the key word or words from the main title, so as to make the reference easily recognisable and not to be confused with any other work), followed by the page number of the reference. Thus:Books:Rousseau and Rogers (eds.), Enduring legacy, p. 45. Runnock, Medieval fortress building, p. 74.Articles:Salter, ‘Pilgrimage to truth’, pp.34-5. Tieje, ‘A peculiar phase’, p.75.Manuscript material:Southall, ‘Regional unemployment’, p. 72.‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, fol. 116.BN n.a.fr. 20628 (Thiers Papers), fol. 279.The author may be separated from the short title, e.g. in footnote formulations such as:You may choose to use ‘Ibid.’ [no italics] to refer to the work mentioned in the immediately preceding reference, so long as there is no danger of confusion.So:But not: The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It encourages students to raise and discuss fundamental questions that relate their specialist knowledge to more general themes of historical inquiry and explanation.The focus of HAP is on understanding the conceptual, historiographical and methodological dimensions of historical argument and practice. It is a summative paper, that requires candidates to forge connections between different aspects of their historical knowledge, for example by critically evaluating the merits of different approaches in relation to the more specific and empirical material that they have encountered elsewhere in their study of the past.HAP is a compulsory element of Part II History and typically counts for 20% of the final degree. It is also a necessary requirement of those students who appear on the successful list of candidates for the Prelim to Part I.There is no fundamental difference between the paper set for the Prelim and that set for Part II, although examiners will inevitably expect a higher level of knowledge and sophistication from candidates sitting the latter. At both levels, the paper is assessed by means of a three-hour examination, in which candidates are required to answer only one question. The exam paper, which normally consists of around 30 questions, is designed to encourage broad discussion of issues derived from, and relevant to the full range of papers offered by the Faculty.  Candidates are also encouraged to draw upon their wider reading.The best way of viewing the Prelim paper is as a dry-run for Part II: an early opportunity to experiment with making the sorts of broader connections and comparisons that are not always possible in the context of the other more specialized Part I papers.Students should begin to consider issues relating to HAP from their first year of study and continue to develop their ideas as they move through their various Part I and Part II papers. Although there is no formal exam of HAP in Part I, second-years are encouraged to keep thinking about HAP and to make a point of attending at least 8 lectures during the course of the year.Past papers are available here [Cambridge only].In deciding which lectures to attend in which year, all students are advised to consult with their Directors of Studies. The programme of lectures, which is open to History undergraduates in all years, comprises two sets of hour-long lectures given by members of the Faculty’s teaching staff:In addition, a series of classes, led by graduate students and open to Part II undergraduates (only), will cover the same themes explored in the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lectures (see further information for Part II students). Graduate led classes will cover the same themes explored in the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lectures. The purpose of the classes is to give Part II students the opportunity to follow up the ideas aired in the lectures, to supplement the lecture with some reading, and to participate actively in discussion. The classes will last about 90 minutes and will be capped at 20 undergraduates (parallel sessions will be run for popular topics). The classes will proceed during Lent in a sequence that follows the themes in the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lecture series. Classes are not mandatory, but students are strongly encouraged to attend classes for up to three Concepts and Problems lectures. Information will be circulated during Michaelmas, and registration for these classes will open in the latter part of Michaelmas term. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

These involve a different style of study from the weekly essay. Undergraduates select a Special Subject from a list of options. This gives the opportunity for advanced study in depth of an important historical process or problem. Teaching is by Faculty lectures and/or classes, spread across the third year. Undergraduates are expected to do the reading in their own time. The reading concentrates on primary sources, again of a variety of types.The Special Subject constitutes two of the five papers (Papers 2 and 3) on a one-year Part II course - 40% of the total. Work for your Special Subject is examined by means of a Long Essay (Paper 2) submitted during the Easter Term and a three-hour exam on 'gobbets' taken from the set sources (Paper 3) in late May/early June.The list of Special Subjects available for any particular year are listed under the Part II papers.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

These involve a different style of study from the weekly essay. Teaching takes place in classes at regular intervals in the last two terms of the first year. Presentations by option teachers are held in the first teaching week of Michaelmas term, after which first year undergraduates are asked to choose their option.Options typically take a broad theme in comparative history (such as gender, race, Christianity or film) and investigate continuities and changes over time. Several options are based on a close reading of primary source material, and examine the problems involved in using such sources.Other options explore big themes over long periods of time; or there may be a combination of theme-based and source-based approaches. Some options may also involve the use of visual material. Those who have followed source-based courses at school will find these approaches quite familiar.Themes and Sources is a compulsory paper in Part I (Paper 1), and is assessed by means of a Long Essay (3000-5000 words) on one of a variety of set questions. This involves extensive individual research. It is set in May of the first year and submitted in January of the second year, so most of the work for it is done in the intervening vacations. Long essay questions will be available here on Thursday 24 May 2018 Information relating to Themes and Sources options taught 2016-2018 can be found here (Cambridge University only)  Themes and Sources Long Essay GuidanceFaculty Style GuideGuidance on plagiarismThemes and Sources Past Papers Long Essay cover sheets and declaration form (available Easter Term) © 2017 University of Cambridge

After a brief tour of the armoury gallery, Senior Technician Andrew Maloney took the group behind the scenes into the museum's Applied Arts department. Wearing their protective purple gloves, students handled a variety of objects dating back to the sixteenth century, including fragments of mail, a breast and back plate, gauntlets, greaves, and tassets. From Bartels, they learned about the materiality, construction, and function of both mail and plate armour while handling and inspecting these items up close. Decorative techniques such as etching, bluing, embossing, and gilding were similarly examined. Students also explored the iconographic themes most commonly found on early modern armour and in small groups, dissected the mythological and Christian imagery adorning a beautiful German breast plate from the museum's permanent display. Their visit concluded by looking at weapons, including a mace, a rapier, and a hunting sword with its scabbard.Photos: Victoria BartelsThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Faculty of HistoryStudying at Cambridge Workshops are your chance to meet other people researching in related areas, to learn about their work, and to get a chance to present your own research to an interested audience.Workshops are one of the very strong points of the Faculty's graduate programme. Some are thematic, some are period-based; all bring together MPhil and graduate students to discuss and present their work in a supportive peer environment. Many workshops also pursue projects such as conference panels and colloquia, and most become friend groups. Some offer sandwiches, some insist on wine. All provide a lively environment to meet other historians working on topics which are at least marginally related.We have three thematic workshops which run on a yearly basis. Each year, there are three places for thematic workshops for which graduate students can apply (including the current thematic workshops, which only run for a year at a time). The call for workshop Proposals usually opens in early Lent - more details will be provided soon. Please contact the Grad Rep for any more information, and we look forward to reading your workshop proposals.Grad Rep: gradrep@hist.cam.ac.uk Meet the WorkshopsSession Leader: all the convenors of the Graduate Workshops, Grad Rep Meet the Grad Rep and find out about the workshops available within the Faculty. Workshops are an excellent way to test out ideas among peers in a research-friendly environment.  The workshops are a great place to fine-tune a paper for a conference presentation, and to test ideas. Neither presentation nor even participation are mandatory, but any PhD student who fails to get involved in at least one workshop is really missing out on a useful, exciting, and fun part of the faculty's grad programme.All workshop programmes are available on the Graduate Training Google calendar. Workshop organisation is another great experience - and good for the CV. Sign up for the mailing lists that each workshop runs by emailing the workshop convenor or visiting the 'Meet the Workshops' session at the beginning of the year. If you have a personal Google account you can also tell the calendar to text or email you when workshop events are about to happen. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open. For full information for applicants please see the Research funding webpage.  Film show: To Sir with Love (1967)

We travelled together into the city and made our way to the Royal Academy of Arts where we saw the exhibition 'America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s.' The exhibit brought together paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, Philip Guston, Edward Hopper and more. The most well-known of the collection was Grant Wood's American Gothic, which is on display for the first time outside of North America. Overall 'America after the Fall' was an illuminating experience, and it was worthwhile to see how artists during the 1930s were thinking about the past, present and future of America. Half of our group had spent the term taking an option class titled 'Immigration, Race and American Nationality,' where we read a lot of primary sources grappling with the question of what it means to be American. It was interesting to see those same ideas being worked out through the paintings in the exhibition, and a useful reminder that it can be productive for historians to dip their toes in the realm of art history. The exhibition was organised by the Art Institute of Chicago in collaboration with the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and Établissement public du musée d'Orsay et du musée de l'Orangerie, Paris, and is on display until 4 June 2017.After the exhibition we made our way to the British Library, where we got lunch in the café and ate outside on the patio to enjoy the sunshine and beautiful spring weather. We then had a session led by two members of the Eccles Centre for American Studies team at the Library. Some of our group had used the British Library collections before and others had not, but it was a useful session for all of us as they gave us a good overview of the kinds of materials in the Library's American collections, which are really very vast. We also heard about fellowships offered by the Centre, as well as additional events they run like lectures and workshops. After the presentation a couple people who wanted to had the opportunity to sign up for reader passes to the Library, and then we made our way back to Cambridge. Overall is was a very full and fun day, and it was nice to celebrate the end of classes while simultaneously taking a break from our essays and dissertations. Many thanks to Emily and Seth for organizing the trip - we all had a great time!The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The conditions for achieving a Distinction in each M.Phil vary and are explained in Section 4.Work qualifying for a mark of 75 or better will clearly meet or exceed all or almost all of the requirements for an M.Phil dissertation. It will be ambitious in scope, show depth of research and sophistication of conceptual understanding, and be of high quality in its argument, while being aware of any necessary limits to its findings.MPhil dissertation examiners should not hesitate to award marks of 75 and upwards, including marks in the 80s, if they feel it appropriate.  Examiners should bear in mind that even the best of MPhil candidates are just at the beginning of their scholarly careers, in many cases producing their first piece of sustained scholarly work.Marks of 70 to 74 are awarded for work of high quality, which nevertheless falls below the level required for a Distinction. These marks clearly support leave to continue to the PhD.Work qualifying for these marks will comfortably meet all or the majority of the requirements for an M.Phil. dissertation, demonstrating some or all of ambition in the choice of topic, depth of research and conceptual understanding, quality of argument and a due awareness of the limits to its findings.Marks of 67 to 69 are strong marks which will help the candidate securely to pass the course but will normally exclude leave to continue to the PhD.Work qualifying for these marks will meet the majority of the requirements for an M.Phil. dissertation, demonstrating a measure of  ambition in the choice of topic, depth of research, conceptual understanding, and quality of argument, as well as an awareness of the limits to its findings.Marks of 63 to 66 are solid but medium-range marks.Work qualifying for these marks will satisfy the basic requirements for an M.Phil. dissertation, demonstrating  an appropriate choice of topic, some depth of research and quality of argument, as well as an awareness of the limits to its findings.Marks of 60 to 62 are weak pass marks which indicate that the work deserves a bare pass in itself but is not strong enough to offer compensating support should other work be of marginal fail quality.Work awarded these marks will barely satisfy the requirements for an M.Phil. dissertation. It will have a potentially appropriate topic, be the product of some research, advance a coherent argument, and show some awareness of the limits to its findings.Marks of 59 and below indicate work which falls below the requirements set out above; the implications of these marks are very serious and must be understood: see below for Marginal Failure and Failure.Weaknesses which suggest the award of a marginal fail or fail mark include: an inadequately or inappropriately-defined topic; insufficient research; the absence of coherent argument; claims of findings which manifestly exceed the evidence and argumentation adduced.A mark of 59 is a marginal fail mark, which may be redeemable by evidence of more than borderline performance overall in Part I of the course. In awarding a mark of 59 an examiner is indicating that the dissertation alone is not sufficient evidence that the candidate should pass the course, but that it is sufficiently close to passing that evidence of reasonably strong performance elsewhere in the course would warrant the award of the MPhil degree.In the case of one examiner awarding a Marginal Fail (59) and the other a Pass (60 or above), the dissertation will be marked by the External Examiner.  The External Examiner will examine and award a mark independently, without reference to the marks already awarded, but will have the marks and reports of the initial examiners available for consultation in preparing his or her independent report.  Whenever possible, the External Examiner’s mark should give a clear recommendation of Pass or Fail.  If the third mark is a Pass the candidate is deemed to have passed and the marginal fail mark will be discarded.  If the third mark is a Marginal or an outright Fail, a viva will be held (see section 17.3 on viva voce examinations).  In the case of both examiners awarding a Marginal Fail, the External Examiner is also asked to examine the dissertation independently, and award a mark.  If this third mark is a Pass, a viva will be held.  If the third mark is a Marginal or outright Fail, the candidate will be deemed to have failed.If the outcome of a viva is itself a marginal fail mark of 59, this would constitute a ‘marginal fail’ of Part II of the MPhil (dissertation), and point 3(b) of the Student Registry ‘Memorandum to Examiners and Assessors for the Degree of Master of Philosophy (one-year course) would apply, giving the Degree Committee discretion to judge whether the essays in Part I taken as a whole had achieved what the Memorandum calls ‘high performance’ and to take this into account in recommending a pass to the Student Registry.  Such ‘high performance’ would for this course be constituted by a set of essay marks none of which falls under 63 (and excluding for this purpose any mark of 59 which was not confirmed by a third marker). Conversely, agreed dissertation marks (or a post-viva third mark) of 63 and above may be used to compensate a marginal fail in Part I.Failure: In the case of one Pass and one Fail mark (i.e. 58 or below) from the initial examiners, the dissertation is sent to the External Examiner to award a third mark. If the third mark is a clear Pass, the dissertation will be deemed to have passed.  If that marker awards a Fail mark (i.e. 58 or below), the candidate will be deemed to have failed.  If the third mark is a Marginal Fail, a viva will be held. The External Examiner will examine and award marks independently, without reference to the marks already awarded, although the initial examiners’ marks and reports will be made available to the External Examiner, to enable his or her report to take account of them.  Whenever possible, the third reader’s mark should give a clear recommendation of Pass or Fail.In the event of two clear failing marks, the candidate will be deemed to have failed.In each case where a candidate is deemed to have failed, a viva may be held, but only if the candidate wishes it.  Candidates must be informed of their right to request a viva in such cases.  In the event of two low failing marks, it is appropriate to advise the student that a conversion of the fail to a passing mark, though theoretically possible, is in practice highly unlikely.Referral of the dissertation for further work and for re-examination at a later date is not permitted for MPhil dissertations. A fail mark (58 or below; or uncompensated marginal fail mark of 59) confirmed after the viva is grounds for failure of the MPhil course overall.  The MPhil Sub-Committee sitting as Board of Examiners will make a recommendation to this effect to the Degree Committee of the Faculty of History.  A failed candidate, however, may at the discretion of the Degree Committee receive a Certificate of Attendance or be transferred to postulate for the Certificate of Postgraduate Study.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

This is usually an academic who is expert in a field relevant to the MPhil, usually from another UK University.The External Examiner will randomly sample work throughout the programme to ensure parity of marking and standards. They may also be called upon to independently third mark written work where work is borderline, i.e. one mark falls above and one below the Fail mark (59), Leave to continue qualifying mark (70), the Distinction mark (75), or where marks show  ‘manifest divergence’ (a difference of  9 marks or more).The External Examiner will initially read the dissertation without reference to the two original examiners’ reports and provide an independent third mark, but will also in his or her report comment on the relevant areas of disagreement between the two original reports (which should be referred to anonymously) and the judgements reached therein. The third mark will be dispositive in questions of eligibility for a Distinction or for Leave to continue, and in all cases of failure or compensation.  All three marks are recorded in the candidate’s file by the MPhil Sub-Committee sitting as Board of Examiners.All three marks will appear on the candidate’s Transcript, except in cases where an initial partial fail or fail mark was recorded but not confirmed by the External Examiner, in which case the partial fail or fail mark shall be dropped from the transcript.Should they be members of the MPhil Sub-Committee sitting as Board of Examiners, neither the supervisor nor any examiner (except the External Examiner) of a given dissertation shall vote on any question arising about that dissertation.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Viva voce examinations (which normally last for thirty minutes) are held at a predetermined date (usually the day or the day before the Board of Examiners meet).  All candidates are informed of this date well in advance.  Unauthorised absence of a candidate from a viva implies a failure in the dissertation examination.  Postponement of the viva will be allowed by the MPhil Sub-Committee only on the most serious (e.g. medical) grounds.  If this happens the viva examiners will be notified immediately.If necessary, the Academic Secretary or Chair, or MPhil Director of the MPhil Sub-Committee will call a viva voce examination by the two examiners of the dissertation jointly with the External Examiner.  The viva voce examiners (including the External Examiner) must submit a joint written report to the MPhil Sub-Committee sitting as Board of Examiners and may recommend the raising of dissertation examination marks to pass level or higher. If a joint report is not possible and the two original examiners remain in disagreement after the viva, the view of the External Examiner (who will be present at the viva and have read the dissertation) will prevail. It should be noted that the normal expectation is that marks will not be reduced as the result of a viva. Confidential minutes of the viva examination will be taken either by the Academic Secretary or Chair of the MPhil or by the Director of Graduate Training, or, if these are not available, by the Director of Graduate Studies.  The officer attending in this capacity will be present at the viva only as an observer and will not participate in the discussion.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

These abbreviations should be listed on a page at the beginning of the submission, which as stated above does not count toward the word limit. Examples are EHR (English Historical Review), MGHSS (Monumenta Germaniae Historica Scriptores).These should be avoided in the text unless they are well known and serve a useful purpose.No full stop is necessary where the contraction includes the first and last letter of the singular Mr, Dr, Mme, St, or an abbreviation of SI (metric) units.  The plural of m, kg, and other SI abbreviations is the same as the singular.  The stop may also be omitted in sets of initials pronounced as a word (e.g. NATO, UNESCO).Be consistent in your use of ‘per cent’ and ‘%’: we suggest that you use ‘per cent’ in the text but ‘%’ in tables.Stops are used in c. fol. fols. C.O. M.P.s  U.S.A. P.R.O. F.O. W.O. H. of C. B.L. but not for MS MSS v (verso) r (recto) 2nd edn.Websites should be cited in roman without angle brackets: http://www.cambridge.org.Although some authorities now counsel that there is no need to give the date of access to a site, the DNB and other important historical sources recommend it in view of frequent updating, and so you should include it, adapting the following form as appropriate:John Morrill, ‘Cromwell, Oliver (1599-1658)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765, accessed 15 June 2007].However, you should avoid citing websites where unnecessary, e.g. where a manuscript or source is readily available in print. To cite an interview that you have conducted, give the name of the person interviewed (unless the interviewee has asked to remain anonymous), the kind of interview (e.g. Personal interview, Telephone interview), and the date, for example:1 Gordon Brown. Personal Interview. 25 December 2009.The interview should also be listed in the bibliography, where it may be suitable to provide more detail on the nature and circumstances of the interview (for example venue and duration).It is recommended that you do not use more than three types of heading within a chapter.Short quotations should be enclosed in single inverted commas, except for quotations within quotations which have double inverted commas, and should run on with the main text in double-spacing.  However, quotations extending to more than five lines of typescript ought to be distinguished from the rest of the text and do not need inverted commas (except for quotations within quotations).  Start each such quotation on a fresh line and indent the whole quotation (say five spaces from the margin) and type in single-spacing; the first line of any new paragraphs after the beginning of the quotation should be indented a further five spaces.The purpose of footnotes is primarily to refer the reader to the sources upon which statements are made.  It is essential that the reader should be able to identify quickly the particular sources for particular statements.  If it is convenient to gather together the evidence for sequences of statements, or a sequence of examples illustrating a statement, it is perfectly proper to put these into a single note.  However, in such cases the sequence in the notes must follow the sequence in the text precisely. If there is any risk that a reader will not be able immediately to identify a particular source for each statement, then separate notes should be given.  If in doubt, use more rather than fewer separate notes.There are two alternative systems of inserting references.  You cannot mix them for published references, but must choose one or the other and stick to it. You would do well to acclimatize yourself early to whichever sort of system is used by the journals in which you might hope eventually to publish some of your conclusions.  The Historical Journal, for example, uses traditional footnotes.Traditional footnote systemThe traditional method is that the first reference to a document or work in each chapter should be punctuated, spelt out and capitalised as in the following examples: Cardwell to Russell, 3 Nov. 1865, London, National Archives (N.A.), Russell Papers, 30/22/1466, f. 23.John Morley, The life of William Ewart Gladstone (2 vols., London, 1988 edn.), I, 42, 121-34.M. Cowling, 1867: Disraeli, Gladstone and revolution: the passing of the second Reform Bill (Cambridge, 1967),  pp.41-5, 140-7, 151-62.C.M. Williams, ‘The political career of Henry Marten’ (unpublished D.Phil. dissertation, University of Oxford, 1954).W.G. Hynes, ‘British mercantile attitudes towards imperial expansion’, Historical Journal, XIX, 4 (1976), 969-76.Select committee on manufactures, commerce and shipping (Parl. Papers, 1833, VI), Q3326.and that the second and later references should be given in the appropriate abbreviated form (see below).Since you should already have full description of your sources in the bibliography, you may, if you wish, use abbreviated versions for all your footnotes, except for manuscript references, which must appear in full.  You must be consistent and avoid ambiguity.  Add volume (if more than one).  It is usual to include ‘p.’ (or ‘pp.’ if more than one page) before page numbers, but only if there is no volume number.  It is also usual to shorten the second number (except those between 11 and 19) in a pair of page numbers, e.g. pp. 508-9, 512-16.The references should be punctuated as in the following examples:Hazel, The growth of the cotton trade, III, 2.Carr, ‘Uncertainty and monetary theory’, p. 82.Do not use op. cit. and loc. cit. but only your standardised abbreviated form of reference.  Use ibid to indicate that you are referring to the same item as that mentioned last, but remember that you may need another page reference.When referring to a foliated work, use ‘fol.’, ‘fols.’ or ‘f.’, ‘ff.’ for folios; ‘r’ and ‘v’ for ‘recto’ and ‘verso’ should not be raised or underlined.Check your footnotes against the bibliography because it will confuse and irritate the reader if the details given are not the same.  Use as few capitals as possible in book, journal and article titles, and be consistent.Provide at the beginning of the thesis a list of any abbreviations used in the footnotes or in the bibliography and any special symbols that you have employed.Footnotes must appear at the foot of the page to which they refer, in single-spaced typescript.Author-date systemThis can be used either in brackets in the text or in the ordinary way in footnotes: the use in text is normally only suitable for some fields of social and economic history.The normal form is ‘Darcy 1920. pp. 131-8’ – author’s name, date and reference; if the references are in the text, they are in brackets ‘(Darcy 1920, pp.131-8)’.  Possible alternatives include ‘Darcy (1920), pp.131-8)’. or ‘Darcy 1920: 131-8’ omitting the ‘pp.’.If the references are in the text another variant can occur: ‘the analysis of straw hat manufacture at Gamlingay by Darcy (1920, pp.131-8)’.  If the author published two or more works in one year, these are labelled ‘1920a’ etc.Manuscript References must appear in full as in the Traditional Footnote system.When explanatory notes are needed they must appear at the foot of the page, not in brackets in the text.The names of two joint authors are always given.  Three and four joint authors are always given in full the first time and thereafter et al. may be used.  Five or more names can be given as et al. from the start.Where several references are cited together in the text they may be placed in alphabetical or chronological order, or in order of importance, but the same system should be used throughout.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The main text, bibliography, and any other prefatory or appended materials should use 11 or 12 point font. Footnotes may use 10, 11 or 12 point font.Margins should be at least 2.5cm on each side. The main text should be left justified but not right justified.All pages should be numbered, with the exception of prefatory material (the title page, table of contents, and any acknowledgement page or abbreviations list) and the first page of full text. These numbers should be in the top right hand corner of each page and should not be preceded by any ‘p.’ or followed by a full stop.Avoid ‘widows and orphans’: that is, headings, single words, or single lines of text that dangle, separated from the rest of the section to which they belong, at the top or bottom of a page. You may insert additional line spaces to avoid such occurrences.Dissertations should include a table of contents on a separate page, which lists the title, chapter titles, and any sub-sections, giving for each the page number on which it begins (without any ‘p.’ or full stop associated with that number).You are permitted by The Student Registry to print the thesis on both sides of A4 paper, the Faculty preference though is for it to be printed on one side of A4 paper (via a laser printer or a good inkjet printer).  You may wish to make use of the laser printing facilities provided in the Faculty's Graduate Research Room.The main principle for presentation of an essay or thesis is that your style is consistent throughout the document.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

When the thesis is submitted for examination, a note from the student should be enclosed; recording which option was agreed between student and supervisor, for the attention of the examiners.Some dissertations will rely on sources written in scripts other than the Latin alphabet. In some cases, there are accepted conventions: for instance,However, the appropriate treatment of quotations from non-Latin scripts may vary depending on the nature of the language or languages and on the character and field of the dissertation.  Therefore, the decision about handling transliteration issues must be taken by the student in consultation with the supervisor.As the research design takes shape, the student and supervisor should reach an explicit agreement about how foreign language material is to be handled.

However, for each specified word count, the same guidelines as to how to calculate the word count apply.The word count must be strictly observed. Students can expect to be penalized for exceeding or falling short of the prescribed word limits. Normally the penalty will be up to 5 marks but in severe cases the dissertation may be marked as failed. No penalty will be imposed for an excess of up to 150 words below or over the maximum word limit, but this allowance should not be abused.The word count includes:Statistical graphs, charts, and tables, which should be counted at 150 words per page.  The word count excludes:    Calculating and verifying the word count: the word count should be conducted on the main body of the text, excluding prefatory material and bibliography, and setting the 'word count' tool to exclude footnotes from the word count.

There is no automatic continuation from the MPhil to the PhD, although fewer documents are required for the application process. We can this applying for ‘leave to continue’ to the PhD.If you are interested in doctoral study we recommend that you discuss this with your Supervisor who will be able to support you through your application.The funding deadlines for the PhD (here at Cambridge but also other Universities) close very early in the year, with deadlines for International students falling as early as November so we would encourage you to think early about your intentions for doctoral study.MPhil students will usually be expected to achieve an overall grade of 70, with a grade of 70 from both examiners in the dissertation, in order to progress to the PhD.Information about the PhD and how to apply can be found on the following weblinks:http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/prospective-graduates/courses/phd-fulltimehttp://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/how-do-i-applyhttp://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/how-do-i-apply/continuation-and-readmissionThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

This should then be forwarded to Director of Graduate Studies (dgs@hist.cam.ac.uk), for final approval.Ethical considerations, including the protection of sources, are central to the exercise of responsible research using interview methods. To this end the Faculty has put in place a procedure for approval. This is outlined below, alongside some initial advice on the handling of oral history materials.  The full procedure is available on the Faculty’s website:http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/graduate-students/notes-on-approved-style-for-history-phd-dissertations-1/oral-history      The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

If a candidate has any outstanding queries, clarification should be sought from her or his Director of Studies, Course Director or Supervisor as appropriate.Failure to conform to the expected standards of scholarship (e.g. by not referencing sources) in examinations may affect the mark given to the candidate’s work. In addition, suspected cases of the use of unfair means (of which plagiarism is one form) will be investigated and may be brought to one of the University’s Courts. The Courts have wide powers to discipline those found guilty of using unfair means in an examination, including depriving such persons of membership of the University, and deprivation of a degree.The University’s plagiarism and good academic practice website (www.cam.ac.uk/plagiarism) provides more information and guidance.All students will be asked to sign a declaration when submitting written work confirming that the work submitted is their own, and agreeing for the work to be run through ‘turnitin’ if required.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Your supervisor will have expertise in your research area and will offer advice on all aspects of research and preparation of the dissertation.He or she and the MPhil Director are the main points of contact for academic support throughout your MPhil Programme. At college you will also have access to a College Graduate Tutor, who can advise on pastoral matters including financial matters, and matters connected to your welfare and accommodation in Cambridge.Students will meet their Supervisor regularly for one-on-one supervisions in each of the three terms throughout the course. Their number of meetings might vary depending on your project, but students will typically meet twice in the first term and two - three times in subsequent terms. In addition, the MPhil Director for your course will also arrange group or individual meetings with you.Students are admitted to the MPhil to work on their project with a named supervisor. If a student’s research topic changes substantially it may be necessary to try and find an alternative supervisor if possible. In some cases a second supervisor may be assigned to a student to offer additional support in a particular research area.The Faculty hope that your working relationship with your Supervisor will be a successful one throughout your time at Cambridge, but in the unlikely event that a student experiences difficulties or a Supervisor is no longer available to supervise, the MPhil Director and Sub-Committee will discuss suitable alternatives and may allocate a new supervisor where necessary.   The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

But the MPhil does seek to support and develop candidates' work by close personal supervision, by training in research techniques, by an intermediate essay with feedback from two readers and (in some subject areas) by workshops on research in progress.At the heart of the MPhil is the close working relationship between candidate and supervisor.  While the final thesis must be the candidate’s independent work, it is the supervisor who offers advice on refining the topic (if necessary), on primary sources, on secondary reading, on research techniques and on writing the final thesis. Supervisors and candidates meet frequently throughout the year, and the supervisor is always the candidate’s primary contact for academic advice and support.  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

We hope that this handbook will help guide you through the course and give you an idea of what is expected. If you cannot find the answer you are looking for or you have any questions, the Graduate Office will be happy to help.Cambridge is one of the top-ranked universities in the world. Study is intense and intellectually demanding and we place great emphasis on independent and self-directed learning. The University has its own academic conventions and expects you to take responsibility for your own learning.  Academic support is provided by your College and by the Faculty of History.The way we teach, the assessment methods used, and the emphasis on independent and self- directed learning may be very different to what you are used to. We hope that this handbook will help you understand what the course involves (e.g., course structure, progress through the first probationary year of the PhD, teaching approach, academic conventions, your first year assessment) and what is expected from you.As a student, you benefit from enviable access to some of the best library and museum collections in the world, as well as other specialist resources such as the language centre and IT facilities.The University provides strong support for your personal, professional, and career development and consequently provides information and opportunities to enhance and develop your skills to help you achieve your full potential.The University provides a great deal of information for students on living and studying in Cambridge and the pages for Cambridge students offer some tips that will hopefully make your time at Cambridge as stress-free as possible. These pages offer information about life in Cambridge, including the roles of your College, the Faculty and the University. Also, while it is hoped that your time at Cambridge will be an untroubled one, there may be occasions when you need additional  help and support, and so welfare and wellbeing support can also be found on these pages. The pages for International Students give details on life and study in Cambridge and may be of interest to all incoming students who are unfamiliar with Cambridge.http://www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/ http://www.internationalstudents.cam.ac.uk/studying Please find information from the Central University on Welfare and Wellbeing here.

They may wish to consult, for example, the style adopted by journals in the field of their submission, or the Chicago Manual of Style, 15th edition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), or the compact version thereof in Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, 7th ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007).This latitude for style choice has been introduced because academic styles vary widely among different journals and publishers, and it would be misleading to require students to adhere to a single system as if that were likely to be the only system required of them in the future. What students need to learn is to be consistent and clear in their use of any given style, and this is what the combination of compulsion and flexibility in this guide seeks to inculcate.It was ‘too close to call’.‘This is an example of such a grammatically complete sentence.’He said it. (But I don’t know why.)But contrast the case of brackets used within a full sentence:He said it (but I don’t know why).Numbers should be written out up to 100, except in a discussion that includes a mixture of numbers above and below this, in which case all of them should be in figures (e.g. 356 walkers overtook 72 others, as 6 fell back, exhausted). However, numbers with units should always be given in figures, with a space between the number and the unit (e.g. 4 cm).Dates should be written in the form: 20 December 1148; 20 December; AD 245-50. Centuries should be written out (twenty-first century) and 1920s etc. should be written without an apostrophe.ed., eds., edneditor, editors, editionf., ff.following page or pagesfol. and folsfolio, foliosMS and MSSmanuscript(s)QuQuotedr.Rectosig.signature numbertrans.translated (by)v.Versovol., vols.volume, volumesJohn Morrill, ‘Cromwell, Oliver (1599-1658)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765, accessed 15 June 2007].However, you should avoid citing websites where unnecessary, e.g. where a manuscript or source is readily available in print.1         Gordon Brown. Personal Interview. 25 December 2009.The interview should also be listed in the bibliography, where it may be suitable to provide more detail on the nature and circumstances of the interview (for example venue and duration).Where foreign language sources have been consulted, quotations should be given in the original language with a translation in the footnotes, or vice versa. If sources have been used in translation, the edition/translation consulted must be clear, and only the English version should be cited. For guidance on how this affects the word count, see A.4.e above. Please note that this guideline does not apply to foreign terms commonly used in English, e.g. ‘Ancien régime.’Use footnotes, not endnotes, for Faculty submissions (though note that most journals require text to be submitted as endnotes for eventual printing as footnotes). These footnotes should give a full form of the reference when first used, in whatever consistent style is adopted (see Section II for a recommended style). Do not use the author-date system – Skinner, 1969 – in either text or footnotes: although this system is used in some types of scholarly works, it is not well suited to most kinds of history and it is important for historians to learn to use a full reference footnoting system.a) keep footnotes as brief as possible, essentially for reference and not digressions. Example of an acceptable discursive footnote:See D.S. Allen, The World of Prometheus (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000), who however understates the extent to which the Athenians felt bound by their laws.Example of an unacceptable discursive footnote:Allen argues that the Athenians determined their own law, without professional judges, legislators, or bureaucrats, and that this led them to see the law as a tool to use in rhetorical argument rather than as a binding and independent constraint. However this understates the extent to which the Athenians felt bound by their laws. They referred to them as ‘the laws of Solon’ and appeal to the laws, or to their violation, was a trump card in political dispute.b)    Don’t over-footnote, but do make clear which reference goes with which item (don’t put five or six citations all in one footnote at the end of a paragraph, but key each to its relevant sentence). Where you have several references in a single footnote, separate items by a semi-colon. In most cases, the footnote indicator comes at the end of a sentencec)    Put a full stop at the end of every footnote.d)    In works divided into chapters, as most Part II dissertations are, the footnote numbering begins anew in each chapter.a)    Bibliographies should be divided into these sections, as applicable:b)    In all these sections, items are listed in alphabetical order. In the case of printed sources, this is done by the first or only author’s surname. In the case of works without an author, it is done by title, but these are in the same alphabetical listing.c)    Put a full stop at the end of every bibliographical entry.These style conventions are recommended only. This style has been adapted from the Cambridge University Press Humanities & Social Sciences Book Production Guide, drawing also at points on the Historical Journal notes for authors, with certain changes, additions and deletions to make it more practicable for undergraduates.The Cambridge University Press Guide for Humanities and Social Sciences athttps://authornet.cambridge.org/information/productionguide/hss/  is normally available online. If you choose to use this style, you may consult the Guide for additional information on minor points. You may alter the style for your own purposes so long as you are consistent (for example, medievalists and early modernists often omit the name of the publisher as this is either irrelevant or unknown for manuscripts and for early printed books). Alternatively, you may use any other consistent and documented style that you choose. At the risk of repetition, it must be stressed that the crucial issue is consistency within a single piece of work.The style convention for footnotes given here is to give a full reference at the first citation, and then author-plus-short-title in subsequent citations. The examples below use lower case in titles except for proper nouns; this should always be followed in the case of French and Latin titles, but in English and German titles either upper case or lower case may be used for non-trivial words in book titles.a)        First (or ‘full’) reference to books, articles, and manuscript source may be given as in the following examples (you may choose between giving authors’ names exactly as in their works, and using initials-plus-surname for all authors), giving where relevant the specific page number(s) to which you are referring:Books:Rosamond McKitterick, The Frankish kings and culture in the early middle ages (Aldershot: Variorum, 1995).A. T. Runnock, Medieval fortress building, new edn, 2 vols., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), vol. I, pp.135-7.[Here ‘pp.135-7’ are the specific pages to which reference is being made; there is alternatively a different convention, of dropping the ‘p.’ or ‘pp.’ when a volume number is cited, as it is here.]G. S. Rousseau and Pat Rogers (eds.), The enduring legacy: Alexander Pope, tercentenary essays (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 44.[Here ‘p.44’ is the specific page to which reference is being made. CUP style permits the ‘p.’ here, but its use is not mandatory, and you may choose to omit it so long as you do so consistently.]Chapter in edited volume:Charles Taylor, ‘The hermeneutics of conflict’, in Meaning and context: Quentin Skinner and his critics, ed. James Tully (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988), 218-28.[Here ‘218-28’ is the complete page range of the chapter.]Journal articles:Essays and Studies 11 (1958), 34-48.[Here ‘11’ is the volume number, which must be given, and ‘34-48’ is the complete page range of the article. As the Salter example shows, it is not necessary to give the journal issue number or month in addition to the volume. If you do decide to adopt a convention of giving either issue number or month (which must be done consistently), omit the other: so either Journal of American History 91:4 (2005), or Journal of American History91 (March 2005), but not Journal of American History 91:4 (March 2005).]Arthur Jerrold Tieje, ‘A peculiar phase of the theory of realism in pre-Richardsonian fiction’, PMLA 28 (1913), 213-52, at p.214.[Here PMLA would have to have been explained in an abbreviations list, otherwise spelt out here at first reference.]Manuscript material:Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh, 15 December 1748, ‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, Forster collection, XI, fol. 7, Harvard University.Unpublished theses or dissertations:H. R. Southall, ‘Regional unemployment patterns in Britain, 1851 to 1914’, unpublished PhD thesis, University of Cambridge (1984), p. 72.Films, sound recordings, music videos, television programmes:Use common sense to construct a consistent system of referencing. Include the date produced and for films, the country and director. Example: Kate Nickerson [Arnold Manoff nom de plume], writer, and Sidney Lumet, director, ‘The Death of Socrates: 399 B.C.’, episode of ‘You Are There’, CBS, national USA broadcast, 3 May 1953.b)  Short referenceAfter the first mention, references to the source in the notes should take a shortened form. A shortened reference includes only the last name of the author and an improvised short title for the book (containing the key word or words from the main title, so as to make the reference easily recognisable and not to be confused with any other work), followed by the page number of the reference. Thus:Books:Rousseau and Rogers (eds.), Enduring legacy, p. 45. Runnock, Medieval fortress building, p. 74.Articles:Salter, ‘Pilgrimage to truth’, pp.34-5. Tieje, ‘A peculiar phase’, p.75.Manuscript material:Southall, ‘Regional unemployment’, p. 72.‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, fol. 116.BN n.a.fr. 20628 (Thiers Papers), fol. 279.c)    MiscellaneousThe author may be separated from the short title, e.g. in footnote formulations such as:As Runnock observes, the fortress inevitably had a secondary religious function. Medieval fortress building, p. 134.You may choose to use ‘Ibid.’ [no italics] to refer to the work mentioned in the immediately preceding reference, so long as there is no danger of confusion.So:Runnock, Medieval fortress building, p.134. Ibid., p. 108.But not:Runnock, Medieval fortress building, p.134; ‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, fol. 116. Ibid., p.108.a)    A bibliography should generally contain all the sources cited in the text and notes and any other important titles that you have consulted or used in preparing the submission.b)    The form of entries in the bibliography is similar to that for the full reference, except that the author's surname and first name or initials are inverted. The bibliography does not give references to specific page numbers where information can be found, but rather lists pages only where they are the full page range of a journal article, book chapter, or other similar section of a larger whole.c)    Whatever style is adopted, items in a bibliography should have what is called a ‘hanging indent’, that is, the first line is flush with the left margin, but subsequent lines are indented three or four spaces. (This is as shown in the examples below.)d)    Examples for books and articles in bibliographyRunnock, A.T., Medieval fortress building, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976Salter, Elizabeth, ‘Piers Plowman and the pilgrimage to truth’, Essays and Studies 11 (1958), 30-48,Tieje, Arthur Jerrold, ‘A peculiar phase of the theory of realism in pre-Richardsonian fiction’, PMLA 28 (1913), 213-52e)    Archival and manuscript sources in bibliographyIn the case of primary manuscript sources, if few sources have been used, the alphabetical listing is by the name (surname or first word of organization) of the individual item and its manuscript collection, as follows. You will note that, with classical, medieval and early modern manuscripts, it is common for collections to be numbered as well as named, and (unlike modern sources) usual to list individual manuscripts, although not down to the level of the individual folios referenced.Examples:James Madison Papers.  Library of Congress, Washington, DC.National Fountain Pen Association Papers.  Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison, WI.Jemima O’Rourke Diary.  Alamance County Historical Society, Graham, NC.Rawlinson MS D. 36.   Papers on learning collected by Francis Turner.  Bodleian Library, Oxford.Donald Rumsfeld Papers.  Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, MAHowever, an alternative to the above convention is widely used by medieval historians: this is to give the alphabetical listing by the place, followed by the library, and then the shelf mark of the collection. Medievalists should follow this convention and others may choose to do so on the advice of their supervisor. Example:Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson MS D.36.  Papers on learning collected by Francis Turner. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

If you feel at any point you would like to pass on some feedback, please feel free to visit or contact the Graduate Office.The Faculty hope that most problems can be resolved quickly and efficiently by simple consultation or discussion with the right person – normally your Supervisor, College Tutor or the Directors of Graduate Studies and Graduate Training. They might be able to solve the problem directly, either by intervening or offering suitable advice about how to proceed or where to go for further assistance and advice.However, where this has failed to resolve the problem, students may seek advice from or submit an appeal or complaint to the Faculty’s Ombudsperson or to the central Student Complaints and Appeals Section.We hope that most problems can be resolved with your Supervisor, your College Tutors or the Faculty Directors, but where a problem cannot be resolved through these channels, the Faculty has appointed Ombudspersons to whom you can go to for advice.Ombudspersons are senior members of the Faculty whose task is to address any serious complaints about the academic quality or pedagogic efficiency of supervision made by research students. The role of the Ombudspersons is pastoral support and their actions are strictly confidential. Records of contacts between students and Ombudspersons will not appear in the student’s file. To note: Ombudspersons also take the role Faculty Harassment Advisers and will process complaints of this nature under rules issued by the central University: www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/policy/dignity/For the academic year 2017-2018, the Ombudspersons are:Dr Gabriela RamosDr Arthur AsserafDr Julia GuarnieriStudents should visit the following website for details on how to complain to the Student Complaints and Appeals Section.www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/academic/comp_app/index.htmlThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Part-time PhD students should follow the advice, processes and procedures described within this handbook for full-time PhD students.The key differences between full and part-time study are outlined below:• Timescale – the part-time PhD is typically completed over five years instead of three.• Residence Requirements – there are no residence requirements for Cambridge students however there are minimum attendance requirements. The part-time PhD is not a distance learning degree and students are expected to attend Cambridge regularly enough to be involved in academic life at Cambridge. The frequency of meetings will be at the discretion of you and your Supervisor.More information on part-time study can be found on our website:http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/prospective-graduates/courses/phd-fulltime/phd-fulltime-assessment It may be possible to change your mode of study from part-time to full-time or vice versa if your circumstances change and the other mode of study becomes more appropriate. Students should first discuss this change with their Supervisor.Once you have the support of your Supervisor, you will need to apply to change your mode of study on an application form which can be downloaded from your Self-Service pages. You will need to explain in your application why you wish to change mode and from what date. Your application will have to be approved by your supervisor, Faculty, College and the Board of Graduate Studies. You will also need to be interviewed by your department and the interviewing panel will include at least one person who will not be your supervisor.Changing your study mode is usually only permitted once in either direction.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Full information about how to do this can be found on the Cambridge Students web portal:www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/new-students/student-registrationEverything (well, most things academic) that you do while studying at Cambridge will be recorded in CamSIS. Enrolling for examinations, checking examination results, key contact information, athletic participation: all these things, and more, are logged on your CamSIS record.www.camsis.cam.ac.uk/cam-only/index.shtmlStudents can register as soon as their admission has been confirmed and will receive a Raven ID (also known as your crsid) which is used to access all University systems.All PhDs will be automatically enrolled to the PhD in History Moodle page. Here you can access documents and links which you will find useful for your course. You can log into Moodle via Raven here. The service, called DS-Remote, allows students remote access, via internet connection, to many software packages hosted on the University's Managed Cluster Service machines.UIS will be charging a fee of £5 per month for the DS-Remove service (one payment covers all the software).Please find out more information here. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The dates for the current year are below:In order to qualify for a Cambridge Degree, students are required to meet the below terms of residence:• Full-time students must ‘keep’ three terms in Cambridge; for a term to be 'kept,' a student has to reside in Cambridge for a minimum number of nights (60 for the Michaelmas and Lent Terms and 53 for the Easter Term). • All full-time graduate students are expected to live within the University’s precincts; that is, within the 10 mile radius of Great St Mary's church while carrying out research in the University. Students who have good reason to live further away must have the agreement of their supervisor that this will not impair their ability to study and to attend the University as required, and the consent of their College and the Faculty’s Degree Committee The exception to the above rules is that PhD students may apply for ‘Working Away from Cambridge' to undertake research relevant to their project. Please see here.Research students are expected to be in attendance and actively working on their research between terms, except during periods of holiday agreed with their supervisor, not normally exceeding 8 weeks in a 12-month period.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Cambridge offers unparalleled quality and breadth of historical research and expertise.The primary purpose of PhD study is the preparation and presentation of a substantial piece of original research, under the supervision of an academic member of the Faculty. From the very beginning of the PhD course the student focuses primarily on the writing of the doctoral dissertation, although instruction in specialist disciplines, such as palaeography, languages and computing, is provided for students who need it.The PhD course in Cambridge is taught principally by individual supervision. It has only a few specific course requirements; students are expected to undertake training in generic skills appropriate for historians and to attend research seminars and workshops throughout their studies and the Faculty has an active programme of events. You can find out about the Faculty Graduate Training here.The Faculty and the University also run a substantial amount of professional training in transferable skills, such as communication, self-awareness, and team-building, which is available for all PhD students as well as an expanding range of opportunities for teacher training in the later years of the PhD.The award of the degree, however, is decided principally on the results of the candidate’s research as presented in the PhD dissertation and on the candidate’s performance in the oral viva voce examination. Completion of the Cambridge PhD normally requires three to four years of full-time study, or at least five years of part-time study, including a probationary period in the first year. Terms of research are normally consecutive and, for full-time students, require residency in Cambridge.Minimum number of terms for which the UCF (University Composition Fee) must be paidMinimum number of terms of research that must be started before a thesis may be submitted Maximum number of terms of research that may be completed before a thesis must be submitted  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The PhD is administratively supported by the Graduate Office.Dr Renaud Morieux, Senior Lecturer in British History, Jesus CollegeRenaud Morieux is a social and cultural historian of Britain and France in the eighteenth century, with a focus on transnational exchanges. His work is concerned with sovereignty and territoriality in liminal zones, in Europe, Newfoundland, the Caribbean or Pondicherry.He is the editor of two books and the author of The Channel: England, France and the Construction of a Maritime Border in the Eighteenth Century (Cambridge University Press, 2016), which studies how the frontiers of Britain and France were conceptualized and lived by a variety of actors, diplomats and legal writers, cartographers and fishermen, smugglers and travellers.His next book, to be published by Oxford University Press, explores British and French concepts and experiences of war captivity in the long eighteenth century. He is also working on the history of international customary law. For a list of key publications please see the Faculty Website: www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/rm656@cam.ac.ukContact DetailsEmail: dgt@hist.cam.ac.uk Dr Pedro Ramos Pinto Lecturer in International Economic History, Trinity HallPedro Ramos Pinto is a Lecturer in International Economic History and a Fellow of Trinity Hall College, Cambridge. He joined the Faculty in 2013, after five years at the University of Manchester where he was Simon Research Fellow in History (2008 - 2010). He read History at Cambridge, where he also took his M.Phil (Economic and Social History) and PhD.His current research explores the creation, evolution, and implications of authoritarian welfare regimes in Southern Europe and Latin America. This has evolved from earlier work which explored the interaction between the Portuguese Dictatorship and its citizens to explain the emergence of social movements of the urban poor during the Carnation Revolution (1974 - 1976). This theme is explored in Pedro's book, Lisbon Rising: Urban Social Movements in the Portuguese Revolution, 1974-1975 (Manchester UP, 2013).Alongside this, Pedro is also interested in understanding how contemporary inequalities are shaped by the past, bringing a more long-term view to explain how and why societies distribute resources, opportunities, and capabilities.  As part of this, Pedro directs an international research network on the topic of Inequality and History.Pedro is an Associate Research Fellow of the Joint Centre for History & Economics, Harvard and Cambridge, as well as a Research Associate of the Institute of Contemporary History with the New University of Lisbon. He won the Mario Soares Foundation Prize in Contemporary History in 2008.For a complete list of publications and research projects, please visit http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-pedro-ramos-pintoContact Details Email: dgs@hist.cam.ac.ukThe Graduate Office is administered by two key contacts: Dave Mclaughlin, who looks after PhD students in their first probationary year, and Sheila Willson, who looks after students once they have completed their Registration Assessment Exercise and become registered PhD students at the end of the first year.Dave McLaughlinEmail: phd-firstyear@hist.cam.ac.uk Telephone: 01223 (3)35304Sheila Willson Email: degree-committee@hist.cam.ac.uk Telephone: 01223 (3)35305  It is important that the Faculty know your contact details so that we can contact you when necessary.

As there is a lot of paperwork involved after you have had the meeting, please aim to have your RAE meeting between you, your supervisor, and your advisor earlier rather than later. This is to ensure that you are registered before a) your fourth term begins and b) you undertake any period of working away over the summer, for example research trips. **All students who are admitted to the Cambridge PhD are admitted on a probationary basis. You are formally registered for the PhD only after a satisfactory progress assessment at the end of the probationary first year (five terms for part-time degrees). The assessment is designed also to focus your mind on the stages necessary for completion of your research within the normal time limit and to address any structural problems that have arisen during the first year. The progress examination/assessment at the end of year one is a substantial academic hurdle and continuation to the PhD is not automatic.The Registration Assessment Exercise in the Faculty of History consists of a written submission and a subsequent progress meeting with the Supervisor and the Advisor.The Advisor is chosen as a scholar in or close to the student's proposed field of research. The Graduate Office appoints your Advisor in consultation with your supervisor and we will then notify you. The Advisor’s primary duty is to advise the Degree Committee about registration.The Advisor as Advisor to the Student: The primary duty for the academic guidance of a research student remains with the Supervisor, who continues to be responsible for the student's progress after the Registration. The role of the Advisor is supplementary. Beyond the recommendations, if any, endorsed by the decision of the Degree Committee (such as change in the title and the scope of the dissertation), the academic views of the Advisor are not binding for the directing and conduct of the student's further research. Academic Contact between the Advisor and Student: Advisors are chosen as experts in the student's research area and it is expected that their academic advice will be sought by the students whom they assess both before and after the Registration Assessment. The Degree Committee does not wish to regulate such contacts in any formal manner. Students are positively encouraged by the Degree Committee to seek academic advice freely from all members of the Faculty and the University who might be of academic assistance to their work. This also applies to the seeking of the academic advice of their Advisor, provided that the academic contact between the student and the Advisor remains informal and subject to the general rule that Examiners (which Advisors are in a way) normally must not get involved with a student's work to a degree which might compromise their independence. Finally, the Advisor is often the best-suited person to act as internal examiner when the dissertation is submitted. However, if they have been reading chapter drafts in the year or two beforehand, they will likely be a conflict of interest and thus they will be unable to serve as an examiner. The Registration Assessment Exercise serves a serious educational purpose, which is to provide substantive advice and constructive criticism, in a formal setting, to students about their planned PhD project. For the Registration Assessment, each student is required to produce a substantial piece of written work. The Supervisor and Advisor then meet with the student to discuss the definition and feasibility of the research topic and scrutinise the wording of the title, the timetable and the methodology proposed.The Registration Assessment Exercise is an examination in that it is possible for a student not to be registered to proceed to a PhD (though it should be emphasised that this is a rare outcome). On rare occasions, the Advisor and the Supervisor may recommend to the Degree Committee that the student should not be registered for the PhD. Candidates who fail the Registration Assessment Exercise can qualify for other qualifications, such as the Certificate of Postgraduate Study, at the discretion of the Degree Committee.Where appropriate, the supervisor and Advisor should ascertain and report whether the first-year PhD student has attained a sufficient level of competence in English. Language difficulties may be grounds for not permitting a student to continue past the RAE.Advisors are urged by the Student Registry and the Degree Committee to have particular regard to the feasibility of the proposed research being completed within the normal time limit for submission: the project should be conceived as a three-year project, although the student has an absolute maximum of four years (twelve terms) to submit the dissertation. If an Advisor is unable to assure the Degree Committee that a student is likely to complete within these limits, then the submission of further material for a supplementary assessment at a later date in the same Term (or at some point during the Long Vacation) might be required; alternatively, the entire Registration Assessment Exercise might be repeated in the following Michaelmas Term.This usually consists of two pieces:This should be a substantial piece of written work of no less than 5,000 words (about 15 sides of well-filled A4 paper, typed double-spaced), though normally students produce longer piece of up to 10,000 words.The aims of the Progress Essay should be:• to introduce the general field of study and show familiarity with the existing historiography• to place the specific topic within this broader context, to explain its potential significance, to indicate how the research will contribute to knowledge and to explain why the student feels well placed to execute it• to list the available primary sources and to propose a strategy and feasible timetable for their use• to outline any planned period of work away from Cambridge• to provide a bibliography of at least fifty published secondary works in the proposed area of study• to record progress made so farStudents are permitted to present some preliminary findings in the form of an Appendix to the Progress Essay. If a student has completed enough research by this stage, it might take the form of a chapter or essay. Alternatively, it might, for example, take the form of an annotated list of documents or a preliminary statistical analysis which supplement the information in the Progress Essay. The appendix should not exceed 10,000 words in total.The Registration Assessment Exercise gives the student an opportunity, in consultation with the supervisor, to provide a provisional title for the dissertation. Here is some advice: ‘A title should be brief and to the point. It should not fall into two parts separated by a colon.' The title should approximate a simple statement of the subject or contents of the dissertation: do not use the interrogative form. It is advisable to include dates, or some other chronological indication, of the time period covered by the dissertation.’ The Degree Committee is vigilant in enforcing this convention.Once you have submitted your written progress essay you will meet with your Supervisor and Advisor to discuss your submission and your progress. Following this meeting, your Supervisor and Advisor will both submit a report  to the Graduate Office containing an evaluation of the student’s progress over the year and a reasoned judgment concerning registration. The reports of both the Supervisor and the Advisor are then reviewed and approved by a representative of the Subject Group in which the doctoral student’s work falls. The Degree Committee considers all reports before deciding on its own recommendation to the Student Registry, although in its deliberations the Committee is primarily guided by the judgement of the Advisor. The final decision is made by the Student Registry on the recommendation of the Degree Committee.Once you are registered, you can leave Cambridge to ‘work away’: please see here for further details.Students may wish to request adjustment(s) on grounds of disability for their oral examinations.  This could be for oral examinations for their first year assessments (or equivalent) or for their final viva voce examination.  Students should complete and return the additional voluntary disclosure form to their relevant Degree Committee. On receipt of a completed form, the Degree Committee should refer to the Disability Resource Centre who will advise on the appropriate course of action to be taken in each particular case.  Information should be provided to the examiners as advised by the DRC.Information contained on the form must be kept confidential and must not be used for any other purpose.Please see the following link for further information: www.student-registry.admin.cam.ac.uk/examinations-further-guidance-staff/degree-committees-and-departments/viva-voce-examinations The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Your supervisor will have expertise in your research area and will offer advice on all aspects of research and preparation of the thesis.Your Supervisor will be the main point of contact for academic support throughout your doctoral studies. At your college you will also have access to a College Graduate Tutor, who can advise on pastoral matters including financial matters and issues related to your welfare and accommodation in Cambridge.Students will meet their Supervisor regularly for one-on-one supervisions throughout the course. The style and frequency of meetings and supervision varies and will be arranged between Student and Supervisor.Students are encouraged to contact their supervisor either before term or as early as possible once term has started to arrange a first meeting.The first meeting provides an opportunity for inclusive, constructive exploration of the norms and conventions of Cambridge's academic culture, including expectations of students and supervisors, research and academic writing skills, facilities and support. In managing and clarifying expectations on both parts from the start, students and supervisors should agree:The Supervisor should ensure there are clear communications with the student:• make clear the frequency and timings of meetings• make sure that the student knows how to make contact at other times• some students will not, on the strength of their previous experience, expect to make the first approach to set up a meeting, but will expect their supervisor to take the initiative. It is advisable therefore to make firm appointments for students at least in the first instance and to be alert to the possibility of misunderstanding if the student does not make contact regularly• respond promptly and appropriately to requests from students to meetOnce your research topic has been established, your Supervisor should guide you in planning, focusing and developing your study by encouraging you to make a written timetable to ensure that a manageable piece of work is undertaken.Your Supervisor will read and comment on draft chapters. Most Supervisors will specify that they wish to see at least some draft chapters at an early stage, as they are written, so that the student has the opportunity to incorporate any feedback into subsequent writing. Supervisors should make sure criticism is honest, constructive and supportive.The most important qualification for becoming a graduate student is a sense of vocation. Your Supervisor will expect you to show a high level of self-motivation and determination throughout your doctoral studies.Your Supervisor also expects that if you are experiencing any difficulties, whether personal or academic, you will approach either them or your College Graduate Tutor. Your Supervisor is here to support you through your studies and will wish you success, so it is helpful to know as early as possible if additional support may be required.The University of Cambridge operates the Cambridge Graduate Supervision Reporting System or CGSRS, which allows graduate students to see their reports directly through their self-service web pages in CAMSIS (the University of Cambridge Student Information System): www.camsis.cam.ac.uk/public/gradss/Principal Supervisors should write a termly report, usually following a meeting with the student, enter it on CGSRS and discuss the report and your progress with you.Students are admitted to the PhD to work on their project with a named supervisor. If a student’s research topic changes substantially it may be necessary to try and find an alternative supervisor if possible. In some cases, a second supervisor may be assigned to a student to offer additional support in a particular research area.The Faculty hope that your working relationship with your Supervisor will be a successful one throughout your time at Cambridge, but in the unlikely event that a student experiences difficulties or a Supervisor is no longer available to supervise, the Director of Graduate Training and Degree Committee will discuss suitable alternatives and may allocate a new supervisor where necessary. However, there is no guarantee that you will be able to change Supervisors. If you wish to change topics to something that is outside your Supervisor’s expertise and/or is substantially different from the topic under which you were admitted to the PhD programme, the Degree Committee is unlikely to approve your new topic.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

A successful PhD dissertation must:The student's original contribution to knowledge is assessed in the light of what it is reasonable to expect a student to complete within three years (this applies to the scale of the project but not to its quality). The PhD is primarily designed to train graduate students as independent researchers so that on completion they can claim professional standing as university academic staff or in any other profession requiring skills in advanced research. Many students publish parts of their research after the award of their PhD or en route to it.Further details can be located on the Student Registry websiteThe Student Registry webpage, preparing to submit, provides information on:The PhD Examination process is divided into three stages:See PhD Examination - stage one - appointment of examiners for more details.See PhD Examination - stage two - preparation and submission of thesis for more detailsSee PhD Examination - stage three - the viva voce examination for more details  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

One of the Examiners is always from outside the University (the 'External' Examiner); the other is customarily a member of the University of Cambridge (the 'Internal' Examiner). The research subject is provisionally approved at the point of admission to the degree and confirmed more specifically when you are formally registered for a research degree. When you apply for Examiners to be appointed, the Degree Committee asks for a precise dissertation title to be proposed for their approval. The supervisor may also be invited to indicate his or her support for this title.    In the History Faculty specifically, at least 4 months, and ideally 6 months, before submitting the thesis, please complete the Faculty Appointment of Examiners form and email it to the Degree Committee Office along with:- a 1-2 page summary of the thesis, -  any viva requests (see the appointment of examiners form)Please see Student Registry note here regarding summaries and dissertation titles.To note:  it is entirely at the discretion of the examiners whether viva requests can, or cannot, be met.  There may be valid reasons why examiners cannot accommodate such requests and candidates should respect this decision if it is made.It is a good idea to review the Submission of thesis checklist at this point.If students require examination access arrangements, it would be best to begin such considerations.Students are advised to start reviewing "PhD Examination - stage two - preparation and submission of thesis" Your Supervisor will be contacted by the Degree Committee Office to provide examiner suggestions for Degree Committee approval.   To note, Degree Committee can overturn or amend supervisor suggestions where it deems it necessary.After Degree Committee have made their decisions, potential examiners will be invited to act and the student is also contacted at this point.If examiners decline to act, Degree Committee approval of further examiner options received from the supervisor may be required, hence the desire for this process to begin at least 4-6 months before submission.Students are informed of their examiners' names when they submit the thesis for examination.Please proceed to stage two: preparation and submission of thesis  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Though the central objective of the Faculty of History’s graduate courses is to provide students with the opportunity to engage in a serious piece of research and writing, the courses also offer training in a wide range of skills. Some of these skills are highly specialized and relate to specific kinds of academic research, but many are part of the wider training required to perform well in academic and research posts, and many are transferable skills of use in many kinds of non-academic employment.These pages give the details of the Faculty’s graduate training programme. Current students can access the Graduate Training Booklet on their relevant Moodle pages (which gives specific details of sessions) and please also consult the Graduate Training calendar. We have also suggested other areas within the University to explore as there is a lot of training on offer and not just with the Faculty!If you have a query about the training offered by the Faculty, please contact Dave McLaughlin on gradtraining@hist.cam.ac.uk; if your query is for other training, please contact the relevant organisation.We are happy to receive suggestions and constructive criticisms either directly to the Directors of Graduate Training and Graduate Studies or through the Graduate Representative. We run an annual Graduate Training Survey and really welcome your responses!Some sessions require students to sign-up for them (because places are limited). Students are urged to sign-up for sessions early as these sessions operate on a first come, first served basis. How do I know which sessions I can/should attend?We have included a suggestion of 'who can attend' for each event within the Faculty-provided training within these pages. If you are not listed in the eligibility section then you can always ask whoever is running the session to see if they are happy for you to attend. For training with other providers, please check with the relevant organisation to see if you are eligible. Doctoral students, in consultation with their supervisors, should review their training needs at the start of each academic year. They should use the Training Log to record their training development.Post-doctoral researchers are entitled to participate in the training options and should sign up as instructed in each option.You should look out for additional opportunities which may arise during the year and will be announced here.

It is interested in, of course, exploring large-scale changes provoked by technological advancement: how new methods of archiving, data manipulation, social media, crowdsourcing, mapping and so forth are producing new ways of making history, new ways of communicating research to scholarly and public audiences, and new methodological problems for the historical profession. But we also construe "technology" in the broadest sense: from virtual databases to physical index cards; from Kindles to books; from python to provenience, from Mellel to Moleskines; from cameras to pencils; from digital archives to the manuscript that crumbles in our hands. Thus this seminar is also a space for encouraging graduate students to rethink what historians do and how we do it. Digital technologies do not only open new archives, perspectives and methodological pathways, but also invite us to revisit the lasting significance of traditional methods and practices in historical scholarship. How do you organise your research notes? How best to keep track of voluminous reading lists and new scholarship? How do we manage book collections in this hybrid age of ink and E-ink? How and where do you write? With what tools do you approach the archive? How should we think about archival serendipity in the age of Search? The Digital History Seminar is a unique conversational space for graduates to come together to explore these developments, which are slowly but surely reshaping the discipline. For questions, suggestions and anything else, please contact the convener, Dr Leigh Denault (ltd22@cam.ac.uk)Michaelmas term seminar details can be found here  Course leader: Max Satchell, CAMPOP, Department of Geography & Faculty of HistoryDemonstrator: Ellen Potter, CAMPOP, Department of GeographyWant to make great looking maps but don’t know where to start?

GIS is now something anyone with basic computing skills can do.As members of the University you have free access to state of the art GIS software the annual license fee of which is £50 K for individuals in the private sector. Take advantage of it! The GIS for Historians course is a practical introduction to working with GIS software. The emphasis is very much on learning by doing in a supported environment with plenty of help on hand . Students are also encouraged to ask questions about GIS as it pertains to their own research. Topics covered include basic GIS and mapping, sourcing digital historical GIS data, creating GIS datasets from written sources, digitizing from historical maps, simple and more complex GIS analyses, 3d GIS and cartograms.The course is available to Masters and PhD students of the Faculty of History.For information of when sessions are held, please check the Graduate Training calendar for sessions under 'GIS for Historians'. These two seminars aim to introduce graduate historians to the practices of planning, constructing and analysing oral histories. Each seminar will examine several of the methodological or theoretical debates within this field, and will be supplemented by discussion of a specific case study. The seminars will be discussion-based and informal, intended to support students in undertaking their own oral history-based research or reusing existing oral histories. Participants will be expected to complete the reading for each class and be prepared to participate fully, which will include discussing their own research. Themes will includeNumbers will be capped if necessary. Students may sign up by emailing Dr Lucy Delap  (lmd11@cam.ac.uk)There will be two sessions of 1 hour 30 minutes each to take place in Lent Term. For information of when sessions are held, please check the Graduate Training calendar for sessions under 'Theory and Practice in Oral History'. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open. For full information for applicants please see the Research funding webpage.  Film show: To Sir with Love (1967)

Attendance is compulsory for all probationary PhD students (NOTAFs). The 2017 dates for the Presentation Days are:15th February, 2pm - 5pm22nd February, 2pm - 5pmAt the Presentation Days, each NOTAF student presents a 15-minute paper to a group of peers and a moderator who is a member of the History Faculty.  Each presentation is followed by about 15 minutes of questions, comments and discussion.  The Presentation Days are designed to give students experience of presenting academic work, and to engage with and offer feedback on the work of others. These days offer students a chance to develop their ideas in a supportive environment of their peers. Graduate student are invited to present some aspect of their doctoral research, striking a balance between general ideas and specific evidence.  Students might focus on methodological or theoretical issues that will need to be addressed during the course of doctoral research:  feel free to raise questions rather than provide definitive answers.  Or instead they might use a specific example (or examples) to illustrate a significant aspect of the doctoral topic or to explore a particular problem of method or approach.  Here are some of the presentation topics from past Presentation Days:Presenters are under no obligation to illustrate the presentation with paper handouts, overhead projections or PowerPoint. However students are welcome to use such aids if they will enhance the audience’s ability to follow and appreciate the presentation or if you wish to gain some experience in using them.  Both content and style are important.  The audience may ask questions or comment on both the content and style of the presentation. The particular advantage of the Presentation Days is that it provides an opportunity for a frank yet supportive discussion of presentation skills at a very early point in a young academic’s career.Yes, but learning to adapt a presentation to a set time is a useful skill for your academic career. Applicants to academic positions in the Faculty of History at Cambridge are asked to encapsulate their entire academic career – past, present and future – in a talk of just 15 minutes, and historians are often asked by Melvyn Bragg or Andrew Marr to tell what is important about the Black Death, ‘common-sense philosophy’ or the Crimean war in a minute! The presentation is not designed to be a test or everything you know about your subject, but rather a chance to practice selecting ideas and evidence and organising them in a lucid and engaging way. For Presentation Days, all NOTAF PhD students are divided into groups of about ten:  there are usually five or six groups each year.  The groups convene concurrently on both days.  Within each group, half the group presents its work on the first Presentation Day, and the other half presents its work on the second Presentation Day. Therefore, it is essential that all participants attend the entirety of both Presentation Days. Each group will comprise students working on a variety of different periods, places and problems in order to create the potential for fruitful discussion.  Presenters should not assume that the historical significance of their research will be immediately obvious to the others in the group and it may be that a brief explanation of where the research topic fits within a wider historical field, and what its special significance is, is more likely to engage the interest of the group than a paper that focuses too heavily upon the details of the topic.  This is a skill that will be valuable throughout your academic or professional career.After each paper, the group will be invited, for about 15 minutes, to ask questions. This gives students chance to benefit from discussion, feedback, and exchanges among graduate students and senior members of the Faculty. The spirit of the Presentation Days is constructive observation; unconstructive or combative criticism is out of place. For this reason all students are required to stay for the whole of both afternoons. The moderator is an experienced member of the History Faculty.  Where possible, the same Faculty member will moderate both sessions for a given group.  The moderator will keep time and alert speakers if they go beyond the 15-minute limit, plus they will lead the feedback on the basis of their own extensive experience.  However, all members of the group are encouraged to ask questions and to give feedback.   There is a break for tea in the middle of each Training Day, and there is a drinks party at the conclusion of each day. Students in the past have found the Presentation Days to be enjoyable and not intimidating, and we do hope this will be your experience.  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Though the central objective of the Faculty of History’s graduate courses is to provide students with the opportunity to engage in a serious piece of research and writing, the courses also offer training in a wide range of skills. Some of these skills are highly specialized and relate to specific kinds of academic research, but many are part of the wider training required to perform well in academic and research posts, and many are transferable skills of use in many kinds of non-academic employment.These pages give the details of the Faculty’s graduate training programme. Current students can access the Graduate Training Booklet on their relevant Moodle pages (which gives specific details of sessions) and please also consult the Graduate Training calendar. We have also suggested other areas within the University to explore as there is a lot of training on offer and not just with the Faculty!If you have a query about the training offered by the Faculty, please contact Dave McLaughlin on gradtraining@hist.cam.ac.uk; if your query is for other training, please contact the relevant organisation.We are happy to receive suggestions and constructive criticisms either directly to the Directors of Graduate Training and Graduate Studies or through the Graduate Representative. We run an annual Graduate Training Survey and really welcome your responses!Some sessions require students to sign-up for them (because places are limited). Students are urged to sign-up for sessions early as these sessions operate on a first come, first served basis. How do I know which sessions I can/should attend?We have included a suggestion of 'who can attend' for each event within the Faculty-provided training within these pages. If you are not listed in the eligibility section then you can always ask whoever is running the session to see if they are happy for you to attend. For training with other providers, please check with the relevant organisation to see if you are eligible. Doctoral students, in consultation with their supervisors, should review their training needs at the start of each academic year. They should use the Training Log to record their training development.Post-doctoral researchers are entitled to participate in the training options and should sign up as instructed in each option.You should look out for additional opportunities which may arise during the year and will be announced here.

You can also use the Graduate Training calendar to see when sessions are scheduled. Aimed at new PhD students, known as NOTAFs (Not at First Registered). There will be an after-party following this event where you can meet the Graduate Office staff as well as your fellow PhD candidates. This is aimed at new graduate members of the Faculty (NOTAF and MPhil) to help understand some of the services on offer within the University. These include, but are not limited to, the Faculty Computer Office, the Seeley Library, the Careers Service, the Language Centre, University-wide Training, and your Graduate Representative. Meet your Graduate Representative and find out about the student-initiated workshops available within the Faculty. Workshops are an excellent way to test out ideas among peers in a research-friendly environment. We will be staggering this event for MPhils in one slot followed by NOTAFs in a later slot. An informal question-and-answer session for graduate students who are new to Cambridge. Come to hear the Head of Humanities and Social Sciences Libraries and Seeley Librarian talk about the Seeley Library as well as what is offered with the University Library. The Seeley is part of the UL and so this is an introduction to finding secondary, and some primary, historical sources, as well as historical sources online. As well as what is offered through the University Library, there are some specific collections available within Cambridge with the colleges. Come to hear representatives give a brief introduction to what their respective collections contain and get contact details for if these may be useful in your research area. As well as the central AHRC induction event, AHRC awardholders should attend in order to find out about communications newsletters, JeS accounts, additional awards, training and transferable skills requirements, the international placement scheme, submission rates, and much more. A welcome session for the all the NOTAFs who joined in Lent or Easter and consequently missed the earlier Welcome sessions. All doctoral students should download a Personal Training Plan and Training Log. You can find these documents on your relevant Moodle pages. Following the initial meeting with your supervisor when you discuss appropriate training and skills, you can then retain and complete your log and plan. For probationary PhD students, your supervisor will upload your log and attendance along with their supervision report on your registration meeting. Other PhDs may wish to ask their supervisors to include their log within their termly supervision reports. This allows you to track your training progress and discuss with your supervisor what else you need to continue improving. You can include courses, lectures, seminars, workshops, and any other training you have received as you progress through your course.

Undergraduates would greatly benefit from your enthusiasm for the subject and state-of-the-art insight into scholarly practice. We therefore run a programme of graduate-led classes for third-year undergraduate historians. We hope leading a class would appeal to many of you. So doing would provide you with experience of small-group teaching. Leading classes is an important aspect of being a lecturer, especially in other universities. Cambridge’s supervision model provides few opportunities for practising teaching small groups: these classes provide one such opportunity. We regret that we cannot pay graduates who take part. We greatly value your participation, however, and try to make it as beneficial as possible (for instance, through helping to collate feedback that could be used in a job application). If you are interested, then please read on.First, what is HAP?HAP is examined in in the third year of the undergraduate degree. It is intended to be a consummation of the undergraduate’s study, challenging her/him to draw on her/his entire knowledge of the past. The paper encourages students to reflect on broad issues of historical understanding and practice arising out of their work over all three years of the undergraduate degree. The paper is a means of enabling candidates to raise and discuss fundamental questions and relate their knowledge of specialized fields to more general themes of historical inquiry and explanation.HAP is not a theory paper.  Conceptual and theoretical thinking is important for doing well on the paper. But the paper is not an invitation to rehearse theory!  Rather, it is an opportunity for undergraduates to develop general concepts and arguments in relation to historical evidence gained through studying different periods and times.Nor is HAP is a historiography paper.  A historiographical perspective is very helpful in writing a good HAP essay, but the historiographical perspective has to be developed in conjunction with the exploration of a range of historical evidence.HAP asks undergraduates to adopt a panoramic conceptual perspective under which they organize historical material from a range of papers.  A good HAP essay will have a conceptual unity, deploying historical evidence from different periods and places and possibly from different historical sub-disciplines.Second, how does the Faculty teach HAP?In Michaelmas and Lent terms, the Faculty runs a lecture programme, consisting of two strands:The graduate-led classes are connected to the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lecture series. We aim to offer undergraduates the option of attending a class on each of the sixteen topics.The lecture programme (with further information about HAP) is available at: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/tripos-papers/historical-argument-and-practice   Third, how do graduate-led HAP classes fit into HAP teaching?The graduate-led classes are different in nature from the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lectures.  The classes allow a small-group, participatory and interactive learning setting to complement the provision of the lecture programme.  It is important to note that the graduate-led class is a class:  it is not an additional lecture on the topic.  The graduate-student teacher’s task is to stimulate, animate and lead a discussion.  To allow for an interactive class, classes are capped, flexibly, at about 20 undergraduates.Graduate-led HAP classes are held in Lent term. They follow the order of the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lecture series.  This sequencing allows you and the undergraduates to attend the relevant lecture and do some thinking and reading before the class. Undergraduates are required to sign up for classes in advance. This requirement allows the graduate teacher to contact the undergraduates in advance and propose reading or questions or other teaching-related matters.One important thing to note is that HAP teaching is done from the standpoint of the generalist. Anyone teaching HAP within the Faculty has to think beyond the boundaries of her/his specialism. Your class will contain undergraduates who have taken very different combinations of paper, because – as noted already – HAP is the only compulsory paper. So lectures and classes need to find ways of engaging people whose primary interest might be far from your own (whether medieval Europe, modern Britain, the extra-European world, or so on).Finally, how do you get involved?The HAP Convenor will call for applications to lead an HAP class in September.  This is your chance to express an interest.  If at all possible, you ought to attend a short training session with the HAP Convenor. This training session will be held on Wednesday 15 November in the History Faculty (details on the training calendar).Questions about graduate-led HAP classes can be directed either to the Ph.D. administrator (gradtraining@hist.cam.ac.uk) or to the HAP convenor Dr Rachel Leow (rl341@cam.ac.uk).  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

These are predominantly for those conducting research within the particular area of the subject group, however please do email and ask if there is anything you see which may be of interest to attend. This reading group will meet 7 times in the year, meeting by videoconference with students and staff at Columbia and New York Universities. This is part of the New York - Cambridge Training Collaboration in 20th-Century British History. More details on this can be found here. It is designed for PhD students in modern British history and related fields who want to have the opportunity to lift their head up from their specialist research and consider the shape of the whole field, with a view to their future as teachers and colleagues.  Emphasis is placed on the widest possible perspectives and on in-depth discussion.  It is therefore meant to complement the research seminars where scholars present their own work. Classes will be organised around the discussion of recent important texts in modern British history.  Discussion will be introduced by formal presentations by seminar participants, which will put the selected texts into their wider historiographical context, thus giving a sense not only of where the field is today but where it has come from. The seven sessions will range across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and will engage with a wide range of sub-disciplines, including economic, political, cultural, imperial and social history.All PhD students are warmly invited to attend.  The only condition placed on attendance is that participants must engage to attend the entire series and to have read the works for discussion in advance.  If you are interested in participating, please contact Professor Peter Mandler at the beginning of Michaelmas Term, as early as possible. Convenors: Jon Lawrence (jml55@cam.ac.uk), Lucy Delap (lmd11@cam.ac.uk), Peter Mandler (pm297@cam.ac.uk)  This seminar examines a range of important contributions to the history of political thought from the nineteenth century to the present, in order to explore some of the ways authors have made use of diverse and innovative approaches, methods, and perspectives in their efforts to produce interesting and important work. Instead of rehearsing familiar debates over methods, we will consider historical examples of how different approaches have been put to use, what sorts of histories of political thought they made it possible to write, and the intellectual and political stakes involved in choosing to write one of these sorts of history instead of another. Among the seminar's aims is to invite students to rethink the place of both 'Cambridge School' and other approaches as part of a longer and ongoing tradition of historical thinking about theories of politics. Other authors read include Meinecke, Koselleck, and Foucault. The seminar is intended for PhD students in History and Politics. To join the course, please contact one of the Convenors: Chris Meckstroth (History) (cm753@cam.ac.uk) and Chris Brooke (POLIS) (cb632@cam.ac.uk)  The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

HAP stands for Historical Argument and Practice. HAP is the paper taken by all history undergraduates, and is examined in the first and third years. These classes are taken by third-year undergraduates. This session will be given by the Faculty's HAP convenor. It has two objectives: first, to explain what HAP entails; second, to discuss small-group teaching. The session will explain the purpose of HAP, the way it is taught, and how it is assessed; it will also address undergraduate perspectives on HAP. The session will then raise practical issues about teaching classes, which may not be encountered when giving supervisions. It will share suggestions based on experience and also invite graduate contributions. The session will include opportunities for asking questions about HAP and about class-teaching.  A session run by the Graduate Representative in the History Faculty where you can hear the experience of postgraduates in terms of how they approached the writing up stage of their research. This is an informal session where you will be encouraged to ask questions; it is also an advisory session rather than prescriptive, so even if you already know how you work it will be useful to hear advice from others in case it confirms what you already think or urges you to consider a different technique.Lunch, tea/coffee and cake will be provided. Publication is of course the essential step towards academic fame and fortune, or at least, employment. A first publication is probably the most difficult, and also may be for you the most urgent. Publication in a respected refereed journal is probably the quickest and most direct way of making your mark as a significant scholar. Yet journals vary greatly in their range, prestige, readership, standards and waiting time. This session aims to give you some basic information about publishing a major article, and also to suggest some ways of choosing the right journal to approach and tailoring your work appropriately. It also points out some other ways of getting academically into print. As graduate students many of you will be thinking about publications. One aim of this session is to explain the processes of refereeing in scholarly journals, in order to help you think about preparing some of your own work for publication in article form. Many young scholars are also interested in writing reviews. This session will also discuss the importance of reviewing, and what makes a good review article.  The section on Fellowships and Academic Posts will consider: applications for Oxbridge junior research fellowships, ESRC, AHRC and the various IHR fellowships; the rather different things that the various bodies are looking for; how to pitch a successful application; how to avoid the common pitfalls and how to avoid squandering your research fellowship if you get one. The seminar will be focused on practical issues concerned with maximising your chances of success.The section on grants will consider: who is and is not eligible to apply to each body; how to get round not being eligible; how to cost applications; how to pitch applications to maximise your chance of success; how to avoid being crucified if you succeed in getting a grant (by promising too much). The seminar will be focused on practical issues concerned with maximising your chances of success without paying too high a price. Michael Watson will describe the changing global context of academic publication in today's digital environment, and give some specific practical guidelines for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as they contemplate book publication for the first time. Michael has many years of publishing experience at Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press and is responsible for the Press's global History publishing programme. This session is designed to introduce graduate students to undergraduate supervisions. We will explain what supervisions are, how they function, and how graduate students can gain teaching experience by giving them.

Some are thematic, some are period-based; all bring together MPhil and graduate students to discuss and present their work in a supportive peer environment. Many workshops also pursue projects such as conference panels and colloquia, and most become friend groups. Some offer sandwiches, some insist on wine. All provide a lively environment to meet other historians working on topics which are at least marginally related.We have three thematic workshops which run on a yearly basis. Each year, there are three places for thematic workshops for which graduate students can apply (including the current thematic workshops, which only run for a year at a time). The call for workshop Proposals usually opens in early Lent - more details will be provided soon. Please contact the Grad Rep for any more information, and we look forward to reading your workshop proposals.Grad Rep: gradrep@hist.cam.ac.uk Meet the WorkshopsSession Leader: all the convenors of the Graduate Workshops, Grad Rep Meet the Grad Rep and find out about the workshops available within the Faculty. Workshops are an excellent way to test out ideas among peers in a research-friendly environment.  The workshops are a great place to fine-tune a paper for a conference presentation, and to test ideas. Neither presentation nor even participation are mandatory, but any PhD student who fails to get involved in at least one workshop is really missing out on a useful, exciting, and fun part of the faculty's grad programme.All workshop programmes are available on the Graduate Training Google calendar. Workshop organisation is another great experience - and good for the CV. Sign up for the mailing lists that each workshop runs by emailing the workshop convenor or visiting the 'Meet the Workshops' session at the beginning of the year. If you have a personal Google account you can also tell the calendar to text or email you when workshop events are about to happen.

We encourage submissions from Masters and PhD students, as well as early career researchers, working on gender and sexuality (broadly defined) from any time period.Although gender and sexuality are the overriding themes of the workshop, we welcome submissions that consider how these themes can be applied to a broader range of historical events, periods, mentalités, people or processes. Most of those who attend the workshop regularly do not necessarily consider themselves gender scholars, but have nevertheless welcomed the opportunity that the workshop provides to consider the historical role that gender can play in even the seemingly unlikeliest of situations. The workshop provides an opportunity to present finished or work-in-progress research to a friendly and supportive audience of your peers. Papers are likely to be 20-30 minutes in length, but we welcome submissions for longer formats or shorter paired papers for panel discussion. The format and length are flexible and the paper can be given in the manner that best suits the presenter’s material with discussion to follow.We meet fortnightly in term at Clare College, on Wednesdays, for an hour from 13:00. A light lunch will be provided.Fred E. Smith (fes40)Owen Brittan (ob293)Katarzyna Brzezinska (kwb21@cam.ac.uk)George J. Severs (gjs53@cam.ac.uk)11th October - Asiya Islam and Owen BrittanThe New Woman: 150 Years of British and Indian Women's MagazinesUntil very recently you could easily make the case that magazines and newspapers were the most popular form of media dating back to the seventeenth century. While women’s magazines have commonly been dismissed as trivial on the basis that they are all about fashion, relationships, and domesticity, they offer a rich area for inquiry. The editors and owners of these publications wielded enormous normative power to both reflect upon and shape culture. Women’s magazines not only provided a forum for women to develop a sense of shared experiences but have also been at times instrumental in feminist movements.  In both India and the UK, women’s magazines have long and complex histories that reflect the changing attitudes of the day. This talk will trace the changing portrayal of women in print throughout the last 150 years and examine how historical events in both countries influenced these portrayals, where they diverged, and where they converged within an increasingly globalised society. 18th October - Dr Naomi PullinFaithless Friends: Women's Sociability and Conflict in the Long-Seventeenth CenturyIn his popular treatise De amicitia, Cicero noted that ‘Some men are better served by their bitter-tongued enemies than by their sweet-smiling friends’. But even today the question of who constitutes an enemy or a friend remains unresolved.  Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Britain has been characterised an age of 'sociability' and 'politeness', with the growth of spaces for sociable interaction such as the tea table, coffee house, salon, and new reading and writing practices. Much scholarly attention has recently been devoted to the friendly exchanges that took place between women during this moment of social and cultural transformation. However, few have acknowledged the tensions inherit in these relationships, or the ways in which an emerging culture of civility and politeness enhanced discussions about enmity and hostility. This paper seeks to question whether there was a specifically gendered dimension to female antagonism at this time by probing both the theory and practice of friendship in Britain in the long-seventeenth century. Using evidence drawn from published treatises, as well as the diaries and letters penned by women, it aims to present some preliminary ideas about the activities, conditions and behaviours that could at once 'make' and 'break' female intimacies. 25th October - Susanne SchmidtRethinking the double standard: Feminist constructions of aging in twentieth-century AmericaMiddle age is often associated with a “double standard” (Susan Sontag) according to which maturity is good for men, who reach their “prime of life,” but bad for women, whose aging is pathologized. But consider the understanding of midlife as the moment of a woman’s reinvention. The case of the “midlife crisis” offers a good example of this idea: it became popular with the American journalist Gail Sheehy’s best-selling Passages (1976) as a concept which described the onset of middle age as the moment when a woman would re-enter the world of work (while men often dropped out). In this talk, I study positive and critical concepts of midlife change, put forward in political treatises, social scientific and medical studies, best-selling books and self-help literature, and ask in what ways did women (and some men) use middle age for feminist purposes? Paying attention to “feminist voices” (Alexandra Rutherford) changes our understanding of the double standard about middle age. I show that feminist critique and empowering concepts of aging were integral to public debates about gender and the life course. Women drew on “prime of life” imagery, just like men, to describe middle life as the end of problems of motherhood and the beginning of liberation into public and professional lives and careers. Celebrations of aging sometimes explicitly opposed the double standard, yet they were more than defensive critiques: constructions of midlife liberation formed a stable system of thought in its own right, throughout the twentieth century, eliciting response and backlash, which attested to their currency and influence. 22nd November - Georgia OmanWomen’s higher education and the gendering of physical space in nineteenth-century CambridgeIn this paper, I will explore how gender was encoded in the physical space of the University of Cambridge in the late-nineteenth century, shaping how male and female students interacted with both the built environment and each other. As much as universities were sites of knowledge production and transmission, they were also geographical locations that both male and female students had to traverse and negotiate on a day-to-day basis. I will argue that coeducation in practice consisted of both segregation and integration defined by relation to physical space, while the gender divide it brought about was manifested architecturally, through the design and modification of shared and separate spaces.© 2017 University of Cambridge

As with previous years, these presentation seminars serve a multifold purpose.Doctoral students can present the results of current research, while MPhil students might want to use the opportunity to receive some feedback on preparatory work for their final dissertation or essays.An inter-disciplinary approachThe research outlook of the workshop is deeply inter-disciplinary. We welcome papers on intellectual history, global intellectual history, contemporary political philosophy, critical theory, cultural history, and beyond. Even if your research interests might, at first sight, only have a tangential affinity with the field of intellectual history: don’t hesitate to submit your abstract, including a short academic CV, to publicize further research during these sessions.Michaelmas TermTuesdays, 5 PM, Room 5, History Faculty10 OctoberEloise Davies (Cambridge)From caritas to libertas: The Religious Legitimisation of Florentine Republicanism in the Age of Salutati and Bruni24 OctoberBoyd van Dijk (EUI/KCL)Inventing Civilian Protection in War:  A Critical History of the Geneva Conventions of 19497 NovemberAnya Ciccone (Cambridge)Politics and Education in Restoration Naples, 1821-184821 NovemberMerve Fejzula (Cambridge)Cold War Cultural Pan-Africanism and the Contested Terrain of Black 'Culture'5 DecemberGautham Shiralagi (Oxford)Towards an Aesthetic History of the Political: Reflections from 20th-century IndiaConvenorsMimi Howard (mmh53)Barret Reiter (bpr24) Image: Ambrogio Lorenzetti, The Allegory of Good and Bad Government (detail), fresco, c. 1339© 2017 University of Cambridge

Some are thematic, some are period-based; all bring together MPhil and graduate students to discuss and present their work in a supportive peer environment. Many workshops also pursue projects such as conference panels and colloquia, and most become friend groups. Some offer sandwiches, some insist on wine. All provide a lively environment to meet other historians working on topics which are at least marginally related.We have three thematic workshops which run on a yearly basis. Each year, there are three places for thematic workshops for which graduate students can apply (including the current thematic workshops, which only run for a year at a time). The call for workshop Proposals usually opens in early Lent - more details will be provided soon. Please contact the Grad Rep for any more information, and we look forward to reading your workshop proposals.Grad Rep: gradrep@hist.cam.ac.uk Meet the WorkshopsSession Leader: all the convenors of the Graduate Workshops, Grad Rep Meet the Grad Rep and find out about the workshops available within the Faculty. Workshops are an excellent way to test out ideas among peers in a research-friendly environment.  The workshops are a great place to fine-tune a paper for a conference presentation, and to test ideas. Neither presentation nor even participation are mandatory, but any PhD student who fails to get involved in at least one workshop is really missing out on a useful, exciting, and fun part of the faculty's grad programme.All workshop programmes are available on the Graduate Training Google calendar. Workshop organisation is another great experience - and good for the CV. Sign up for the mailing lists that each workshop runs by emailing the workshop convenor or visiting the 'Meet the Workshops' session at the beginning of the year. If you have a personal Google account you can also tell the calendar to text or email you when workshop events are about to happen. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open. For full information for applicants please see the Research funding webpage.  Film show: To Sir with Love (1967)

While the workshop continues to maintain a focus on histories of European expansion and imperialism, papers also engage with comparative approaches to world history, including topics such as migration and trade networks, science and technology, and colonial and post-colonial law.The World History Workshop provides an informal and relaxed setting in which to test out ideas, and to practice giving conference papers among fellow graduate students. We feature submissions at every stage of research, and papers from both MPhil and PhD students. If you are interested in presenting, or have any inquiries, please contact one of the conveners listed below. Seminars take place on Wednesdays between 17.30 and 19.00 in the Junior Parlour, Gonville and Caius College except where otherwise noted.Laura Channing (lc679)Annalise Higgins (arh86)Louise Moschetta (lpgm2)Ayse Polat (hap41)Tom Smith (tds33)Chris Wilson (cw498). 11 OctoberWelcome drinks - 19.30 at the Pint Shop 18 OctoberLachlan Fleetwood (Clare)Altitude sickness, intermediaries, and instrumentalised bodies in the exploration of the Himalaya, 1800-1850 1 NovemberUsing Archives Overseas Roundtable 8 November      12.30-1.30pm, Room 10, Faculty of HistoryLuna Sabastian (Clare Hall) ‘Not a sin but a bounden duty of every Hindu youth’: miscegenous intimacy and the destruction of Hinduism in ‘Veer’ Savarkar’s Hindu race’ 15 November     12.30-1.30pm, Room 10, Faculty of HistoryMattin Biglari (SOAS)Refining knowledge: expertise, power, and labour in the Iranian oil industry, 1939-1973 22 November      12.30-1.30pm, Room 10, Faculty of HistoryJamie Banks (Leicester)British imperialism, Indian labour migration, and the consequences of British opium policy  29 November       12.30-1.30pm, Room 10, Faculty of HistoryCatarina Madruga (Lisbon)The Portuguese Third Empire: the appropriation of the African hinterland through taxonomic practices    Seminars take place on Wednesdays between 17.30 and 19.00 in the Junior Parlour, Gonville and Caius College, except where otherwise noted.© 2017 University of Cambridge

As well as having a long-established expertise in British and European history, Cambridge has particular strengths in Extra-European History. While some of the most famous Cambridge historians have focused on political and constitutional history, the Faculty has also played a central role in the development of the history of political thought and in the flourishing fields of economic, social and cultural history. Its members include specialists in business and religious history and in the history of population, the family and gender.Much of the work in these fields is done in collaboration with other Faculties from across the University including African Studies, Divinity and Politics and International Studies. The Faculty recruits outstanding graduate students from all backgrounds across the entire range of the discipline of History. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The MPhils have taught elements but are also research degree in their own right, and many students use them as pathways towards doctoral research.This two-year course is designed to be accessible to those in full- or part-time employment and to international students. It is taught in short intensive study blocks and offers two thematic strands in which students specialise, culminating in a dissertation.The majority of our programmes are offered on a full-time basis and we do not offer a part-time MPhil. The Faculty does accept applications from candidates who wish to undertake the PhD on a part-time basis and more information can be found on our page for part-time students. The part-time Master of Studies in History course is administered by the Institute of Continuing Education, taught jointly by the Faculty of History and the Institute and the degree is awarded by the Faculty of History.  For more information, please see the Master of Studies (MSt) in History page (http://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/mst-history) on the Institute of Continuing Education’s website.  Visiting Graduate StudentsThe Faculty of History welcomes applications from graduate students who wish to visit Cambridge for short periods from one month up to one year.

The MPhil in American History enables students to develop expertise in this ever expanding field of historical scholarship. The MPhil in American History combines taught and research elements over a 9-month programme. The taught elements include three modules, as well as training workshops and seminars, all of which are worth 30% of the final degree mark.  There is also a long final thesis (15,000-20,000 words) worth 70% of the final degree mark. The course is designed for those who have completed degrees in which History is the main or at least a substantial component and who want to consolidate their knowledge of American history. It is particularly appropriate for those who may wish to continue on to a PhD, at Cambridge or elsewhere, in American history.  It is also well-suited for those who seek simply to explore American history at a deeper level. It is expected that this will be the normal means by which those without an appropriate Master’s degree from elsewhere will prepare for the PhD degree in American history at Cambridge.Cambridge graduates in American History have taken up posts in universities and academic-related spheres of work around the world.  The MPhil in American History provides a point of entry into this rich tradition.   Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Each student will take a compulsory core readings course in American history.  This course will include weekly classes in Michaelmas Term on major themes, historiography, and methods, based on key readings, so that students come to a foundational understanding of central themes in American history.  Students will also choose two Options, one in Michaelmas Term and one in Lent Term, from a range of Options in American and other history.  Each of these modules will require a 3,000-4,000 word essay (or equivalent) and will count for 10% of the final mark (so all three modules will count for 30% of the final degree mark).   Those who satisfactorily complete this programme of study will continue on to a research project, closely supervised by one of Cambridge’s outstanding group of American historians. They will be expected to submit a dissertation of between 15,000 and 20,000 words by the middle of June. This dissertation is worth 70% of the final degree mark.The MPhil in American History aims to: By the end of the programme, students will have:Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Each year, there is also a senior Pitt Professor in American History and Institutions who visits for the year from a US institution.  There are visiting scholars from other institutions as well.In addition to the American History seminars, students will be able to attend lectures and research papers at the Centre for Research in Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH).  They may also attend American literature seminars in the English Faculty.The History Faculty has a very wide range of other seminars, which sometimes offer papers of direct relevance to American historians.There is a large suite of undergraduate papers in American history, including survey papers on American History from c. 1500-1865 and American History since 1865. The lectures for undergraduate papers are also open to graduate students. Graduate students are encouraged to attend lectures on topics relevant to their dissertation and option areas, in order to get a sense of the general field in which they are writing.There are strong intellectual links between the American History Subject Group and other Departments and Faculties. Students are able to attend any open lecture courses across the university, without permission, for example those presented by Anthropology, English, Art History, Politics and International Relations, Social and Political Sciences, and the History and Philosophy of Science.  It would be possible to pursue informally American Studies from a multi-disciplinary perspective.    Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

All options are taught as two-hour weekly discussion seminars over eight weeks and attendance is compulsory.For each option, students will be required to write a 3–4,000 words essay which will count towards 10% of the overall mark.Please note that this list of options changes from year to year and options may not run depending on demand and staff availability.  At the discretion of the MPhil Director and Course Convener, students may be able to take options from the Faculty's other MPhil courses in place of an option on their home MPhil, or they may be able to audit additional classes. Early America was a complex, shifting world of nations, colonies, and families that interacted on various levels. Identities were often fluid, and a new life (or world) could be just around the corner. For enslaved persons, building and sustaining bonds of kinship and community proved challenging amid forced migration and brutal labour regimes. For Native Americans, colonial pressures constrained their choices, reduced their numbers, and eventually swallowed up their homelands. Yet time and again people adjusted to the new worlds thrust upon them. Life for colonists was no more static or predictable, even for those who formed “nuclear families” or espoused a belief in predestination and a purified Church. Adaptation, in a word, was key for everyone. How did bonds of kinship and community shape human experience in early North America? In what ways did cultural encounters, migration, enslavement, missionization, and environmental crisis bear on community and identity formation among the continent’s varied populations? What were the general contours of life for non-elites before 1800?This Option course is a graduate foundation seminar in early American history. It covers several, if by no means all, key debates in the field, including Native American and early settler contact, slavery and race, gender and the household, ecology, demography, religion, and revolutions. The course will help students acquire the skills necessary to pursue advanced (PhD) research in early American history as well as topics in social and cultural history. Students will also consider approaches to teaching this subject.Thomas Jefferson once proclaimed the United States to be an “empire of liberty.” For the next century, Americans moved westward in one of the great continual mass migrations in modern history. In doing so, these settlers, aided by the U.S. military, displaced older empires on the North American continent, be they Spanish, French, British, or Native American. In 1898, the United States occupied or annexed territories off its own shores, either nearby (Cuba) or far away (the Philippines); five years later, it acquired sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. And over the course of the twentieth century, the United States evolved from a continental hegemon into a great power, and then again into a global superpower of unprecedented reach and power. To paraphrase the historian William Appleman Williams, to a great extent empire has been an American way of life.But is the United States in fact an empire? Has it ever been one? If so, what kind? Was the seizure of the Philippines a “great aberration,” as the historian Samuel Flagg Bemis once put it? The terms “empire” and “imperialism” are politically loaded, but is it possible to examine U.S. foreign policy through an imperialist lens that is more neutral and scholarly? These are not easy questions, but scholars have offered a wide variety of answers nonetheless. This MPhil option will focus on how historians have considered empire when interpreting the history of American foreign relations, predominantly but not exclusively between 1898 and the present day. It will begin with the definitional problem—how should we define empire in an American context?—before turning to a variety of imperial interpretations of U.S. history, including those that explicitly deny the existence of an American empire.This option will examine the experiences of the more than sixty-five million immigrants who came to America from 1776 to the present. The course will explore a variety of immigrant groups, including the Irish, Italians, Jews, Slavs, Chinese, Mexicans, Muslims, and those from the Caribbean, and will examine their journey, and the journeys of their children, from foreigner to American.The option will also examine the role of immigrants in the making of American nationality. By nationality I mean the definition of who constituted the American people, who was entitled to be a full member (a citizen) of this polity, and what political and cultural traits these citizens were thought (or required) to possess. The presence of so many immigrants on US soil at so many different points of this country's history has made the question of who belonged to American and who could become an American a particularly important and often vexed one. This option will examine the legal, political, and cultural dimensions of nationality. It will explore the different conceptions of American nationality that prevailed at various points in this country's history and will examine the battles over what America was and should be. It will illuminate how American nationality was forged both through mechanisms of inclusion (opening America up to tens of millions of foreign born and successfully transforming them into Americans) and mechanisms of exclusion (identifying groups and ideas thought to have no place in America). Race will receive special attention because of its important role from 1790 until 1965 in defining the boundaries of American nationhood, and in determining who would be allowed to enter America and who among them would be considered eligible for citizenship.This course examines the institutional, ideational, and cultural dimensions of continuity and change in 20th Century American governance. It draws primarily on an interdisciplinary body of "American Political Development" (APD) scholarship - a broad subfield spanning History and Political Science, which combines attention to larger patterns and processes in US political history with rigorous archival research.The course is organized thematically around three major areas of APD scholarship: exploring state-building in the 20th Century, competing political traditions and ideologies, and evolving modes of citizen organization and expression. Students will explore questions of how and why the federal government grew, as well as the limitations on its expansion, and analyse specific policy areas such as welfare, national security, and criminal justice. We'll examine the nature of American liberalism and conservatism and their place in political culture and conflict, and consider the importance of race in shaping the American nation state. We'll also look at party politics and interest group influence over time, including the rise of lobbying and modern election campaigns.In addition to introducing some of the major works in the field, the course will offer students a sense of the different approaches and methods employed in political history, and sketch out important new directions in current scholarship, such as the influence of transnational and international forces in US political history. For those students who wish to pursue a PhD in American history, this course will help build the skills for advanced research.    Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This stimulating course is designed for those who have completed degrees in which History is the main or at least a substantial component and who want to consolidate their knowledge of the period between 1500 and 1800. It aims to deepen students’ understanding of how early modern history has been studied and to explore how traditional and innovative methods can be used to interpret it.The MPhil in Early Modern History combines taught and research elements over a 9-month full-time programme. The taught elements include three modules, as well as training workshops and seminars, and all students will also complete a long piece of independent research (15,000 – 20,000 words).Throughout the course students will be supervised by a dedicated member of staff, who will guide their research towards the completion of an original historical subject chosen and developed by them. In addition, students will benefit from Cambridge’s vibrant research environment, attending and participating in guest talks, workshops and other events throughout the year.The course is designed for those who have completed degrees in which History is the main or at least a substantial component and who want to consolidate their knowledge of early modern history. It is particularly appropriate for those who may wish to continue on to a PhD, at Cambridge or elsewhere.  It is also well-suited for those who seek simply to explore early modern history at a deeper level. It is expected that this will be the normal means by which those without an appropriate Master’s degree from elsewhere will prepare for the PhD degree in Early Modern History at Cambridge.Cambridge graduates in Early Modern History have taken up positions in UK and international universities or followed careers in business, the media, law and politics. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Examples of tasks students might be asked to complete could be to find out as much as possible about an historical person; to examine closely a particular kind of document; to assess problems of attributing authorship of anonymous texts; or to analyse a set of data.The accent in this module is on process not product. It is important to think about skills acquisition, and, for instance, forming judgements about diminishing returns in time spent investigating a problem. What matters is not the achievement of a finished piece of work by the end of the day, but the research processes entailed. A particular feature of this module is that collaborative work is encouraged.The Research Challenge is an extremely popular part of the MPhil in Early Modern History.

Many of those run from within the early modern group of historians are attended by graduate students from adjacent disciplines – English, Modern and Medieval Languages, Theology, Social and Political Sciences, and Law as well as the students taking this course. All are welcome to participate in a range of interdisciplinary workshops and seminars promoted by the University’s prestigious Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH).In addition, the Faculty sponsors a workshop in early modern history run by and for graduate students in the absence of senior members. Its continuation rests solely upon the enthusiasm and commitment of the graduate students themselves. The critical mass of students in the early modern field, one of the largest in the world, provides an excellent opportunity for peer-group learning and support, and this is an outstanding feature of Cambridge life.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It aims to introduce students to the latest research topics, methods and debates in eighteenth-century history. The option is designed for graduate students, primarily those writing dissertations on aspects of the long eighteenth century, but all students in the MPhil in Early Modern History, the MPhil in Modern European History and the MPhil in Modern British History are welcome to take the option.The option takes advantage of the History Faculty’s exceptional and diverse strength in eighteenth-century history and involves the participation of a number of colleagues. It is organized primarily according to key themes in eighteenth-century history; to some extent, these themes also correspond to different methodologies or sub-disciplines.Unlike many MPhil options, the design is (selectively) synoptic, seeking to provide or broaden students’ background. The option will provide an opportunity to reflect on the relations – both compatibilities and incompatibilities – among the themes and methodologies. It is expected that this diverse approach will help students place their own research in the appropriate contexts. The basic assumption of the option is that individual research is enhanced by a thorough and wide understanding of current historical research in the field.The option will be taught in seven two-hour classes in Michaelmas Term. The convenor, Dr Lawrence Klein, will be present at all sessions. Aside from the first, he will be joined by another member of the Faculty who will lead a session organized around a particular theme or methodological approach to the period. The meetings are as follows:Week 1. Introduction: grand narratives of the eighteenth century. Dr Lawrence KleinWeek 2. Enlightenment. Dr Sylvana TomaselliWeek 3. Political culture. Dr Andrew ThompsonWeek 4. No class.Week 5. The sciences. Dr Emma SparyWeek 6. Gender and labour. Dr Amy EricksonWeek 7. Revolution and counter-revolution. Dr Sujit SivasundaramWeek 8. Religion. Dr Matthew NealStudents will be asked to undertake reading in preparation for these classes and, occasionally, to make a short presentation about the reading in the course of the term. A full syllabus will be available in late September.

This Mphil Option examines how and to what end historians can conceive of a ‘global early modernity’. It investigates the analytical frameworks and the historical processes that have made the period 1400-1800 appear to be a new, global age.The course begins with a discussion of concepts, periodization, and geography. In weeks one and two, we will consider the histories of and assumptions behind the projects of ‘early modern’ and ‘global’ history, especially the influence of the social sciences. But we will also study how these concepts have changed as historians studying various parts of the world have adopted and adapted them. Have global frameworks helped us to ‘provincialize’ Europe, or have they allowed European expectations to colonize other historiographical fields?Subsequent classes will address the political, economic, social, and cultural developments seen as foundational to global early modernity. How did early modern transformations differ from nineteenth- and twentieth-century ‘globalizations’? What role did empires play in forging early modern global connections? How did travel and exchange affect local systems of thought? As we examine these arenas, we will discuss various approaches to global history (comparative, connected, microhistorical, material, etc.), and the methodological challenges of each.Class topics will include:Each week, students will read a combination of required and optional texts. While required readings will take students to many different parts of the world, optional readings allow them to focus on a particular region. Class participants will write weekly reading responses and a 2000-word final essay on a topic related to their research.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The course will consider how far this was a distinctive period in the development of such states, and the extent to which it was characterized by continuity or change. The classes will examine some of the different concepts and models that historians have evolved to understand royal government and state formation, and consider whether the term ‘absolutism’ is more of a help or a hindrance to gaining such an understanding.The first class will offer a general introduction to the range of interpretations and methodologies that are found in the vast historiography on this subject. The remaining six classes will focus in turn on institutional approaches; intellectual approaches; the emergence of the fiscal-military state; the nature of the confessional state; the significance of iconography and the visual arts; and the nature of the ceremonial and ritual that surrounded monarchies in the early-modern period.The course integrates British and European themes, and each class will be built around 2-3 key books or articles, at least one of which is primarily British in focus, and at least one primarily European in focus. Students will be expected to become familiar with these assigned readings, and to present to the group on at least one of them during the course of the term.[1] Introduction: themes and approachesJ.H.

The seven classes are likely to include topics such as:The module will be taught in a series of weekly classes of ninety minutes, led by the convenor and with a number of invited speakers or demonstrators. There will be opportunities to see how books were printed and to study techniques of book-binding, as well as to consider topics such as the transition from manuscript to print, the histories of libraries and the early modern book trade, and the history of reading practices. Those taking the course will learn how to make an accurate, bibliographical description of an early modern printed book.It is expected that senior officers in the University Library and other Cambridge Libraries will be involved in teaching this module, and that those taking the module will have an opportunity to visit a number of College libraries.Assessment will be by an essay on some aspect of the course (to be submitted by Friday 1 December) and by evidence of satisfactory attendance.(a) General Reading List: Bibliography and Textual Criticism*Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (Oxford, 1972)Robert Darnton, The Business of Enlightenment (Cambridge, Mass., 1979)Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin, The Coming of the Book, trans.

Objects such as clocks and paintings had a “social life” – they symbolised aspirations, relationships, or the wish to relate to particular dimensions of existence. Power, too, expressed itself symbolically through signs and architecture that marked landscapes and towns. Opposition articulated itself in response to them. Religious and political controversy manifested itself in different images, music and was visualised through clothes and emblems on them.This course examines how we can analyse this rich reservoir of remains and produce original research based on it. It will introduce you to important approaches to the study of visual and material cultures in our period, and this year particularly focus on how a knowledge about how objects were made and what they were made from can inform our analysis of their meaning. The course will include a bronze handling session in the Fitzwilliam Museum with bronze expert Vicky Avery as well as an introduction to the reconstruction of historical dress in this period, with Hilary Davidson, former curator at the Museum of London and contributor to the recent V&A shoes exhibition..Baxandall, Michael, Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy: a Primer in the Social History of a Pictorial Style, OUP 1998.Burke, Peter, Eye–Witnessing: the use of images as historical evidence, Reaktion, London 2001.Rublack, Ulinka, Dressing Up: Cultural Identity in Renaissance Europe (2010).Ludmilla Jordanova, The Look of the Past: visual and material evidence in historical perspective, Cambridge: CUP 2012Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It will not provide a conventional ‘history of medicinal advances or gadgets’ but will provide a history of all manner of medical practitioners, as well as infirmary, dispensary and hospital provision. Despite tripartite divisions between physicians, surgeons and apothecaries there was an active ‘medical market place’ during this period.The course will place the development of the medical ‘profession’ within the context of high mortality rates from a wide range of diseases in the early modern period. The extent of poverty will be assessed, as will the extent of welfare provision (including medical assistance) for the poor through the Old Poor Law. We will also consider charitable provision, such as almshouses and voluntary hospitals.1. Medical knowledge: disease, death and doctors2. Plague, venereal disease and smallpox3.

Much pioneering work in the ‘new’ social history of communities, demographic history, business history and the history of economic thought has been done here. The MPhil in Economic and Social History provides an extremely thorough training in statistical and social science methodology, while building on other strengths such as an emphasis on researching economic relations and institutions as cultural phenomena.There are approximately 20 members of academic staff associated with the MPhil, ranging in specialisation from early modern economic history to modern Asian history. The course teachers are also associated with two major research institutions: the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure and the Centre for History and Economics.Past and current topics for dissertations include:‘The Evolution of Ownership and Control in British IPOs before WWI’‘Consumer protection in Britain from austerity to affluence, 1945-65’‘Plague of Poverty: The World Health Organization, Tuberculosis, and International Development c.1945-1980’‘Encouraging Emigration: An analysis of the Estado Novo regime’s approach to emigration in the early 1960s in Portugal’In addition to the course seminars there are also 16 faculty research seminars and around 320 other graduate students doing MPhils and PhDs. Combined with the excellent resources found in the University library this provides one of the most vibrant historical research cultures in the world.A list of staff involved in research training and course teaching can be found here: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/subject-groups/economic-social-and-cultural-history Many other members of the Cambridge History Faculty may be available to supervise dissertations.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

We examine the history of industrial growth and industrialization beyond the West, focussing on the debates about how far, and why, ‘late’ industrializations have differed from the original industrial revolution and from Western models generally, notably in the role of the state, the organization of production, and the relative preference for capital and labour-intensive technologies respectively. We focus on the economic strategies and changes in their domestic and international political contexts, and (more briefly) discuss the social and cultural dimensions. Not least, we consider the interactions of economies with their physical environments. While the weekly seminars will be framed comparatively, students may focus on individual regions or countries for their essays. The overall aim is to enable students to acquire a critical understanding of the key concepts, empirical methods, and evidence adduced in the debates on this theme.Outline of seminars:1Concepts of ‘late’ Economic Development2The Industrial Revolution and ‘Great Divergence’: Their Implications for Subsequent Development3Manufacturing Growth and the ‘Imperialism of Free Trade’, c.1850-19144Industrialization and ‘De-Globalization’, 1914-455State-Led Economic Development, 1945-c19806Industrialization and Economic Liberalisation, c1980-Present7‘The Great Convergence’ amid the ‘Anthropocene’?8Connections, Comparisons and ConclusionsTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It provides a solid grounding in theoretical approaches to the role of energy in the economy and the modelling of historical energy systems, and a long-term overview of the key developments in energy consumption and extraction. The course proceeds roughly chronologically, using key case studies to examine contentious issues in the history of energy, their relationship with wider economic and social trends, and particular methodological approaches from Ecological Economics to Science and Technology Studies. Themes covered will include the role and necessity of coal in the Industrial Revolution; the development, diffusion and impact of the steam engine as a general purpose technology; debates and crises over energy scarcity from 'wood shortage' to repeated 20th century fears of 'peak oil'; understanding the transformation of energy flows in different forms of agriculture from 1850 to the present; adoption of new household energy technology and consumer behaviour; comparative study of energy policy debates, especially with regard to nuclear power; and the perception and policy response to pollution from burning fossil fuels. Case studies will primarily draw on examples from Britain, Europe and North America but include global perspectives.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It surveys a series of key policy areas, ranging across social, economic, environmental and foreign policy, aiming to give students both a broad understanding of the relevant policy issues, as well as the way in which policymaking has changed over time. Each session will be themed around a problem, such as the regulation of prostitution or the challenges of an ageing population. The sessions will be interactive, and will provide space for discussion of the present-day relevance of historical perspectives and the uses of history in public life. The overall aim will be to give students a broad grounding in historical and contemporary policy making, and the practical skills to shape their own research for impact outside of the academy.Assessment:This module will be assessed by the preparation of a 3000 word policy paper, modelled on those published by History & Policy, and an accompanying 1000 word action plan for policy influence. The policy paper will present an aspect of contemporary policy, and show how understanding the issue in historical perspective can connect it to wider/novel agendas, offer new policy options/forms of delivery/implementation, or recast the issue. The action plan will outline practical, evaluable means of gaining the attention of diverse audiences of policy makers and opinion formers.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Malthusian pressures were the norm and increases in population were normally accompanied by declines in living standards.  The Industrial Revolution saw the British economy escape from Malthusian constraints and marks the world’s first transition to modern economic growth.  The course considers the processes by which Britain became the first nation to overcome growth constraints and embark on a path of sustained expansion of per capita income. It looks at the roles played by structural change, new sources of energy and raw materials, agricultural improvement, high wages, new technology, changes in labour supply and much else.  The course covers key debates both on the causes of industrialisation and the consequences for the people who lived through it. It looks at the following main topics: Aims of the courseThe aims of this course are to introduce students to the main debates, conceptual tools and empirical findings that are central to understanding British economic history during the Industrial Revolution.Objectives of the courseBy the end of this course students should have acquired a good understanding of the key debates surrounding Britain's industrialisation and the welfare implications of the changes that occurred. They should be familiar with the various methodologies and data sources employed and have knowledge of recent empirical findings.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The course is devised using a wide canvas with the intention of exploring the manner in which institutions have been conceptualised and analysed across individual disciplines in the social sciences. The lecture course brings together theoretical perspectives alongside both historical and current evidence on the interrelations between institutional structures and social and economic actions.The course undertakes an institutional analysis drawing on concepts and frameworks provided by the disciplines of economics, sociology, political science, law and anthropology. The lectures examine the institutions of the state, notably the role of the bureaucracy and judiciary; societal institutions such as NGOs and social groups, customary norms such as culture and caste that affect human development. Individual lectures explore institutions such as the market, firm and the state, examine the perspectives of different academic schools such as New Institutional Economics, Marxism, Human Development and Capability theory on institutional changes, and give due consideration to how key development concerns such as poverty, environment and education can be examined through an institutional lens.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

But how inequalities between countries, groups and individuals have appeared, evolved and been challenged throughout history is seldom debated. This course will bring together economic, social and political perspectives in exploring how unequal outcomes (such as income, health or capability) have been created, sustained and challenged across the globe and throughout History. This will involve an economic history of distribution and development, intersected with a history of ideas about equality and inequality, and with a social history of the categories that sustain difference, including (but not limited to) gender, race, and religion. How did medieval societies think about fairness, and how did people interact across marked social divides, such as free and serf, townsman and noblewoman? How did traders, missionaries and sovereigns manage increasingly diverse empires, where new opportunities challenged established social hierarchies? How did social categories such as race and gender feature in the postwar ‘Age of Equality’? Working across diverse periods and regions and with both qualitative and quantitative sources, this course will also bring history into dialogue with other disciplines, such as economics, sociology and political theory. Seminar Topics Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Needham)This course introduces students to the theory and practice of the various institutions that have facilitated international trade and wealth creation since the nineteenth century.  Some of these emerged organically, others were planned responses to economic collapse and global conflagration.  All relied upon some level of credibility and cooperation between competing nation states.  We shall look at the emergence of the classical Gold Standard that underpinned globalisation in the late nineteenth century.  The First World War shattered the intricate web of international trade and, despite the attempt to reconstitute the pre-war Gold Standard, the global economy collapsed with the competitive devaluations and protectionism of the 1930s.  At Bretton Woods in 1944, the planners of the post-war international economy sought to combine the discipline of the Gold Standard with the flexibility of adjustable exchange rates.  Over the next quarter-century, the world enjoyed unprecedented economic growth as international trade returned to levels not witnessed since before the First World War.  However, the Bretton Woods Gold Exchange Standard contained the seeds of its own destruction, and its collapse in the early 1970s marked the abrupt end of the Golden Age of Capitalism.  The leading European nations used the ensuing period of economic improvisation to develop the European Monetary System that ultimately gave birth to the European single currency.  The course finishes by taking students up to the present by examining how the flaws within this system led to the Euro crisis.  It places the crisis in historical perspective by showing today’s policy makers wrestling with essentially the same theoretical and practical issues as their predecessors over the past century. Seminar Topics Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This paper examines more closely the relationship between economic growth and health according to the detailed historical record. The richly-documented British case will provide a central focus but comparative material will be considered. The course will explore the complexities of the relationship between economic growth and health, and the need to understand the crucial role of social institutions and political conflict in determining health outcomes for populations participating in rapid economic change. Students will be encouraged to pursue contemporary implications of policy relevance.Seminar TopicsPart IClass 1: Post-war development orthodoxies and approaches to population healthClass 2: Alternative interpretations of the core evidence: modern Britain's epidemiological historyPart IIClasses 3-7: The relationship between economic growth, health and politics in Britain since 1750Class 3-1750-1815, Class 4- 1815-1870, Classes 5 & 6 1850-1914Class 7-Since 1914Part IIIClass 8 Critical reflections on health, politics and economic developmentTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It will not provide a conventional ‘history of medicinal advances or gadgets’ but will provide a history of all manner of medical practitioners, as well as infirmary, dispensary and hospital provision. Despite tripartite divisions between physicians, surgeons and apothecaries there was an active ‘medical market place’ during this period. The course will place the development of the medical ‘profession’ within the context of high mortality rates from a wide range of diseases in the early modern period. The extent of poverty will be assessed, as will the extent of welfare provision (including medical assistance) for the poor through the Old Poor Law. We will also consider charitable provision, such as almshouses and voluntary hospitals. Seminar Topics Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is done in the first instance through the Central Concepts in Economic and Social History course, and more specifically, in a choice of two courses from a list of specific topics offered by staff members in History and in related Social Sciences. Students are also expected to undertake training in social science research methods, encompassing quantitative and qualitative analytical tools, which are taught at all levels, from beginner to advanced.Throughout the course students will be supervised by a dedicated member of staff, who will guide their research towards the completion of an original historical subject chosen and developed by them. In addition students will benefit from Cambridge’s vibrant research environment in Economic and Social History, attending and participating in guest talks, workshops and other events throughout the year.By the end of the course, students should have:Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is assessed on a Pass/Fail basis but where a student fails the essay it must be compensated with a mark of at least 63% in the dissertation. Students will meet with their Supervisor to discuss the essay and get feedback in preparation for the dissertation.The thesis is Part II of the MPhil in Economic and Social History.All students will submit a thesis of 15,000-20,000 words in mid-August, worth 70% of the overall mark. At the discretion of the Examiners the examination may include an oral examination on the thesis and on the general field of knowledge within which it falls.All students will present their work at least once during the academic year and will receive feedback from academics and peers on their work-in-progress. This is not an assessed element of the course but is a valuable feedback tool for the dissertation.Students are also required to pass the Social Sciences Research Methods courses, and may be required to take a practical assessment as part of these courses.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is expected that it accounts for approximately 60 per cent of the student’s time over the eleven months of the course.Candidates are required to design, research and write up a dissertation on a subject in the fields of economic and/or social history that has been approved by the Faculty of History. The dissertation must be between 15,000 and 20,000 words in length, inclusive of tables and appendices, and exclusive of footnotes and bibliography.Candidates must demonstrate that they can present a coherent historical argument based upon a secure knowledge and understanding of primary sources and they will be expected to place their research findings within the existing historiography of the field within which their subject lies.  The dissertation must represent a contribution to knowledge, considering what may be reasonably expected of a capable and diligent student after eleven months of MPhil level study.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

They provide research students with a broad range of quantitative and qualitative research methods skills that are relevant across the social sciences. The programme offered by the SSRMC consists of a series of core modules and open access seminars. The core modules are grouped in three categories: Foundations in Statistics, Advanced Statistics, and Qualitative Methods. They focus on giving students basic IT skills and introducing them to statistical, quantitative and qualitative research design, providing the foundations for a research career in the social sciences.Students doing the MPhil in Economic and Social History must take a number of SSRMC options, to be published at the beginning of the year, and may choose to take additional modules. Students are advised to check with their supervisors whether it would be advisable to attend other modules within The Social Science Research Methods Course relevant to their research, and they are encouraged to take as many modules as they wish beyond those required for the MPhil.   Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This rich history makes Cambridge an ideal place to study medieval history.The MPhil in Medieval History forms an integral part of the teaching and research in the Cambridge History Faculty, which is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. The redesigned course for 2017-18 offers students intensive training in medieval concepts and methods and helps students to develop skills in Latin and Palaeography which they will use to research a key theme in medieval history.The MPhil in Medieval History combines taught and research elements over a 9-month full-time programme. The taught elements include taught modules on research topics and skills training, training workshops and seminars, and all students will also complete a long piece of independent research (15,000 – 20,000 words).Throughout the course the student will be supervised by a dedicated member of staff, who will guide research on the subject that he or she has chosen, leading to the completion of an original piece of historical research in the form of a dissertation. In addition, students will benefit from Cambridge’s vibrant research environment by participating in classes, workshops and other events, and by attending seminars given by guest speakers.The course is designed for those who have completed degrees in which History is the main or at least a substantial component and who want to consolidate their knowledge of medieval history. It is particularly appropriate for those who may wish to continue on to a PhD, at Cambridge or elsewhere.  It is also well-suited to those who seek simply to explore medieval history at a deeper level. It is expected that this will be the normal means by which those without an appropriate Master’s degree from elsewhere will prepare for the PhD degree in medieval history at Cambridge.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

web browser if you wish but then our site may not work correctly.Faculty of HistoryStudying at CambridgeStudents will study two core modules in Michaelmas and will chose one from a number of option modules in Lent. The option modules offered each year may vary.Typical options offered may include:Medieval Manuscript StudiesThis unit provides an introduction to the use of medieval manuscript evidence, drawing upon the rich manuscript collections of the Cambridge colleges, University Library and Fitzwilliam Museum. Modern editions are an incomplete and sometimes misleading lens through which to examine the texts that were composed, copied, handled, read and heard during the Middle Ages. First-hand analysis of medieval manuscripts brings us closer to the ways in which their contents were encountered by medieval audiences, and contributes to our understanding of both the significance of those texts to those by whom and for whom they were produced as well as the practical means by which literature, knowledge and ideas were transmitted. This unit will provide instruction in the analysis of the physical structure of manuscripts, the identification of their contents and the forms of evidence for their place of origin and history of ownership and use, and the scholarly conventions of manuscript description. The manuscripts studied will range in date from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries but there will be a particular focus upon those containing texts that record or were used to mark the passage of time: from chronicles and historical narratives to saints’ lives, sermon collections and liturgical calendars. (note: this Option may also be attended by MPhil in Medieval History students who have not chosen it as their assessed Option but who wish to gain additional manuscript skills, and by MPhil and PhD students from both the History Faculty and other Departments and Faculties who require training in medieval codicology.) The Byzantine EmpireByzantium was an empire whose rulers prided themselves on the ideological, cultural and religious continuity of the East Roman state and on Constantinople’s direct legacy from the Roman Empire of antiquity.Beneath the rhetoric of imperial continuity, however, it was also a world which underwent profound crisis in the seventh and eighth centuries caused by escalating warfare with the Sasanian empire of Persia and the nascent power of Islam.This option provides students with the opportunity to study how the medieval empire of Byzantium both preserved and re-cast its late antique political, cultural and religious heritage. At the same time, it aims to introduce students to the key auxiliary skills necessary for advanced work in Byzantine studies by studying the transition from late antiquity to the age of the Macedonian emperors through the specific types of evidence on which the Byzantinist must rely.The classes will deal in turn, therefore, with processes of continuity and crisis as revealed by the evolution of Byzantine historiography, hagiography, numismatics, sigillography, epigraphy and archaeology, legal sources, and Byzantine art and architecture. In addition to studying Latin, those without Greek should consult the option leader for advice about language instruction. Law and SocietyLaw and legal ideas penetrated medieval society in a multitude of ways; medieval people became if anything increasingly ‘law-minded’ as the era progressed. Focusing mostly on the period between the 12th and the 14th centuries, this 8-week course will give students the opportunity to explore the variety of legal systems and jurisdictions in existence in medieval Europe, their intellectual underpinnings and their use by a wide range of ‘consumers’. Laws and courts operating under secular authority will be considered alongside those of the church, as well as the often disputed boundaries between the two. The option will also address legal education and learning, and the role of lawyers and other legal professionals in society. There is also likely to be a particular focus on popular legal culture, and on the distinctions between legal and extra-legal modes of dispute resolution. By the end of the course students will have become familiar with primary sources including foundational legal texts and codes, records of lawsuits, and materials which reveal social attitudes to law and lawyers. They also will have grasped key historiographical trends in the study of the interactions between medieval law and society.Religion and PowerOnce thought of as the ‘Age of Faith’, recent work on the middle ages has demonstrated how complex and variegated belief could be. The exploration of the intersection of  ‘religion’ – being bound by the law of faith – and power highlights crucial aspects of medieval society. This 8-week course will explore a number of conjunctions of religion and power, spanning from the highest to the lowest in medieval society. The terrain covered will fall mainly within the central and later middle ages, and will focus mostly on Catholic Europe, whilst also including Christian relations with and understandings of Judaism and Islam. We will engage with a variety of source material and historiographical debates to consider areas such as the Peace of God movement, the authority of the papacy, the powers of medieval inquisitors and bishops, the sanctity and virtus of saints, the regulation of religious minorities, uses of the afterlife, pious practices as well as theological ideas, and the gendered experience of faith in the middle ages.   Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The tailored, individual and closely supervised dissertation work is complemented by the importance placed in the course of group work and the creation of a supportive intellectual community. You'll emerge with excellent skills for undertaking advanced research, and a degree that will be highly valued in institutions across the world. The advanced research and writing skills gained will also be of immediate use in a wide variety of occupations.British History at the University of Cambridge combines the study of the individual polities and nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland with the study of their interactions with one another, with the European Continent and the British Empire.  It draws on established strengths across the Faculty in political thought, political history, economic history, social and cultural history and global history to consider Britain’s modern experience in the light of these broader geographical and analytical perspectives. The MPhil in Modern British History offers taught courses and a dissertation over a 9-month programme.  Students take three courses in the first two terms – a common core course focusing on historiographical debates and thematic approaches, and two optional courses, including several comparative options, which allow students to develop their interests and/or contextualize their dissertation research.The 15–20,000 word dissertation is the centrepiece of the course, and will be planned and undertaken through close work with your supervisor. Regular supervisions will enable the identification of key questions and ideas to address, as well as archival sources and a sense of the wider significance of your research. The supervisor will be chosen prior to admission according to your research interests, and will assist you throughout the course to make the most of the very full intellectual resources that Cambridge can offer.  Tweets by @CamModBritTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

How is it related historiographically to ‘national’ and imperial histories, to European and global history?  Should we be seeking to replace established narratives of Whig, Marxist and liberal historiography with new narratives or is a more plural, even fragmentary approach the right one for historians?  What if anything is distinctive about the British experience in modern times; how seriously should we take the claims for Britain as the first ‘modern’ state and nation; in light of what transnational histories is Britain best considered; what does it mean to study modern British history from a ‘four nations’ perspective? The core course is compulsory for all students enrolled in the MPhil in Modern British History. It is historiographically based, engaging students with key scholarship, classic texts, and their revisions. The classes will be organized around a mix of introductory lectures by an established historian, and a graduate student or a postdoc showing how these debates affect their own research. Our reading will follow eight key lines of historical inquiry: Tweets by @CamModBritTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Please note that this list of options changes from year to year.Assessment for each option: Essay: 3-4,000 words Approaches to the Long Eighteenth Century (Dr Renaud Morieux)This Option is an advanced introduction to eighteenth-century history, primarily focusing on Britain and Europe. It aims to introduce students to the latest research topics, methods and debates in eighteenth-century history. The Option is designed for graduate students, primarily those writing dissertations on aspects of the long eighteenth century, but all students in the MPhil in Early Modern History and the MPhil in Modern European History are welcome to take the Option.The Option takes advantage of the History Faculty’s exceptional and diverse strength in eighteenth-century history and involves the participation of a number of colleagues. It is organised primarily as a series of approaches to eighteenth- century history from the standpoint of different methodologies or sub-disciplines.Unlike many MPhil Options, the design is (selectively) synoptic, seeking to provide or broaden students’ background. The Option will provide an opportunity to reflect on the relations – both compatibilities and incompatibilities – among different historical sub-disciplines and methodologies. It is expected that this diverse approach will help students place their own research in the appropriate contexts. The basic assumption of the option is that individual research is enhanced by a thorough and wide understanding of current historical research in the field.  Class and Social Mobility in the Long twentieth Century (Dr Jon Lawrence)In recent years historians of modern Britain have explored the history of class from a variety of new and exciting perspectives. Where once class was seen as the answer to any historical question, it is now more often seen as a question to be answered – what did people mean when they talked about class; how did class differences structure social relationship whether or not it was spoken about; has class lost its power to explain inequalities of power etc? Here, we explore the question of class through a variety of lenses, always interrogating both contemporary primary sources and key historical interpretations. We examine how social difference shaped the whole project to ‘know’ poverty and the world of labour; how class differences became encoded into political language, and why even Labour always had a troubled relationship with the ‘politics of class’; how, and with what consequences, family life and community came to be viewed through the lens of class in the mid-20th century; how the balance in public policy between social mobility and social equality shifted across the twentieth century; and finally whether class survives as a viable language of social description, analysis and criticism in the twenty-first century.  Sexuality and Gender (Dr Lucy Delap)This MPhil option aims to introduce students to a range of methodological and critical approaches in the history of gender and sexuality, through examination of a series of case studies spanning roughly 1850-2000. Through seminar debates and examination of sources, students will explore how questions of gender and sexuality have been framed, approached and presented in recent scholarship. This option will provide a strong grounding in some emerging and innovative fields of historical inquiry, including queer history, parenting and childhood and histories of war. The two opening sessions will look at theoretical developments and ways of framing the history of sexuality and of feminism. A further five classes will explore different facets of the history of sexuality and gender, and a final class will allow students to present their assessed work ahead of submission.  History and Public Policy (Dr Lucy Delap and Prof. Simon Szreter)This course introduces students to the broad landscape of policy making – the processes and actors within government, civil society, and discusses the ways in which an understanding of history can be relevant and enriching to policy makers.  It surveys a series of key policy areas, ranging across social, economic, environmental and foreign policy, aiming to give students both a broad understanding of the relevant policy issues, as well as the way in which policy making has changed over time. Each session will be themed around a problem, such as the regulation of prostitution or the challenges of an ageing population.  The sessions will be interactive, and will provide space for discussion of the present-day relevance of historical perspectives and the uses of history in public life. The overall aim will be to give students a broad grounding in historical and contemporary policy making, and the practical skills to shape their own research for impact outside of the academy.     Tweets by @CamModBritTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is designed both for students who want to enhance their understanding of the social, cultural, political and economic history of modern Europe, and for those who want to go on further primary research. It provides intensive research training for those who wish to go on to prepare a doctoral dissertation, but it is also a freestanding postgraduate degree course in its own right.The course covers Europe from roughly the middle of the eighteenth century to the present. The principal countries studied are France, Germany, Russia, Italy and Spain. It offers an introduction to key themes and selected topics in Modern European History, as well as intensive methodological and historiographical training. Particular attention is paid to the production of an independently conceived, lengthy piece of original research.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is particularly appropriate for those who may wish to continue on to a PhD, at Cambridge or elsewhere, in this field. It is also well-suited for those who seek simply to deepen their grasp of Modern European history.

Each student will take a compulsory core course on major historiographical controversies, drawing on specialist lecturers and key readings. Spanning the first two terms, the course provides a foundational understanding of central themes in Modern European History. Students will also choose two Options from a range of courses provided each year, evolving with the research interests of Faculty members currently teaching on the MPhil. The majority of these will be taught in the Michaelmas term, although some may take place in Lent.In the second part of the course, during the Lent and Easter terms, students will write a substantial dissertation based on independent research, with the aid of a supervisor who will be a specialist in the field in which their dissertation falls.  Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Both parts must be passed in order to pass the MPhil.Each Option requires an essay of no more than 4,000 words (or equivalent in case of an external Option, in accordance with its arrangements) which will count for 10% of the final mark. Together the Core course and Options form Part I and will count for 30% of the final degree mark. Satisfactory performance across all three essay-based components will be a necessary condition for proceeding to the dissertation element of the degree. The dissertation will count for 70% of the final mark. The Easter Term will be devoted to the production of a dissertation, which must be between 15,000 and 20,000 words long. In consultation with the supervisor, both dissertation topic and title must be submitted for approval by the MPhil Sub-Committee towards the end of January. The dissertation is expected to rest largely on original source material and to show evidence of the mastery of the appropriate research techniques. It does not necessarily have to be publishable.All work (course-work and dissertation) will be assessed by two examiners, one of whom may be an external examiner, who will report independently. The supervisor cannot act as an examiner for the dissertation. If the examiners consider it necessary, they may conduct an oral examination on the MPhil dissertation. All parts of the MPhil assessment must be passed in order for the degree to be obtained.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The aim is twofold.First: to explore the recent past in the same spirit as more distant history, reconstructing what happened and what life was like, and formulating big explanatory questions to act as a guide. How sustainable was Soviet rule? How legitimate was Soviet authority? How likely was the collapse of the USSR? Which Soviet norms conditioned life under Yeltsin and Putin? Second, and simultaneously: self-consciously to discuss this topic as the history of our own time. Can one write a history of the USSR and Russia of the last forty-five years? What is past and what is present? What is a primary source and what is a secondary source? How does the work of historians stack up against that of social scientists -- and journalists? Where does objectivity fit in?We will draw on historical scholarship, research in other academic disciplines, memoirs, reportage and travel accounts, published oral histories, official documents, literature, the press, and TV news clips in order to analyse, as historians, the Russia of our times. Students will leave the course with deepened knowledge of recent Russian and Soviet history, as well as a heightened conceptual awareness of the potency and pitfalls of ‘contemporary history’.  Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Rather than being a mere pawn in the Cold War game, however, the Europeans increasingly developed their own distinctive roles in this process, as the continent recovered from wartime destruction and reasserted its position on the global stage.This option addresses two interrelated themes – how Europe was shaped by the Cold War, and how Europeans shaped the Cold War themselves. It focuses primarily on inter-state relations both between the superpowers and the major European states themselves, but attention will also be given to domestic ramifications, the changing political economy, and wider processes such as globalisation. Students will be exposed to cutting-edge research in the field, as well as to key primary sources.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This course aims to explore a variety of movements and ideologies that emerged in the early twentieth-century Europe, and which might be labelled as fascist. Examining the similarities and differences between those movements, the course seeks to uncover the complex nexus of ideas that underpinned this contested concept. What are the defining characteristics of fascism? Can we talk about fascism in the singular? If so, what are the common denominators uniting the various fascist movements? The classes will cover not only Italy and Germany, but also Austria, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. Finally, the course will consider the continuing legacy of fascism into the present. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It also welcomes students whose previous study had a more specialised historical or theoretical (or philosophical) bent, provided that while doing this course they are willing to engage themselves with both approaches to research.This MPhil attracts students from all over the world, and its training provides an ideal foundation from which to proceed to doctoral research, not only in the United Kingdom, but in North American, European, Asian and Southern Hemisphere university systems.The illustration represents the figure of ACADEMIA, is taken from the 1630 edition of Cesare Ripa’s famous Iconologia, which was first published in Rome in 1593. Initially Ripa's book included no illustrations and the first set of woodcuts were added in 1603. The 1630 version included yet more pictures, including that of ‘ACADEMIA’. In this case the iconography itself was also new; it was the contribution of the editor, Giovanni Zaratino Castellino.The 1709 London edition gave the following brief summary of Castellino’s elucidation of the moral emblem of ‘ACADEMY’:  ‘A Lady of a manly heroic Aspect, having a Crown of Gold, a particolur’d Garment, a File in her right Hand, and a Garland in her left. Her masculine Countenance denotes solid and Profound Judgment; the Crown of pure Gold, the refining of Notions by Experiments; the various Colours, the variety of Sciences in an Academy; the File, the polishing of pieces, and freeing them from Superfluities; the Garland, Honour to those who excel’.The motto around the file says ‘Detrahit Atque Polit’ (i.e. ‘It Removes and Polishes’). The garland at the left hand of ‘ACADEMIA’ is made up of laurel, ivy and myrtle, the plants of Apollo, Bacchus and Venus, and pomegranates, the symbol of a group brought together out of common preoccupations. Behind the throne of ‘ACADEMIA’ is seated a bearded ape, or baboon, the symbol of letters, the animal consecrated to Mercury, the inventor of arts and letters. The ape is also a symbol for the equinox, a measurement of time (the academician must measure the hours carefully, spending most of them in study), and for imitation (the beginning of learning, according to Aristotle).Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It offers a thorough training in the key techniques of higher-level academic study and research.The MPhil is inter-Faculty: History, Politics, and Classics are the participating departments. The teaching staff, and examiners, have diverse disciplinary backgrounds, as do students on the course.After completion of the MPhil in Political Thought and Intellectual History, students should have:Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The eighteen classes (8 + 4 + 6) involve studying the history of political thought or intellectual history through a close study of texts, an introduction to methodological issues, and discussion of key themes in political theory. Their purpose is to introduce students to the advanced study of selected texts and debates, both for their own sake and as models for the pursuit of research in related areas. Because of the broad range of students on the course, not all will find the subjects of all classes equally close to their own research concerns.  Nonetheless all are required to participate actively in order to benefit from the general educational opportunity offered by these classes.In one term a pair of alternative textual classes is normally offered, to cater for diverging interests along a rough chronological divide and also to keep class sizes down to a level compatible with intensive participatory work. Students will be assigned to one or the other class by decision of the Academic Secretary. Concurrently, a series of four classes is offered, designed to introduce students to key methodological issues in the history of political thought, including the ‘Cambridge school’ and other approaches.In the other term a further three series of six classes each is offered to facilitate the understanding of fundamental themes and concepts in political thought. Students will be invited to list their first and second choices and the Academic Secretary will do his best to accommodate preferences while keeping numbers roughly balanced between the three series. Short reading lists are usually issued for each class and students are expected to participate actively in each class.Classes vary from year to year.  The teaching programme for 2015-16 is given below:Michaelmas(8 classes)(8 classes)(4 classes) 'Grotius', The Rights of War and Peace  (Dr A Brett)Hegel, Philosophy of Right (Dr C Meckstroth)Methods in the History of Political Thought (Dr J Isaac)Lent(6 classes) Architecture and Political Theory (Dr D Bell)The Crowd (Dr J Isaac)Distributive Justice (Dr C Brooke)Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Graduate students in Cambridge are expected to have the capacity, and enthusiasm, for organising their own research and to work largely on their own initiative. The Supervisor will be an expert in the student's area of research interest and will guide the student’s entire programme of study. For more information see the Faculty's pages on Supervision.The Supervisor’s role is to help students to clarify their own ideas and formulate their research strategy, not to impose his or her own interests on the student or act as an undergraduate teacher. The general norm for supervisory assistance is one supervision every two weeks during the eight weeks of each full term.Students are expected to produce written work in advance for their Supervisor’s comment at most meetings and not to meet only for general discussion. Supervisors on the other hand are obliged to offer constructive comments on these written submissions and guide students towards the timely completion of their examination work.Students will produce two 5,000-6,000 word essays, one in Michaelmas Term and another in Lent Term.Each will count toward 25% of the final degree, for a total of 50%.  The two essays together constitute Part I of the MPhil, and students must receive passing marks in order to move to Part II.Students will also prepare a 2,000-word dissertation proposal essay due in the Lent Term. This essay will be unassessed but students will meet with their Supervisor to discuss the essay and get feedback in preparation for the dissertation.For these essays Students may choose to work with a different essay supervisor from their overall supervisor for one or both of these essays (subject to availability of the desired supervisor). Such sub-contracting can be a useful way for students to benefit from the wide range of expertise available in Cambridge, but should be arranged in consultation with the overall Supervisor in order to plan a coherent course of research for the year.The thesis is Part II of the MPhil in Political Thought and History.All students will submit a thesis of 15,000-20,000 words, worth 50% toward the final degree. At the discretion of the Examiners the examination may include an oral examination on the thesis and on the general field of knowledge within which it falls.All students will present their work at least once during the academic year and will receive feedback from academics and peers on their work-in-progress. This is not an assessed element of the course but is a valuable feedback tool for the dissertation.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This seminar, which takes place weekly during Michaelmas and Lent Terms and in the first four weeks of Easter Term, offers papers on a diverse array of topics by well-known scholars from outside Cambridge and by Cambridge faculty and advanced graduate students.The purpose of these sessions is to acquaint students with current frontline research and to teach them the skills of advanced academic debate. Most of the teaching staff of the MPhil are regular participants and the seminar is also the meeting place for PhD students and Junior Research Fellows working on these subjects in Cambridge. The seminar alternates between sessions led by Faculty members and those directed by Post-doctoral Fellows and graduate students. The seminar therefore helps to integrate MPhil students into the wider academic and graduate student community.MPhil students in Political Thought and Intellectual History are expected to attend all the Monday Research Seminars and encouraged to participate in the discussion after the papers. There is also an informally organised postgraduate research seminar without Faculty being present in which MPhil students are encouraged to participate. Further information on the research seminars, and other related activities, can be found on the website of the Cambridge Centre for Political Thought and the Faculty's Seminar pages.The Faculty of History and Department of Politics and International Studies offer an extraordinarily wide variety of lecture courses in the subject areas covered by the MPhil. While these lectures are primarily aimed at undergraduates, most of them are given at a level challenging enough both for MPhil and PhD students. Attendance at lectures in Cambridge is not compulsory but students are strongly encouraged to follow those lectures that fall within their research areas. Please see the Faculty's pages for the current year's lecture list. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

While there are no fixed course classes in the Easter Term when students will be concentrating on their dissertation, they will be required to present their work at a Dissertation Workshop and encouraged to continue attending lectures and seminars.Postgraduate students in Cambridge are expected to work continuously throughout the year with the exception of a few days’ break at a time, so that the ‘vacation periods’ are in fact periods in which required work must be completed, as shown below.  Individual research/written work to be examined Essay 1Preparation for Essay 2 and Dissertation Essay 2DissertationDissertationGroup study: Taught classesMandatory text reading class Mandatory methods class-----------------Mandatory thematic class --------------Dissertation Abstract SeminarOther group study: research seminarWeekly research seminar-----------------Weekly research seminar---------------Weekly research seminar (first four weeks)Other group study: lecturesLectures-----------------Lectures--------------Lectures(first four weeks) Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The dissertation may be a direct continuation of the topics already chosen for the Research Essays or it may open up relatively new areas of research.It is essential that students give thought to their dissertation plans from the moment they embark on the course. They will be required to provide evidence of preliminary research on the dissertation at the beginning of the Lent Term, and shortly afterwards to submit the proposed title of their dissertation, together with a descriptive statement of 500-1000 words and a page of bibliography. The dissertation ought to be designed in such a way as to help students to find their own distinctive research topic for subsequent PhD study and is therefore seen as a direct preparatory contribution to the candidate's envisaged doctoral research.All Cambridge research degrees (MPhil, MSc, MLitt, PhD) require some contribution to learning as an examination requirement. While the PhD requires a 'significant' contribution to learning, the criteria for the two-year MLitt degree is a 'useful' contribution, and the MPhil requires ‘a contribution’. Although provisional decisions concerning admission to a PhD programme (in Cambridge or elsewhere) are often taken before dissertations are completed, in the end it is the quality of the dissertation which is regarded as the chief criterion of an MPhil student’s suitability for being granted ‘leave to continue’ to the PhD.An oral examination will only be required in cases where one of the marks is a marginal fail.Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It draws upon the expertise of faculty members in each of these areas, as well as in Middle Eastern, Oceanic and American history. The MPhil in World History enables students to develop strong expertise in this rich and expanding field of historical scholarship.The MPhil in World History combines courses and a dissertation over a 9-month program. The core course focuses on historiographical debates in world history, leading to two options, usually in the history of a world region. From the first term, students also begin directed research for a 15,000 word dissertation, working closely with their supervisor from the Faculty’s World History Subject Group. Students will also take language classes, a component that is required but not examined. This may be in any language offered by the Cambridge University Language Centre, and may be elementary, continuing or advanced. In this way, the MPhil in World History offers students thorough preparation for an advanced research degree that will be highly valued in institutions across the world.Tweets by @CamWorldHistoryTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

How is it related historiographically to global and imperial history, to area studies, and to postcolonialism? The core course is compulsory for all students enrolled in the MPhil in World History. It will be convened and taught by Alison Bashford, Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History. It is historiographically based, engaging students with key scholarship, classic texts, and their revisions. Several origins and traditions of world history, global history, transnational history, and regional history will be established and questioned in student-led seminar discussion.

Please note that this list of options changes from year to year.               Flows of capital and of labor, exchange of ideas and commodities, destruction of environments, expansion of empire: is this the face of globalization in our own time, or in earlier centuries as well? This Mphil Option examines how and to what end historians can conceive of a ‘global early modernity’. It investigates the analytical frameworks and the historical processes that have made the period 1400-1800 appear to be a new, global age.The course begins with a discussion of concepts, periodization, and geography. In weeks one and two, we will consider the histories of and assumptions behind the projects of ‘early modern’ and ‘global’ history, especially the influence of the social sciences. But we will also study how these concepts have changed as historians studying various parts of the world have adopted and adapted them. Have global frameworks helped us to ‘provincialize’ Europe, or have they allowed European expectations to colonize other historiographical fields?Subsequent classes will address the political, economic, social, and cultural developments seen as foundational to global early modernity. How did early modern transformations differ from nineteenth- and twentieth-century ‘globalizations’? What role did empires play in forging early modern global connections? How did travel and exchange affect local systems of thought? As we examine these arenas, we will discuss various approaches to global history (comparative, connected, microhistorical, material, etc.), and the methodological challenges of each.Class topics will include:Each week, students will read a combination of required and optional texts. While required readings will take students to many different parts of the world, optional readings allow them to focus on a particular region. Class participants will write weekly reading responses and a 2000-word final essay on a topic related to their research.Michaelmas Term: 2 hour seminar per week x 8 weeksAssessment: Essay, 3–4,000 wordsPrint Cultures in African History: Publics, Politics and Identities (Dr Ruth Watson) From the late nineteenth century onwards, Africa was witness to a proliferation of various forms of print and writing, produced for eager, locally grown audiences. All sorts of texts, including serialised novels, newspapers, pamphlets, tracts, local histories, self-help booklets and vernacular literature became available for public consumption. Taking these printed and written sources as its starting point, this MPhil option course reclaims African print cultures as a domain of historical study. By exploring how various forms of textual production provided a space for innovation and creativity in colonial Africa, it offers a window into processes of rapid social and political change. We will interrogate the commonly assumed distinction between oral and written forms of cultural production by exploring the textual forms, new vocabularies, and political narratives that people in Africa constructed through their engagement with literacy and print. Significantly, this engagement was not only focused within and across local communities, it also occasionally reached out to transnational and global networks. To this end, we consider African print cultures in a comparative global framework and critically analyse the usefulness of theoretical tools developed with reference to historical contexts outside of Africa. Michaelmas Term: 2 hour seminar per week x 8 weeksAssessment: Essay, 3–4,000 wordsEmpires in Comparative Perspective (Prof. Saul Dubow)The logic of empire continues to be critical to an understanding of the conditions of life and power which characterised past societies as our own. Recent trans-national and global histories have critiqued imperial histories for their concern with policy, strategy, economy and war and refocused attention on new geographies, agents and ideas. This has had the healthy effect of promoting further scrutiny of the comparative histories of empire, and south-south links in imperial practice. This course interrogates what imperial history means now, by drawing on the exceptional expertise in the Cambridge World History Group. After an introductory session on the conceptual definition of empire, the course will involve classes with two presentations of twenty minutes each by experts on rival and connected empires. These classes may include comparative discussion on: the Portuguese and Spanish empires as early modern European maritime formations; the Ottoman and Russian empires; the modern French and British Empires; the colonisation of Africa and the colonisation of Asia after c.1800; settler colonialism, informal colonialism and company colonialism; contemporary American imperialism and China overseas. The course will thus provide an advanced foray into imperial histories, in their plurality, as to the legacies of post-colonialism and the ground-views from outside the Europe and America which shape their study today. Students will actively participate in a weekly debate between experts, about the writing of imperial histories as they resonate into our present.Lent Term: 2 hour seminar per week x 8 weeksAssessment:  Essay: 3–4,000 wordsIn the words of Hannah Arendt, the ‘Third world’ is not a place but an ideology. This course will examine the place of ideas and ideologies in the making of the global twentieth century. The emphasis of this option will be primarily on ideological innovators from the global South who re-conceptualized the nature of modern politics. Themes will include the critique of colonialism, democracy, violence, internationalism, and radical social change. Figures such as Gandhi, Mao, Castro, Fanon, Khomeini and Mandela will be discussed alongside nationalist ideologues such as Nasser, Nehru, Sukarno, and Nkrumah. The aim will  be to explore the ways in which these figures assimilated but ultimately departed from the universal languages of modern politics ranging from communism and capitalism, to liberalism, humanitarianism and justice. In shifting the focus to the ‘third world’ thinkers or the global south, this course will reconstruct and appraise the radical transformation of world politics.Lent Term: 2 hour seminar per week x 8 weeksAssessment:  Essay: 3–4,000 wordsThis course will explore the history of South Asian migration in modern times. Migration is one of the key forces which has shaped contemporary South Asia and its relations with the wider world. It has had, and continues to have, huge implications for the regions where migrants have settled, for migrants themselves as well as for their descendants, and for the places and the people they have left behind. Diasporas have transformed the social and cultural fabric of the places where migrants have clustered, altering their patterns of consumption and encouraging the emergence of new notions of identity among migrants as well as their Śhostsą. South Asian migrants have frequently sought to intervene in the politics of their homelands, and their Ślong- distanceą patriotisms have often played a crucial role in these politics. The main intellectual currents of twentieth century cannot be understood without an analysis of the contributions of Śintellectuals in exileą. Equally, diasporas everywhere have raised vexed questions of policy, and many governments (not only those in the western world) have responded by making it more and more hard for South Asians to move across borders. The course explores patterns of mobility and circulation within and from early modern South Asia. It considers how the establishment of British imperial control impacted upon old networks of mobility while stimulating new streams, and new forms, of migration. The consequences of partition, which sparked off the largest migrations in recorded history, will be discussed and analysed. ŚPost-colonialą migration has led to the formation of visible and influential communities of South Asians in many parts of the western world, but has also led to ever more systematic efforts to stem further migration, and both processes will be considered. The course will encourage discussion and analysis about the forms of hybrid culture and ŚtransnationaląIndia is often referred to as ‘the world’s largest democracy’ and ‘a model example of how stable democracy works’. However, this elides the numerous and pervasive tensions, fractures, struggles and internal security threats across the country. Historically, both colonial and anti- colonial nationalist narratives tended to ‘collectivise’ experiences in ways which hid the variety of individual experiences of oppression and dissent. Without acknowledging marginal voices, and the creativity and diversity of Indian responses to colonial and postcolonial regimes, hierarchies and power asymmetries, we cannot begin to understand Indian politics, society, and culture.This multidisciplinary course introduces some of the key social and political protest movements of colonial and postcolonial India, and the broader debates surrounding them. Students will critically analyse various strands of dissent in India – from challenges to patriarchy and upper- caste hegemony, to movements against secularism and liberal democracy itself. Many of these narratives of dissent have shaped and re-shaped the very fabric of Indian democracy and mainstream politics; others operate on parallel planes and have simmered beneath the surface. Studying these movements, and their protagonists and methods, require us to rethink the multiple meanings of freedom, of rights, and of democracy for India’s colonial subjects and postcolonial citizens. Has the ‘idea of India’ lost its legitimacy? What might protest and identity movements tell us about the nature, and future, of India’s democracy? The course also encourages students to explore innovative research methodologies and source material to elucidate these topics, including literary sources, autobiographies, oral histories, and visual media.A film and discussion series will run alongside this course to complement the topics, with screenings on Monday evenings, corresponding to that week’s class.    Tweets by @CamWorldHistoryTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

There are over one hundred libraries in the University system, and the University Library itself is one of the finest research libraries in the world.In addition, and of particular interest to World History students, the Centre of South Asian Studies holds more than 40,000 books and issues of journals, many of them published in South Asia. It also holds a unique collection of private papers, films and microfilmed newspapers relating to the history, culture and present condition of South Asia. The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies holds a related collection of articles and printed books. The Centre for African Studies also has its own collection of materials.Graduates also have access to many other faculty libraries, some of them conveniently located on the Sidgwick Site, including Economics, Classics and English. There are also libraries in each of the Colleges and, although these are primarily intended for undergraduate use, some have important holdings of rare books and manuscripts. The Fitzwilliam Museum offers a magnificent array of artefacts as well as manuscript and rare book collections. The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology has a large collection dating back to its origins in the nineteenth century, with particular strengths in the Pacific and Africa. Tweets by @CamWorldHistoryTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The first, British local and regional history, is constant throughout all intakes. The second, which changes for each intake, in 2018-2020 will be Global history. You will specialise in one of these two themes, studying taught modules and undertaking original research, culminating in a dissertation of 16,000 - 20,000 words.The MSt is taught over two years in short, intensive study blocks, and begins in September 2018 (Michaelmas Term). It has been designed to be accessible to those in full- or part-time employment and to international students.Successful applicants will become members of a Cambridge college and will join the wider graduate community, with full access to the facilities of the University.We shall be holding an Open Morning at Madingley Hall specifically for this course on Friday 1 December 2017 from 10.30am-12.30pm. This will be an informal occasion to find out more about the course. You will be able to meet the Course Director Dr Samantha Williams as well as students who have previously taken the course. If you would like to attend, please let Liz Morfoot know (contact details below).By the end of the course students should have:The MSt is structured around four residential modules that students must attend. All students take modules 1 and 3 together; modules 2 and 4 are subject pathway modules. In the first year, each of the four residential blocks is preceded by guided preparatory reading.A Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) offers learning support to students while they are on the programme, including learning resources, peer-to-peer and student-to-tutor discussion between modules, to build a virtual community of practice. Students are expected to have sufficient IT skills to engage with the VLE and all assignments are uploaded to the VLE for assessment.The taught elements of the syllabus are offered during Year 1 in four intensive study blocks which are mostly scheduled inside Full Term, each of which is examined by an assessed essay. Sessions are offered in research training, and essay and dissertation writing. Teaching methods combine informal lectures and class discussion, the study of primary sources, and student-led peer-to-peer learning.British local and regional history includes the study of local communities and regions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Units of analysis might include the family, the street, the neighbourhood, the parish, the town or city, the poor law union, the county, and the wider region. British local and regional history embraces rural and urban history. Local historians use a wide range of methods, but there is an emphasis upon local documentary evidence. Many of the themes of this course can be explored via local history, such as gender, race, religion, class and social status, and culture.Global history combines close, textured area studies of Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Americas and the Middle East with comparative and connected histories that link localities, states and empires to wider narratives of change. This approach, centring global structures and processes but also individuals and local spaces, brings depth and specificity to histories of convergences and divergences. Cambridge has been at the forefront of movements to rethink imperial and colonial impact and legacies, and to trace how concepts such as empire, modernity, nationalism were understood, experienced, and challenged, from the early modern period to the present day.Scholars using a world history approach have focussed not only on a broader geographic frame, but also on rethinking ‘regions’ beyond national borders (‘the Atlantic world’, ‘the Indian ocean’, the Sinophone world), unpacking environmental histories, and studying religions, gender, ideas, sciences and migrations. World historians at Cambridge have contributed to new ‘global intellectual histories’ as well as to new understandings of identity, citizenship, political movements, monarchy and empire. The world history pathway will allow students to gain experience with a wide range of world history research and teaching, from new approaches to Chinese history to rethinking the role of religion in colonial encounters.The induction day includes an introduction to the course and tours of the University and Seeley History libraries. Topics might include the Annales School, international history, gender, feudalism, race, class and social status, nations and states, religion.a) British local and regional historyTopics might include approaches to local history, manors and tour of medieval Cambridge, the parish, early modern culture, religion and belief, urban history, consumption, family and household.ORb) Global historyExact content to be confirmed.Topics might include using library resources and archives, the census, microhistory, sources for early modern history, IT for historians practical, quantitative history, oral history, anthropology and history.a) British local and regional historyPoverty, disease and medicine, 1601-1914: topics might include disease, death and doctors, plague and venereal disease, urban mortality, the Old Poor Law and charity, the New Poor Law, charity and the state, workhouse medicine and mortality, smallpox, childbirth, midwifery and the man-midwife, mutual aid and self-help, the ‘professionalisation’ of medicine.ORb) Global historyExact content to be confirmed.Please note that the content of all modules is indicative and may be subject to change.The second year is characterised by focus on the dissertation. Students will work independently on their chosen topic under the supervision of an expert in their chosen field with whom they will have regular contact. Students will be required to attend five supervisions between May 2019 and May 2020, at least three of which must be face-to-face and two of which can be online.There will also be three day-schools at Madingley Hall, at which students provide short presentations on their research to date and at which there is some research training:Lectures, seminars and classes: c.75 hours in Year 1 (including some reading/prep time), c.18 hours in Year 2.A dissertation of 16,000-20,000 words (including footnotes and appendices, but excluding bibliography).Some assignments and the dissertation require literature reviews. Students are given formal feedback on their assignments and informal feedback throughout their course, including during supervisions. Supervisions also result in an annual progress report at the end of Year 1 and termly reports during Year 2.If you would like academic guidance on your research topic before making an application, please contact the Course Director Dr Samantha Williams at skw30@cam.ac.uk.If you have any questions about the application process, contact our Admissions team: mst.admissions@ice.cam.ac.uk or +44 (0)1223 746262.For all other enquiries, contact the Course Administrator, Dr Liz Morfoot: emm30@cam.ac.uk or +44 (0)1223 746226Applicants for this course will normally have achieved a UK 2.i honours degree or overseas equivalent.There is provision to accept non-standard applicants who do not satisfy the standard academic criterion.

You need to complete this in order to complete the PhD. The maximum of the part-time programme is 21 terms (i.e. seven years). Myth buster: does a part-time PhD mean I don’t get the ‘Cambridge experience’?Not at all! You will still be a member of a college and therefore be able to experience the collegiate system.Your supervisor is appointed in exactly the same way and serves exactly the same purpose.You will still have an interview in the admissions process.You still have an RAE (Registration Assessment Exercise) but this is usually held during your fifth or sixth term (different timing to the full-time PhD).You still have access to the training and teaching within the Faculty. In order for you to gain the most benefit, we ask that you live within a reasonable distance so as to be able to attend Cambridge regularly. The part-time PhD is a not a distance-learning degree.The total University Composition Fee for the degree is the same, whether full-time or part-time. In practice, this means that 60% of the full-time fee is charged for each term of registration as a part-time student. College fees are charged on the same basis.  What is different for a part-time PhD?On the application form, there is a box which needs to be ticked by applicants wishing to pursue a part-time degree. You will then need to provide a statement saying why you need to study part-time instead of full-time.You can continue to be in employment with the part-time PhD, although full-time employment is not considered compatible with the degree. You provide a letter from your employer stating that you will be allowed the time off work to attend the University as required for the duration of your course.AHRC and ESRC fund part-time students, but part-time awards provide only 50% of the full-time rate of tuition fees. Be aware of this as the University charges part-time students 60% of the full-time rate, therefore the difference will need to be made up.You have an annual progress paper where, at the end of each calendar year, you meet with your supervisor to consider a brief but formal progress paper prepared by the student.  How is the part-time PhD examined?It is examined in exactly the same way as the full-time PhD is examined. Here is a table of the different termly requirements: QUALIFICATIONTERM (1 being your first term)Minimum number of terms of research needed before submittingPart-time PhD15Minimum number of terms of research which need to be in Cambridge (in order to qualify for the PhD)Part-time PhD5End of term by which your draft dissertation must be submitted to your supervisorPart-time PhD16Absolute final submission deadlinePart-time PhD21Maximum number of terms for which an exemption or allowance will be made following a one-year coursePart-time PhD5  Can I request early submission?Where exemption is sought for a previous qualification, the maximum number of terms for which exemption can be allowed is five terms, part-time.You apply for an exemption when you are near completion and know how many terms of research are required to complete the work. Early submission from part-time students who have no grounds for an exemption (e.g. previous qualification), but have been able to devote more time than expected is usually not permitted unless the full fee for a five-year minimum research period has been paid. What about transferring to full-time status?This is certainly possible, but don’t enter into it lightly – you can only do this once only in either direction e.g. move once from full-time to part-time, or move once from part-time to full-time.This application is submitted to the Degree Committee and is considered on a case-by-case basis – if your circumstances change then this is an option. Intellectual Property RightsIf you are employed then arrangements for intellectual property rights must be agreed in advance. Please make sure your employer reads this section.If the employer is not asserting any rights in the intellectual property created in the course of the research, a statement to this effect must be provided in writing within the application. Generally, this is expected to be the case where the employer is neither paying for the time of study nor contributing to fees. In the absence of any claim on the intellectual property by the employer, the position on intellectual property is identical to that of a full-time PhD student. More information on this is available on the Student Registry website.If the employer is claiming rights in the intellectual property, the applicant and the employer must sign a short agreement which, among other things, confirms the level of any sponsorship by the employer and also sets out the position on intellectual property. This is administered through the University’s Research Services Division (16 Mill Lane, Cambridge. CB2 1SB).While the employer may wish to retain ownership in any intellectual property created by the student, the University will also want to ensure that regard is given to the intellectual property rights in any contributions from the Supervisor or other members of the University, as well as its obligations to external sponsors.The University will also wish to make sure that the employer cannot restrict the use or exploitation of the student’s share in any collaborative project in which the student takes part. Part-time Co-ordinatorDr Paul Warde is currently the Faculty’s Co-ordinator of the part-time PhD. He is available to offer administrative advice to applicants – find him in the Academic Staff Directory here: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-paul-warde  Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is the Registration Assessment Exercise, which is held between the student, the supervisor, and an Advisor (we appoint them for you). You submit work and then have a meeting to discuss what you have submitted, in order to check that you are on track and help you continue to frame your research.  This exercise should take place in the third term of study. Once registered by the Faculty Degree Committee, you are a registered PhD student; up until this point, you are a NOTAF, which means ‘not at first registered’.The piece of work you submit for the RAE is likely to be surveying your field of research, summarising progress so far, proposing a research strategy and timetable, and indicating the original contribution to knowledge that is intended.Although it might sound like a scary process, this is your chance to shine and show off how much work you have done during your first year and how your research is coming along! It’s also a chance to discuss any problems, issues, or worries you may have with your research in a formal setting, though you will have ample opportunity to do this with your supervisor before the third term RAE.                      How am I trained in research while at Cambridge?Often, you will be starting the PhD course with a background of suitable research training which you undertook before admission, e.g. your Masters or MPhil degree. While you are at Cambridge, you can broaden this as much as you wish with the number of different opportunities available.You may find it useful to consult our current Graduate Training pages: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/graduate-students/training You may also like to browse the Graduate Training Handbook: **COMING SOON**These show what the Faculty has to offer in-house with Graduate Training.There are also plenty of other options within the University, for example other Departments and Faculties, as well as University-wide seminars, workshops, and conferences held throughout the year. There is a fantastic Language Centre: http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/lc/index.html as well as a specialist training system: http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/cppd/.This is before we’ve even started on what may be offered through your particular college!Your supervisor is an excellent resource to use in terms of asking what is available and if there is anything which would suit you. They will be happy to help!             What happens in the final year of the PhD?We actively encourage all of our full-time students to complete their PhDs within three years.In order to help you stay on track, we ask that every full-time candidate undergo an assessment exercise in the Lent Term of their third year of research. You submit a one- to two-page synopsis of your dissertation together with a timetable for completion. You then have a formal discussion with your supervisor, and sometimes the Advisor.The major government grant-giving bodies expect all our full-time students to complete within a maximum of four years. Therefore, in order to secure future funding for its students, the Degree Committee monitors its submissions rates closely. This is why we place emphasis on your research proposal being something feasible for completion in three years, and also why we have the first and third year assessments in order to help you as much as we can.The fourth year isn’t guaranteed, so do try to plan your topic within a three-year time span. By that time, we hope you’ll be eager to get started on your career after the training you will have received at Cambridge! How is the PhD examined?Once you have submitted a full dissertation, it is examined by two examiners. These examiners are appointed by the Degree Committee after consultation with your supervisor. You will then have a viva voce – an oral examination – on the dissertation and the general field of your knowledge into which your dissertation falls. The University of Cambridge does not offer any qualifying grades or credits, so you will be awarded a pass or a fail – we hope it’s the former!Here’s a table which outlines, for full-time candidates, the registration and submission dates: QUALIFICATIONTERM (1 being your first term)Minimum number of terms of research needed before submittingPhD9Minimum number of terms of research which need to be in Cambridge (in order to qualify for the PhD)PhD3End of term by which your draft dissertation must be submitted to your supervisorPhD10Absolute final submission deadlinePhD12Maximum number of terms for which an exemption or allowance will be made following a one-year coursePhD3Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Please do feel free to read the information on the full-time PhD as well, as much of it will still pertain to the part-time PhD. How is the PhD taught?It is taught by individual supervision – you can read more about this here: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/prospective-graduates/courses/phd-fulltime/phd-fulltime-probateThere are lots of opportunities on offer: you can gain instruction in specialist disciplines, such as palaeography, languages, and computing; you can undertake training in professional skills appropriate for historians; you will be able to attend research seminars and workshops, and lots more. There is also now training available in transferable skills, such as communication, self-awareness and team-building. Although you will be focusing on your own research for most of your time, we want to help you to become a well-rounded and successful PhD candidate.  What are we looking for?We see the primary purpose of the PhD being the preparation and presentation of a substantial piece of original research. From the very beginning of the PhD course, the student focuses on the writing of the doctoral dissertation. History is a broad subject which covers many areas, and we are always very excited to see the sheer range of research proposals submitted. When looking at this, we consider:If a research proposal is likely to take significantly longer than three years to complete, we don’t tend to accept it. However, if your topic seems feasible within the time-frame then we will be very interested!  Are there any course requirements?Please also see the ‘Requirements’ tab in the prospectus on Graduate Admissions page: http://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/hihipdhis/requirementsFor full-time PhD candidates, we require that you pursue supervised research in residence in Cambridge for nine consecutive terms (three calendar years). ‘In residence’ means living within a distance of 10 miles from the centre of Cambridge.The dissertation must be submitted by the end of the twelfth term, earlier if possible.In terms of applicant requirements, you can see our language and academic requirements on the link provided above. Otherwise, we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply – we are a multicultural university and in your life as a PhD candidate, you will meet people from all over the world! The PhD is intellectually demanding so consider whether you have the self-motivation to pursue research at a high level of scholarship, and whether you have the enthusiasm to keep going when the going gets tough. You will not be alone in your studies, though – there are plenty of people here to help, including supervisors, administrators, college tutors, as well as many others.PhD students are expected to begin their studies at the start of the term they choose to enter, usually October, January, or April. You will be in residence continuously throughout the year, apart from short breaks for research.As the full-time PhD requires full-time study, we ask that students do not take any outside employment (even part-time employment).Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

I have seen him approx every 3 – 4 weeks and he has been very conscientious: always reading my work and responding to my queries /problems very quickly. He has been an enormous source of guidance, encouragement and support. We have worked well together, setting deadlines that I have always reached and helping to advise on planning work."Every graduate student undertaking a PhD in History at Cambridge is assigned a supervisor. They are someone who has an interest in the same area of research as you, and their role is to guide your programme of study and research while helping you to identify your own specialist and generic training needs.Supervisors are there to help and are often extremely approachable. Be confident in saying that you would like to discuss a particular topic, or ask them questions about where you need to go next or what training would most benefit you. However, PhD students in History are expected to work largely on their own initiative – supervisors won’t do it all for you! As long as you are prepared to listen to your supervisor’s advice and be proactive in discussion with them, we hope that you will realise a fruitful working relationship with someone of similar interests.  How do you allocate a supervisor?All PhD students must have a supervisor and it is our responsibility to find one which we think suits you best. We have a wide range of academic staff here and you are welcome to browse our Academic Staff Directory: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/academic-staff. If you so wish, you can contact particular academics to discuss your application. Obviously, they cannot guarantee you a place, but most of them will be willing to talk about a possible research proposal and whether you are suited to study at Cambridge.When you apply, you can suggest a possible supervisor on the application form. This is helpful if you’ve already been in touch with someone, as above, and would like to work with them. It doesn’t mean that you will definitely get that particular supervisor, but it helps us know who you would like to work with.Don’t worry though if you can’t find anyone! If you don’t fill in the optional ‘prospective supervisor’ box, then we do the work for you. We know our department well, so we will send on your application for consideration to whoever we think is best.Sometimes, applications go through multiple supervisors before someone is found. This can be because academics are already full with PhD students, will be on leave or retiring soon, or think someone else suits your proposed subject better. If no one can be found then, unfortunately, we cannot accept your application. However, rest assured that we do all we can to get you supervisory cover!   Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

As well as having a long-established expertise in British and European history, Cambridge has particular strengths in Extra-European History. While some of the most famous Cambridge historians have focused on political and constitutional history, the Faculty has also played a central role in the development of the history of political thought and in the flourishing fields of economic, social and cultural history. Its members include specialists in business and religious history and in the history of population, the family and gender.Much of the work in these fields is done in collaboration with other Faculties from across the University including African Studies, Divinity and Politics and International Studies. The Faculty recruits outstanding graduate students from all backgrounds across the entire range of the discipline of History. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

The idea for the new Spacefinder website arose from research into study practice conducted by the University Library which revealed that students are often unable to find suitable study environments and can be bewildered by the number of options open to them. Whether a person wants to work alone or in a group, silently or with background noise, in a modern or historic library, Spacefinder will show them matching spaces nearby.However, the service is not only limited to libraries – the research revealed that students enjoy a wider study landscape and that many prefer to work outside of libraries in coffee shops or common areas.  This is why Spacefinder helps students locate these spaces too, thereby supporting students whatever their particular needs.The service can be searched by study preferences, keyword or by navigating a map of Cambridge. Images of the spaces help the searcher decide whether the space is for them, as does information on the facilities they can expect to find there, such as WiFi, phone signal, large desks, catering facilities and natural daylight.Spacefinder is part of the University Library’s Futurelib programme which seeks to deliver innovative new services across Cambridge University libraries. Project Manager Andy Priestner commented: ‘It’s exciting to see the fruits of our labours in the form of Spacefinder and I’m very grateful to all the librarians who contributed space information and helped make this service a reality.’Spacefinder will be promoted to students at the Freshers’ Fair, library inductions and via social media and there are high hopes that the pilot service proves to be a valuable part of the Cambridge student experience.Spacefinder can be accessed at: spacefinder.lib.cam.ac.ukTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

Full-time nursery care for pre-school children can cost upwards of £10,000 per child per year, and after-school clubs for children of school age cost up to £2,000 per child per year. Don't worry though, we do try to help! Cambridge University offers a range of College, co-operative and private facilities to support students with their childcare arrangements and associated costs which are detailed on the University's Childcare Office website.If you plan to bring dependants or children to Cambridge, remember to factor this into the costs involved. If you are made an offer of admission to the University, the financial condition specified in your offer letter will take account of your statement about accompanying dependants in the Graduate Application Form. These costs are set in accordance with the figures outlined on the Graduate Admissions Office maintenance calculator.Scholarships do not usually provide maintenance for dependants. We ask that you provide evidence of the extra financial support required and also the consent of your college before you bring dependants or children with you to Cambridge. If you bring children or dependants, we're sure that they'll enjoy being here in Cambridge just as much as you!SaveTweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

It does so flexibly in accordance with the needs of its users; it uses IT to underpin its operations and its activities are informed by relevant research in second language acquisition and educational technology.Many of our students choose to study a language during their time at the University, and for some of the MPhils it is a compulsory element.The Language Centre ADTIS programme provides a range of courses and support programmes in English. These programmes are designed and focused on helping students to improve both their English language and their academic skills during their time at Cambridge.Students will be able to enrol directly with the Language Centre. Courses will be advertised from the middle of September and places are limited so it's important to book as soon as possible if students wish to take the courses, particularly for Academic Reading courses which are generally oversubscribed. If you need any advice on this please e-mail us.Detailed description of all courses (all languages and levels) offered can be found online at http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/lc/culp/culp-general-courses.htmlAvailable classes (including all timeslots for Michaelmas/Lent courses) and booking information can be found online at http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/lc/theme/CULPWhere language training is a compulsory element of an MPhil Programme, this cost will be covered by the Faculty.Students are also encouraged to approach their College, who may have funding available for such training. Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences PhD students only can apply for a bursary to cover the costs a CULP course or attendance at other fee charging courses offered within the University or externally.

They are someone who has an interest in the same area of research as you, and their role is to guide your programme of study and research while helping you to identify your own specialist and generic training needs.Supervisors are there to help and are often extremely approachable. Be confident in saying that you would like to discuss a particular topic, or ask them questions about where you need to go next or what training would most benefit you. However, graduate students in History are expected to work largely on their own initiative – supervisors won’t do it all for you! As long as you are prepared to listen to your supervisor’s advice and be proactive in discussion with them, we hope that you will realise a fruitful working relationship with someone of similar interests. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

As well as having a long-established expertise in British and European history, Cambridge has particular strengths in Extra-European History. While some of the most famous Cambridge historians have focused on political and constitutional history, the Faculty has also played a central role in the development of the history of political thought and in the flourishing fields of economic, social and cultural history. Its members include specialists in business and religious history and in the history of population, the family and gender.Much of the work in these fields is done in collaboration with other Faculties from across the University including African Studies, Divinity and Politics and International Studies. The Faculty recruits outstanding graduate students from all backgrounds across the entire range of the discipline of History. Tweets by @CamHistory© 2017 University of Cambridge

You are likely to be a serious candidate.We welcome and encourage applications from talented students from every educational and social background and would be delighted to hear from you. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you need more information.Applicants should find the following information useful:All Cambridge Colleges have an Admissions Office that you can contact, and we also have a central Cambridge Admissions Office; details of these can be accessed by clicking here.© 2017 University of Cambridge

web browser if you wish but then our site may not work correctly.Faculty of HistoryStudying at CambridgeGeneral information about applying to Cambridge can be found via the University’s Undergraduate Admissions website.To this we would like to add answers to a number of commonly posed questions.What are we particularly looking for in History applicants?As with all courses, we aim to admit 'the best and brightest'. In the case of History, this means those who have the intellectual and academic ability to do really well at Cambridge, and who pair this with genuine interest in the subject.How can we tell if someone is genuinely interested?There are many ways of demonstrating an interest in the subject, but undoubtedly the most important is through showing evidence of further reading in your spare time, whether this is related to the history you study at school or not. We hope you will tell us about the history you have studied and read, and what you thought of it, in your UCAS personal statement and, in most cases, at interview.How much of your personal statement should you devote to history?There are no hard and fast rules, but the UCAS personal statement allows you an opportunity to tell us what you find most interesting about your chosen subject, and why you want to continue to study it at university. So we often use the personal statement as a starting point for discussion at interview. Most really effective personal statements are at least two-thirds subject-focused.Apart from evidence of interest in history, what else do we look for in a personal statement?What are we looking for in submitted work?We know that many of you will have completed few essays by the time you apply, and so we try to be flexible when we ask for school or college work. You don't need to write something especially. It's a good idea to send in something you enjoyed writing and would be happy to discuss at interview. (Take a copy before you send it!) When we read these essays, we are looking for evidence of good written English, factual accuracy, structure, and full and effective analysis and argument.Is there a written test?A number of Colleges have been piloting a common-form written test taken at time of interview. But this is a relatively informal thing and essentially provides additional written material to be considered alongside the submitted essays, and in a similar way.What will we all talk about at interview?History. This encompasses the history you have studied in the last year or so, your submitted essays, any history you have told us about in your personal statement and anything you have read. You may also be asked to read an unseen passage of primary or secondary material before one of your interviews, and then talk about it in the interview. You'll be asked interesting, challenging questions that you will have to think hard about, but which, in most cases, you will find do-able. Interviews are essentially an interactive historical aptitude-test in the form of a discussion. Your job is to listen carefully to the questions, have a bash, and try to enjoy it.How should you prepare?Will you still get in if you have a 'bad' interview?Potentially.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Indeed, almost all Cambridge History students seeking employment have secured excellent and well-paid jobs within just a few months of graduating.What sorts of careers do historians enter?They go into a very wide range of professions. The most popular of these are currently law, business and finance,national and local government, non-governmental organisations (both national and international), journalism and publishing, teaching, library and museum work, and research-based careers of all kinds.One of our students did his third-year dissertation on J F Kennedy and the Civil Rights movement. Now he reports from Washington for BBC TV news. Another did hers on Virginia Crawford, a Victorian feminist. She is working as a child psychologist in a North London NHS Trust hospital.Here is what just a few of our graduates had to say about how History has been useful to them in their careers: “I came to History knowing that I wanted to be a journalist. While I toyed with the idea of doing a career-specific degree, I ended up thinking that I would be far better served studying a subject I truly enjoyed which would give me an area of expertise that I could draw on in the years to come. I never for a moment doubted that my degree would be worthwhile. I was confident that a degree from Cambridge would always be worth a great deal because, for many people, it represents the highest level of academic achievement. History is particularly well suited to journalism because many of the research skills are the same. A familiarity with libraries and computer archives is incredibly useful, as is the ability to sift through, analyse and organise material into a coherent argument. I learned an enormous amount about writing newspaper articles from constructing my history essays. I was also encouraged to develop original ideas and to defend them when challenged - again, a very useful skill in a career that relies largely on fluency and eloquence. History, like journalism, teaches you that clarity is all. But there is also a more intangible benefit in that it teaches you about human nature and cycles of behaviour. It gives you a context for understanding current events and appreciating the world around you. It heightens your perception about people and their motivations.” "Reading History at Cambridge gave me the confidence to go into a classroom and teach. The vast choice of papers meant that I could look at areas I was particularly interested in while also developing the skills to approach an unknown period. Most importantly it has made me challenge the way I see the world." "When I studied History at Cambridge I didn't think I'd end up as a partner in a major City law firm like Freshfields. But that's what happened, and I found that I wasn't alone in my firm in having taken up law after studying history as a degree subject. Now, I'm in charge of recruiting students to train with us, and we are still finding plenty of compelling candidates who come from a history background. Lawyers need to assimilate information and put forward arguments, and that's just what history students learn to do. My advice to anyone would be: if you are interested enough, go for it!"How much can History graduates earn?Obviously this depends on the type of job they do. As an example, typical starting-salaries for our students entering careers in law, business and finance are in the range £28,000-£35,000 p.a., rising to circa £35,000-£50,000 in the second andthird years of work.Do many people go on to do further research?Around 40% of Cambridge History graduates go on to complete, at some point, a further degree: sometimes a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) but more commonly a History Masters or Ph.D. While with us, they've got the history bug good and proper! Some of them progress in due course to careers as academic or popular historians.Want to find out more?If you would like to learn more about the career paths taken by historians from a range of UK universities, you will find useful information on the Prospects UK site. Cambridge University Careers Service also has information pages for school and college students considering applying to Cambridge.© 2017 University of Cambridge

In fact, you will have the opportunity to investigate practically any period or aspect of history that interests you. At the same time, our course has clear, tightly focused, objectives. It will equip you with a broad range of historical knowledge and understanding. It will teach you to evaluate critically the significance and usefulness of primary and secondary material. It aims to instil in you the confidence to undertake self-directed learning – in other words, to define your own questions, and to go about answering them using the analytical and research skills you have picked up. And it emphasises the importance of assembling, organising and presenting your ideas clearly and coherently. Studying history will provide you with a multifaceted insight into human experience and help you to make sense of a complex, globalising world. There is no such thing as an ‘identikit historian’ and so there is no simple answer to this question. Apart from history, you do not need any particular subjects at A' level. A foreign language is certainly useful but not necessary. However, you should enjoy making analytical judgements, be able to think laterally, discriminate critically, enjoy reading, and have a burning curiosity about the past.If you are a mature student, go here for more information about requirements for study at Cambridge:One of our professors has recently been awarded a knighthood for his work on German history. Another has recently completed a biography of the early medieval emperor, Charlemagne, while three of our colleagues have put together a groundbreaking exhibition on changing fashion trends from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment. You may well be taught by any or all of these people. Cambridge prides itself on being a teaching university, and none of the academics who work here is considered as being ‘too exalted to teach’. So the Faculty’s major resource is this international body of experts, numbering about 90. We continue to achieve top ratings in research assessments of university history departments in the UK and outstanding teaching ratings in surveys by the UK national press.Our other great strength is the Seeley Library, one of the largest student libraries dedicated to history in the world, recently rewired for full internet access. Nearby is the University Library, which is unique among copyright libraries in storing most of its volumes on open shelves, available to undergraduates. In short, finding the right book is rarely a problem.There are other benefits to studying here. Undergraduate historians are encouraged to embark or brush up on foreign languages, and have access to both the University Language Centre and specialist language teaching. And most Colleges have travel grants for students who wish to study the history of another country or who are doing research for their dissertation.Teaching is spread between the Faculty and the Colleges. The Faculty devises the options, sets the examinations and provides lectures to cover course content. On average, you attend eight to ten lectures each week. Themes and Sources, in Part I, and Special Subjects, in Part II, are taught through Faculty classes. The Colleges arrange supervisions for the other papers in Parts I and II and this gives you the opportunity to engage in intense debates with senior historians. These weekly one-hour discussions are the focal point of your academic week and the core of the History course. You write an essay for an expert supervisor, who then discusses it with you either individually or in a small group. This system of teaching ensures that you get plenty of guidance, support and feedback. All Colleges are experienced in organising specialist teaching across the full range of historical topics.At appropriate points, there are Faculty lectures and College classes on general historical issues. You will also have opportunities for informal interaction with frontline historians at College history society meetings and in the Faculty.Our History course gives you the opportunity to look at the past through many disciplinary lenses – including political, economic, social, cultural and intellectual – and to explore how history has learnt from other disciplines like anthropology, literature and archaeology. Some course options are shared with other departments, such as Politics and International Relations, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, Classics, Modern and Medieval Languages and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.History is unusual among Cambridge subjects in not setting a classed first-year examination but most history undergraduates sit a Preliminary Examination towards the end of their first year. This does not count towards your final degree but aims to give you an informal sense of your achievement to that point. The basic difference between Parts I and II is that Part I concentrates on breadth of historical understanding and Part II on depth. Throughout the course there is ample scope for you to pursue your personal interests and experiment with different historical approaches. Specialist papers allow you to work with a variety of source materials: in the past few years, these have included music, art, cartoons, other visual images, and coins. At the end of Part I, students sit five three-hour written papers; one-year Part II students also take five papers (unless they write a dissertation). The Part I Themes and Sources Long Essay and a Part II Long Essay and Dissertation ensure that you have the opportunity to be assessed on work done outside the examination room.It is possible in certain circumstances to transfer to a different Tripos after Part I, although the flexibility of the History Tripos, and the fact that some Part II options are shared with faculties such as Human, Social and Political Sciences (HSPS) and Classics, mean that very few students opt to do so.  A very small number of students each year take a two-year Part II in History, having completed Part I in another subject, such as English or Economics. Typical A level offer A*AA  A' level History normally required.Pre-interview written assessment for all applicants.See Course entry in Cambridge prospectus for more information© 2017 University of Cambridge

Themes and Sources, in Part I, and Special Subjects, in Part II, are taught through Faculty classes. The Colleges arrange supervisions for the other papers in Parts I and II and this gives you the opportunity to engage in intense debates with senior historians. These weekly one-hour discussions are the focal point of your academic week and the core of the History course. You write an essay for an expert supervisor, who then discusses it with you either individually or in a small group. This system of teaching ensures that you get plenty of guidance, support and feedback. All Colleges are experienced in organising specialist teaching across the full range of historical topics.At appropriate points, there are Faculty lectures and College classes on general historical issues. You will also have opportunities for informal interaction with frontline historians at College history society meetings and in the Faculty.Our History course gives you the opportunity to look at the past through many disciplinary lenses – including political, economic, social, cultural and intellectual – and to explore how history has learnt from other disciplines like anthropology, literature and archaeology. Some course options are shared with other departments, such as Politics and International Relations, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, Classics, Modern and Medieval Languages and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.History is unusual among Cambridge subjects in not setting a classed first-year examination but most history undergraduates sit a Preliminary Examination towards the end of their first year. This does not count towards your final degree but aims to give you an informal sense of your achievement to that point. The basic difference between Parts I and II is that Part I concentrates on breadth of historical understanding and Part II on depth. Throughout the course there is ample scope for you to pursue your personal interests and experiment with different historical approaches. Specialist papers allow you to work with a variety of source materials: in the past few years, these have included music, art, cartoons, other visual images, and coins. At the end of Part I, students sit five three-hour written papers; one-year Part II students also take five papers (unless they write a dissertation). The Part I Themes and Sources Long Essay and a Part II Long Essay and Dissertation ensure that you have the opportunity to be assessed on work done outside the examination room.It is possible in certain circumstances to transfer to a different Tripos after Part I, although the flexibility of the History Tripos, and the fact that some Part II options are shared with faculties such as Human, Social and Political Sciences (HSPS) and Classics, mean that very few students opt to do so.  A very small number of students each year take a two-year Part II in History, having completed Part I in another subject, such as English or Economics. Typical A level offer A*AA  A' level History normally required.Pre-interview written assessment for all applicants.See Course entry in Cambridge prospectus for more information© 2017 University of Cambridge

These involve online and personal language teaching to prepare students to study primary sources in the original and to use them in their examined work.  French and German options are currently offered. Undergraduates who wish to extend their linguistic expertise may also do so in various other ways, for instance by enrolling at the University Language Centre. Through the Cambridge University Language Programme, the Language Centre offers beginners, intermediate and advanced courses focused on the acquisition of conversational skills and key grammatical knowledge in a wide range of languages, from French, German and Spanish to Hindi, Mandarin, Swahili and Brazilian Portuguese. All students receive a Certificate of Proficiency on completion of their studies. Those wishing to undertake more in-depth language studies, alongside History, should consider applying for the new History and Modern Languages joint degree pathway.© 2017 University of Cambridge

It was first established in 1807 when John Symonds, Regius Professor of Modern History, gathered its nucleus of 1,000 volumes; in 1895 it was named in honour of one of his most distinguished successors, Sir John Seeley.As part of the internationally-renowned History Faculty building, designed by James Stirling, the library now seats over three hundred readers and holds over 90,000 printed volumes for reference or loan (graduates and third-year students can also borrow from the University Library).AcclimatisationAll new students are offered tours and talks on how to make best use of the library facilities on offer here and elsewhere in the University. The online Seeley guide gives further details of our very extensive collections, the online catalogue (Newton), opening hours, contact details and useful links. There are always staff on duty ready to help in locating the right information or items.The CollectionThe Seeley collection reflects the faculty's very diverse range of research and teaching interests as they have evolved over the years.  Covering almost every era, region and type of history, from political and intellectual topics through ancient, medieval, European and extra-European studies, the library acquires copies of most of the printed material recommended by subject specialists through very comprehensive reading lists.  You will find most of the reading for your essays and dissertations is available here in printed or online form.In addition to a traditional-style loan collection the Library offers constantly up-dated access to hundreds of Electronic Resources, networked through the University Library.The Seeley houses 27 computer workstations which can be used to research and download material, write essays and print them, and also offers wireless network access for those who would prefer to bring a laptop or netbook.DVDs of films, documentaries and even operas now form core resources for many undergraduate courses and the Seeley holds copies that can be borrowed to view in college or at home, or to be viewed in our large Audio-Visual Room.© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is not classed, and does not count towards Part I. It is intended to provide candidates with informal guidance about their progress to date. Candidates sit an examination in the first two of the Part I outline papers that they have studied. Part I and Part II examinations are held in late May and early June. Each element of the assessment process has equal weighting.Your five Part I Papers will be examined through a three-hour examination, in which you answer three essay questions. Your Themes & Sources option, taken in your first year, will be examined through a 3-5,000 word 'Long Essay'. Written over the summer between your first and second years, this is submitted in Lent Term of your second year. In Part II, you take a Special Subject, for which you submit a 6-8,000 word 'Long Essay' on a topic chosen from a list. Written over the Easter Vacation in your third year, this is submitted at the beginning of Easter Term. You will also sit a three-hour 'gobbets' paper, in which you will be asked to comment on some of the primary sources you have studied over the course of the year. Historical Argument and Practice is a compulsory paper for Part II, assessed by a 3-hour written examination in which you will answer one question.Depending on whether you have opted to submit a 10-15,000 word dissertation, you are also examined in either one or two Specified Subjects through a three-hour examination, in which you answer three essay questions.The research for a dissertation is typically conducted over the summer between your second and third years, and the writing in Michaelmas of your third year. The dissertation is submitted in the Easter Term of your third year. Your Part II results alone determine the class of degree that you are awarded at the end of your course.  © 2017 University of Cambridge

The Faculty devises the courses, sets the examinations and provides lectures to cover course content. These lectures are available to everyone, on an annual cycle. The colleges arrange supervisions for the courses; these are weekly one-hour discussions for which each student writes an essay. There are also group discussions in Faculty and college classes.There are three major strengths of this system:We are able to offer such a broad range of modules thanks to the size and varied interests of our teaching staff. There are over fifty permanent lecturing staff in the Faculty, and they work alongside many college teaching and research Fellows and several notable visiting scholars from abroad. A list of Faculty and college lecturing staff can be found here. The Faculty has an internationally distinguished reputation for research; it has been awarded the highest possible ratings in all the Research Assessment Exercises conducted to date by university funding bodies. It also possesses an 'Excellent' rating for its teaching, awarded by the Higher Education Funding Council of England's Quality Assessment team. All Faculty staff teach undergraduates, and the purpose of the many classes and seminars organised in and around the Faculty is to allow students to engage in discussion with senior historians as intellectual equals.© 2017 University of Cambridge

This exciting new four-year Honours degree, offered jointly by the Faculty of Modern & Medieval Languages and the Faculty of History, encompasses intensive study in language, culture, film, as well as a wide variety of British, European and world history. Like other language students, you spend the third year abroad – studying or working in a foreign country, and immersing yourself in the language, culture and history. History courses allow you to develop critical skills in analysis, research, presentation, and writing.When you graduate, you’ll have near native-speaker skills in your language and a deep knowledge and understanding of the regions in which that language is used. You’ll also have a deep immersion in the discipline and craft of history and a deep understanding of the many forces that have shaped the past and present.The course lasts four years and is split into three Parts: Part IA in the first year, Part IB in the second year, and Part II in years three and four.Details of the structure of the course can be found here.Graduates will possess skills that will appeal to a wide range of employers. You'll have gained written and verbal fluency in a second language and experience of living abroad; which are highly sought-after transferrable skills. You will possess a wide-ranging knowledge of history, European and beyond, as well as a range of skills in reading critically, dealing with information, working independently and with others, and speaking and writing with clarity. Note on applications: Students applying for joint honours courses may be offered places for single honours courses after interview.     See the course entry in the prospectus        What is Cambridge like?© 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of HistoryStudying at CambridgeHistory and Politics at Cambridge is an exciting new joint Honours degree which will run for the first time in 2017. It offers subjects from our highly regarded History and Politics and International Relations courses, together with bespoke papers which will allow students to explore the space between the two disciplines. Cambridge is uniquely placed to teach History and Politics and International Relations together. Staff in the Faculty of History and the Department of Politics and International Studies have a wide range of shared interests in political and international history, the origins of contemporary politics and international relations, and the history of political thought. This new degree balances a strong grounding in the two component subjects with the chance to explore the ways in which historical and political understanding together illuminate the modern world.One of the strengths of the History and Politics degree at Cambridge is the quality of the teaching: you will have the opportunity to learn from some of the most eminent academics in the field. The degree is taught through a mixture of departmental lectures, seminars and classes, and college ‘supervisions’, in which students discuss their essays with a supervisor individually or in very small groups. Supervisions provide a wonderful opportunity for students to receive individual feedback on their work and to discuss the problems and ideas raised by the lectures and further reading. Students take four papers in each year, and normally write seven to eight supervision essays for each paper. In the first year, you can typically expect between eight and ten hours of lectures and classes a week, along with one or two supervisions.The first year provides a core grounding in historical knowledge, intellectual history, political science and international relations. The second year offers more specialised papers in the history of political thought, international relations, comparative politics, and European and global history.

There is no need to work through all of the exercises and lectures on offer here, and we certainly don't expect this of applicants to Cambridge. The main aim of the Virtual Classroom is to help you develop your interests and skills as a historian, and you should look at the exercises and lectures you feel will help you most. That said, don't be afraid to tackle a subject you haven't studied before; many of our undergraduates find that the papers they enjoy most are on time periods or parts of the world about which they knew next to nothing before arriving at Cambridge! It's for this reason that we have deliberately tried to give you a flavour of periods and places which are often not found on the school syllabus, as well as of things which are. And please don't worry if you find some of the questions in our Source Exercises and Secondary Literature Exercises difficult. They are meant to be challenging, and we certainly don't expect you to know all the answers straight away; we have created the exercises to help you develop your skills. To assist you, we always explain answers on the next page.© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is important, therefore, to be aware that historical writing works on at least two levels:a) an outline of what happened – the 'facts' or 'the story'b) an interpretation of those facts – the historian's opinionThis does not mean, however, that these two aspects are clearly divided in the text, nor that those parts which fall into a) are somehow factual or neutral: remember that the very language in which a) is expressed is itself a reflection of the interpretation in b). For example, a historian might write an apparently straightforward 'factual' statement:However, even this carries its own interpretation. Firstly, it assumes we all agree on what we mean by 'battle'. But do we? Compared with later conflicts, the Battle of Hastings was small in scale, lasted a day and was fought over a tiny area compared with, say, the Battle of the Somme, fought over a period of four months in 1916 and covering a large area of northern France. The 'Battle of Hastings' did not take place in the streets of Hastings, nor was it a siege of the town: it was fought on a hill some five miles away: today there is a separate town on the site, called Battle. The conflict could be more accurately termed 'a major skirmish in Sussex'. The date 1066 is written in the widely used Christian calendar; other calendar systems, such as the Jewish or Islamic, would date it differently.We can take this example a step further. Why is this date and event so familiar, even to people who know and care little about history? The answer lies in the Whig interpretation of English history, which was widely believed in through the nineteenth, and well into the twentieth, century. According to this school of thought, 1066 marked the destruction of a golden age of law and liberty in Anglo-Saxon England and the imposition of what was called the 'Norman yoke'. The Whigs held that English history was the story of a long struggle to regain the supposed liberties that had existed before 1066. For that reason the date was drummed into schoolchildren, helped by the easy rhythm with which it trips off the tongue, embedding itself so firmly in the national consciousness that it survived even the radical changes in history teaching of the late twentieth century, which saw other familiar dates and events disappear from the nation's classrooms and memories.Thus, the language of 'The Battle of Hastings took place in 1066'; the fact that it comes so readily to mind as an example of an apparently straightforward statement; and the fact that you, the reader, are very likely to know at least in outline what it refers, all show that this particular historical statement carries much more meaning and significance than might at first appear. What goes for that statement applies even more so to full historical works.The extracts in this section will enable you to see this complexity of meaning in a selection of historical works stretching from Roman times to the modern day. You don't have to know anything about the periods they are written about, nor about the times when they were written. You will find that different historians have had very different ideas of what 'writing history' entails.Secondary Source Exercises >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

In other words, what kind of source do we have here? If it is a written document, is it a personal recollection or an official report, a travel narrative or an historical account, a fictional reconstruction or a newspaper article striving for factual accuracy? Or, if it is an image, is it a satirical cartoon or a grand portrait, a cheap engraving or an opulent oil painting? But, to establish this, we must also ask a number of other significant questions. It often helps to picture how the source was originally produced, and the person who produced it: Who were they? Where were they? In what conditions? For whom did they produce this text or object, and why? By asking these questions, we can begin to understand the source, and to think about how it might be useful historical evidence. In this section we have prepared a number of short collections of source material on a variety of very different areas of history, representing the sort of breadth you will find in the Cambridge History course. Many, perhaps all, of these periods will be unfamiliar to you. Don't let that put you off. You don't need to know anything at all about the periods to be able to read the sources and to glean something from them.In each unit you will find a brief introduction to the period followed by documentary and visual source material. The sources are followed by some questions to help you make sense of what you are looking at, and you will then be invited to take all the sources of that unit together and to think about what they definitely show, what they might show, and what they definitely do not show.Primary Sources Exercises >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

It might well be a document, and we often think of history as a textual discipline, based on the interpretation of written texts, but it might also be a building, a piece of art or an ephemeral object – a train ticket, say, or perhaps a pair of shoes. These are all 'sources' because they all provide us in different ways with information which can add to the sum of our knowledge of the past. Sources only become historical evidence, however, when they are interpreted by the historian to make sense of the past. The answers they provide will very much depend on the sorts of questions historians are asking. For example, a train ticket might be used to provide evidence of migration patterns or of the cost of living at a particular time, but also of broader cultural trends: for many years, for example, it was the practice to print a 'W' on a woman's ticket (this was when stations had women-only waiting rooms and trains had women-only carriages). As for a pair of shoes, it might provide the cultural historian with evidence of changing fashions and consumer tastes, or the social historian with evidence of class differences or production patterns. It all depends on what the historian wants to know. This is why it makes little sense to ask if something is 'good historical evidence', without knowing what evidence it's supposed to provide.Where do sources come from >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

web browser if you wish but then our site may not work correctly.Faculty of HistoryStudying at CambridgeAs we've seen, sources can come from anywhere. However, there is a process by which most sources find their way into the hands of historians. First, it needs to be stressed that the vast bulk of material produced by the past has been destroyed, either deliberately or by the ravages of time. A minuscule proportion of the clothes worn by people in the past, for example, has survived to be exhibited in costume and design museums. The same is true of the letters, articles and books historians often rely upon; many have been torn up, burnt, misplaced or ravaged by generations of peckish rodents. This is as true of recent history as it is of the more distant past. The process by which some pieces survive and come down to us can owe a huge amount to chance. Attics and back rooms are often full of material from the past, most of which will be cleared out at some point unless someone spots and keeps some of the more valuable pieces. Many historians undertaking research have tales of finding collections of letters or old diaries kept in old shoe boxes among the family junk of the writer’s descendants. We often have much more information about governments than about individuals or society as a whole because many governments kept documents for future reference from an early stage: in medieval England, for example, documents were routinely stored, and many now survive, albeit not without the occasional trace of damage at the hands of a peckish mouse!Sometimes people recognise much later, however, that papers might be of more general interest and deposit them in an archive. People in modern public life often think about this in advance and sort their papers ready for deposit. The Churchill Archive Centre in Cambridge, for example, has the papers of Sir Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, both of whom had done a lot of preliminary sorting and editing before sending the papers to Cambridge. But it is equally possible even for a leading politician simply to bundle papers into boxes and hand them over. In either case, the archivists must sort them out, read through them, arrange them by category or date, prepare a catalogue giving reference numbers and an idea of the content, and store them in such a way that they can easily be retrieved if a researcher asks to see them. Sometimes papers have been damaged and have to be restored by skilled conservators. Sometimes even the best skill cannot save documents which have been damaged by fire, flood or careless users. At other times, documents simply go missing, or are stolen by unscrupulous users. Admiral Lord Nelson’s insignia, presented to him by the Ottoman Sultan for his victory at the Battle of the Nile, was stolen from the National Maritime Museum and has never been recovered. To save papers from the effects of repeated use, archives have long sought to transfer their holdings into other forms. This is a massive undertaking and it has inevitably been overtaken by changes in technology. Many archives store holdings on microfilm, which is a reel of celluloid film spooled on to a reader machine with a large screen and read by winding the film from one spool to another. Some microfilm readers have a fast-spooling function, but others have to be operated manually. A later development was microfiche, a small rectangular sheet or fiche of acetate on which a number of documents can be stored and which is fed into a special microfiche reader; when one fiche is finished with it is taken out and the next one inserted. These techniques have been overtaken by the ease of scanning documents and putting them online, but few archives have the time or money to do this for all the documents which have already been put on microfilm or microfiche. Online storage has the advantage of allowing people to see documents without having to visit the archive (although even this is no substitute for the real thing: experienced historians are aware of how often the most telling details can be found on the back of a document). Another important mode of access to archival documents for those who cannot travel to a particular archive is the published source collection. This can be a very handy way of keeping a collection of relevant source material close at hand, and it has the advantage of carrying notes about the sources. However, the user remains dependent on the compiler-editor's choice of documents. Though printed collections are an indispensable resource for experienced researchers as much as for undergraduates, they can never give a full picture of a particular archive in all its rich complexity, and are no real substitute for a trip to the reading room. How to use Historical Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Thucydides has been called the father of ‘scientific history’ because he gathered all available evidence, talked to participants and then subjected his evidence to rigorous analysis in terms of cause and effect, rather than ascribing events to the intervention of the gods or fate. He has also been called the father of the school of ‘political realism’ because he saw relations between nations as being based on ‘might’ rather than ‘right’. Thucydides rightly realised that the conflict between Athens and Sparta that broke into open warfare in 431 BC was on a scale never before witnessed in the Greek world. He devoted the first book of his History to an explanation of how and why Athens came to war. Thucydides accepts that his History might not be so entertaining as others, but instead is trying to create a rational analysis that will help others understand the way things happen. He believes that events similar to those in the past will happen again in the future, because human nature is unchanging and he wants future generations to understand what causes war, and how it progresses. He does not, however, think that such understanding will necessarily prevent future wars. Bearing these things in mind, what does the source tell us about the Athenian leadership of the Delian League and the development of the Athenian empire?<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

In this extract he shows how the Athenians exploit their allies' hatred of Pausanias (a Spartan general suspected of collaborating with the Persians), and how they used the war to gain power over their allies as well as defeat the Persians. It is a clever way of exploiting the situation. Thucydides is showing this, as well as the military strength of the alliance, brought together so cleverly by the Athenians. Now read source 2 carefully and try to answer the questions which follow using only the internal evidence of the source.  Try to work out an answer, however tentative, to each of the following: << Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

It was written by Aristophanes, an Athenian comic poet whose plays were both politically very engaged and often obscene. By this time city audiences would have known the work of Aristophanes for at least 13 years and he was one of the city’s leading comic playwrights. Clearly Birds was primarily entertainment, but as with the work of modern playwrights such as David Hare it had an underlying political message and commentary. Birds was not as seriously political, however, as Aristophanes’ other works.At the time of first performance the Athenians were embroiled in the long and costly Peloponnesian War with the Spartans and were besieging Syracuse, having taken the bold step of attacking the previously neutral island of Sicily in an attempt to win the war. Some critics claim to find references to this in Birds, but it is more generally seen as an attempt to divert Athenians from their larger worries at this time by providing light relief rather than directly alluding to contemporary politics.In Birds Aristophanes constructs a fantasy in which the birds build a new city, Cloudcukooland, in the sky, between heaven and earth, guarded by birds, which will intercept all communication between the gods and their worshippers. Although less overtly political than Aristophanes’ other works, there are references to aspects of Athenian democracy which would have been familiar to contemporaries but less so to a modern audience. In the light of this information now consider the extract in more detail and try to answer the following questions. It may help you to know that proxenoi are citizens of state A, living in state A, but looking after the interests of citizens of state B, perhaps something like consular officials today.<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The inspector would rather be there, transacting private business, than being forced to visit Cloudcuckooland. Although some officials were elected, choosing by lot was a common practice, and in this case the lot has fallen on the Inspector. Voting urns were the equivalent of ballot boxes today. Sacrifice was an important ritual in Ancient Greece as part of a desire to establish and follow the will of the gods. A stele is an inscribed tablet on which decisions were recorded. Cloudcuckooland was plagued, as Athens’ allies were, by visits from various officious Athenians. The decrees offered by the Decree-seller are parodies of well known Athenian decrees, including one in which the Athenians attempted to enforce the use of Athenian units of weight and length and of Athenian coinage by all their tribute-paying allies. Although clearly aspects of this extract are there for comedy value and might be considered no more than slapstick, there would be no comedy if they did not strike a chord with contemporaries so it is possible to infer from the extract that the system of choosing officials by lot was not always popular, that some decrees were considered absurd and that government officials did not always command respect. Clearly this is not a source to use in isolation, but it might be used in conjunction with other sources to help confirm or reject an interpretation.Now read source 3 carefully.As to allies and their sailing out and bringing vexatious litigation against the upper classes whom they hate - the point is that they know that the ruler is bound to be hated by the ruled, and if the rich and respectable prevail in the cities, then the power of the Athenian people will be short-lived, so they remove the rights of the upper classes and confiscate their property, exile them and execute them, and they promote the poor.As before consider: << Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The pamphlet dates to the 420s or 410s and explains to a non-Athenian why it is that those in Athens who do not agree with democracy are nevertheless unable to overthrow it. It takes a somewhat cynical look at Athenian political practices.Xenophon was a pupil of Socrates who enlisted in the Athenian army under Cyrus in Upper Asia. He served in various armies with no preference for ties of nationality or country of preference.<< Previous Page :: Return to Start>> © 2017 University of Cambridge

Every age has distinctive attitudes and belief systems about the rights and wrongs of human authority. When we study these ideas we are doing the history of political thought. Over the past 2500 years political philosophers have argued for monarchy vs republics, for aristocracy vs democracy, for communism vs private property, for hierarchy vs equality, for empires vs city states. They have appealed to reason, nature, religion, and custom.In Tudor and Stuart England people debated the nature of kingly power and the extent of the duty of obedience to rulers. Radicals argued that tyrants, or heretics, should be overthrown by parliament or the people. Those who defended monarchical authority did so in opposition to 'resistance theory', and were fearful of threats to the English crown from Catholics and extreme Protestants alike, as well as from rebellions by the hungry or aggrieved. A wide range of arguments was used to uphold monarchical authority. Some of these we sum up as the theory of 'the divine right of kings'.A homily is a sermon, and this homily was issued under Queen Elizabeth I for regular use in the pulpits of English parish churches.1.

(However, enemies of absolute monarchical power certainly did appeal to Scripture.) Some of the arguments appeal to law-like propositions: the contractual nature of government ('mutual compact'). Some to 'natural law': that all human beings are naturally equal, so that legitimate government must arise from the consent of all. And some to historical arguments about the special and ancient nature of the English constitution: that it is made up of three equal elements, king, lords, and commons. 3.

Typically, the law of primogeniture prevailed: the right of the first born to succeed. In France, but not England, this right was confined to males. The law of 'birthright' could be problematic in several situations, such as an heir to the throne who was deemed incapable of sound government, or who was a 'heretic' or 'papist', who whose inheritance might involve one monarchy swallowing up another. Hence dynastic politics was at the heart of pre-modern politics. The University in this particular case was condemning those who wanted to prevent Charles II's brother and heir (he had no legitimate children) from inheriting the throne, on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic who should not be allowed to rule a Protestant country. James did inherit, in 1685, but was overthrown in a revolution in 1688.

The New Testament comprises the Gospels (the life and teachings of Jesus) and the Epistles (letters by Jesus's early followers). St Paul's Epistle contains a very clear command that subjects should obey earthly powers, or they will be damned. It seems therefore that the Christian is bound never to resist rulers. Note that this famous passage in the Epistle provides an everyday phrase in our language today: we refer to 'the powers that be' when we want to denote (often cheekily) those in authority over us.3. If you are a Christian believer, and wished to argue that it was sometimes legitimate to disobey earthly rulers (for example, if they imposed a brutally racist regime), how would you go about getting around St Paul's teaching?<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

For example, they said that Paul commanded obedience to 'powers' in the plural, and that 'lesser powers' like parliament or noblemen or clergy could restrain the 'greater power' of the monarch. Or they pointed out that Paul went on to say that earthly powers are ordained 'for good', so that Paul only referred to good powers. Or, if truly revolutionary, they could argue that the power of the revolutionary was ordained by God, since 'all' powers are, and that providence favoured the righteous in a war against a tyrant.

Thus, the second or political argument is that kingship is a natural form of government because it is like the natural hierarchy of the father of a family. And the third sort is that kingship reflects another part of the natural order, namely the physical body, where the head commands the body; (writers often spoke of civil society as a 'body politic').2.

Writers also talked of the lion being king of the jungle, and noted that beehives were monarchical. Thus, monarchy belonged to the divine natural order of things.3.

It is one of four written by Pope Urban II while the First Crusade was being prepared and repeats some of the decisions of the Council of Clermont in November 1095. It is a call to crusade promising those who go that they will be cleansed of all their sins; in other words, crusaders would go to heaven. If a crusade was to happen and stand a chance of success, there needed to be large numbers of people prepared to go East, so the reward had to be a very good one if they were to be induced to go. We can tell then that the writer was directly connected with events because he is writing directly to those who are thinking of joining the crusade: ‘we have heard’, he says, ‘that many of you have felt the longing to go’. We should therefore read this extract as the pope’s perspective on the crusade; perhaps people were longing to go, but Urban obviously felt the need to bolster numbers by offering a pardon of all sins as an additional incentive. Would people have gone anyway, or did this offer make a great difference to the numbers of people who eventually went East? We will probably never know.Now consider the content of the extract in more detail and consider the following questions: << Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The suggestion is that it is more appropriate to go on Crusade for reasons of piety rather than greed. The two further references are to decrees which were intended to control recruitment and secure the marital rights of wives. Europe could not be left without sufficient priests and monks to pray for and look after the spiritual needs of those who had not been able to go on crusade, so bishops and abbots would have needed to monitor carefully those clerics and monks who went. At the same time, wives could only be left behind if it was possible for them to maintain the estates and households of those who had gone away. In other words, the pope was here balancing the need to raise crusaders to try to re-capture the Holy Land with the spiritual needs of those who remained at home, and with the need for there to be adequate protection for the lands and property of those who were going East.<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Charters were documents recording grants, usually of land, but sometimes of other property or rights. They were thus the medieval equivalent of what we now call deeds, and were designed to ensure that everyone’s rights in the transaction were protected later.Many charters record the steps taken by crusaders to raise money for the expedition and the measures taken by kindred to help them. In this case a crusader sells half a county to his maternal uncle, who in turn pledges the land in order to pay him. Maternal uncles tended to be the natural protectors of their nephews, whereas paternal uncles were natural competitors. This source shows that there could be great personal sacrifice involved for crusaders and their families.The charter also provides an example of the way canons and monks stripped their churches and reliquaries of precious metals to raise money for the crusaders, establishing the precedent for future actions of this sort.Finally do the same exercise for the third source:© 2017 University of Cambridge

He had been educated as a clerk in a monastery in Vezelay, was ordained during the journey to the east, and was a chaplain in the household of Raymond of St Gilles, count of Toulouse. He produced one of four eyewitness narratives of the Crusades and is considered a very important chronicler, even though he was mostly describing visions and miracles. His language and imagery tend to biblical and liturgical rather than descriptive, but this is not unusual for the time. One of the visions and miracles he described was the discovery, at which he was present, of the relic of the Holy Lance, under the floor of the cathedral of Antioch. In Christian mythology the Holy Lance is the lance used at the crucifixion.The Lance’s hiding place had been revealed to the visionary Peter Bartholomew. Although many of the leaders of the crusade were sceptical about the discovery, believing Peter Bartholomew to be a charlatan, it proved to be a turning point and boosted the morale of the Crusaders at a time when they themselves were besieged.Finally, take all these sources together and look at the following statements. For each statement decide to what extent it is supported by the evidence of these extracts. It may be shown to be true; shown to be probably true; shown to be possibly true; shown to be untrue; or not shown (which does not necessarily mean it is not true, merely that no evidence for it has been shown here).a) The Crusaders were motivated by greed:<<Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

In fact source 2 suggests that there are considerable costs involved in going on Crusade, with Geoffrey of Donzy selling half a county to fund his journey.Probably true: There are hints in source 1 that some men are going on Crusade because they seek earthly profit, but this is not approved by Pope Urban II. It would be stretching the evidence to say that this makes the statement probably true.Possibly true: It might be possible to say that some Crusaders are motivated by greed from the hints in source 1 but this set of evidence is insufficient to make a general statement.Definitely untrue: No. The evidence does not support this, not least the evidence of source 2 as to the costs. The statement is too sweeping to be supported by three sources. It would be unlikely that all Crusaders shared the same motivation but your own experience might suggest that it is also unlikely that greed played no part in the motivation of any Crusader.Not shown by the evidence: In some ways this might be the best answer. There is certainly no direct evidence in these sources to support this statement. Other sources would need to be consulted to give a definitive answer.b) The Crusaders were motivated by piety:<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is clear from source 1 that Pope Urban II would like Crusaders to be motivated by piety and that he offers them remission of sins if they are, but the fact that this needs to be stated may hint that there are other motives. Probably true: It is too strong a statement to say that all Crusaders were motivated by piety based on these three sources, although there is an implication at least of piety in all of them.Possibly true: It is certainly possible to say that some crusaders are motivated by piety. Pope Urban II refers to this and it is probably reasonable to assume that Geoffrey of Donzy has religious motivation as he is selling his property and being supported by the local Church. Whether or not Peter Bartholomew in source 3 is a charlatan, his actions convince some of those around him that he was inspired by God. This suggests that this is the best of the statements.Definitely untrue: The fact that there is some reference to piety in all three sources means that this statement is not correct.Not shown by the evidence: Again, all three sources have some reference to piety so this is not correct.<< Go Back :: Return to Start >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Although the English Reformation was closely linked to developments in continental Europe, in its details it was distinctive and developed in ways that were peculiar to England.One such distinctive feature was that the English Reformation did not begin with a theological dispute, as the German Reformation had done, but with a very practical issue: the king desperately wanted to produce a son and heir to his throne. His Spanish queen, Catherine of Aragon, gave birth to a daughter, the Lady Mary, but as her subsequent pregnancies failed it became increasingly obvious that she would never bear Henry a son. When the attractive and ambitious figure of Anne Boleyn appeared at court, Henry grew impatient to end his marriage to Catherine so he could marry Anne. However, for a mixture of political and theological reasons, his wishes were frustrated by the pope, whose permission Henry needed to declare his marriage to Catherine null and void. Henry, encouraged by reform-minded figures at court (including Anne), therefore decided to take the momentous step of ending England’s long-standing attachment to Rome and establishing a new royal state Church which, as one of its first acts, would grant Henry the divorce from Catherine that he so ardently desired.These documents look at some of the issues involved in the Henrician Reformation.Questions >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

It meets the common objection that, as Henry had an heir already, there was no urgent need to take further steps to secure the succession.A French translation was specially printed in October 1532 to be distributed among French councillors and courtiers when Henry and Anne crossed the Channel to meet King Francis I of France at Boulogne that autumn and secure French political support for their marriage.2.

This in itself indicates the importance Henry’s government placed on gaining public acceptance for the divorce, both to avoid the risk of an uprising and to enable Henry to stand up to foreign opposition.However the preface, from which this passage comes, sets out the wider context by considering the issue of having a queen regnant – i.e. a queen reigning in her own right. It assumes that a queen must marry and that this will in itself prove an insuperable barrier. Not only does it raise the question of the husband’s dominant role with regards to his wife, but the husband’s origins must count against the match wherever he might come from. Firstly, there are political objections: it argues that it would be unacceptable to allow a Scot or Frenchman to rule England when the kings of England claim sovereignty over both those kingdoms, while marrying an English nobleman would cause resentment among all the other nobles and lead to trouble. Were Mary to marry a foreigner, the Glasse argues, ‘proximity of blood’ (because the Spanish royal family, form whom Mary was descended through her mother, was so closely related to all the royal houses of Europe) would bring Mary within the ‘prohibited error’ of incest and thus render her and her realm liable to divine vengeance. This might be considered the weakest part of the argument, but the emphasis on the horror in which incest is held helps to strengthen it considerably.Thus the Glasse of the Truthe set out an agenda which would not only make the political case for the divorce but would also hang over the question of royal marriage and the succession throughout the reigns of Mary I and Elizabeth I.NOTE: Jehosophat, Hezekiah and Josias were all kings in the Old Testament; Levites were a type of Jewish clergy.3.

The letter is dated ca. 1537. It was sent, but not necessarily printed, at the time: the earliest surviving copy is a text printed at London in 1560, during Elizabeth’s reign. Printing it not only bolstered the case for royal governorship of the Church, but it helped confound Catholic objections, since both Tunstall and Stokesley were prominent opponents of the religious changes of Henry’s reign.4. What appears to be the relevance of the reference to kings of the Old Testament to the situation in England in the 1530s? << Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Central to the case for the royal supremacy of the Church was the argument that it could be defended by biblical and historical precedent. Cuthbert Tunstall and John Stokesley therefore wrote this letter attacking the supremacy of the Pope and upholding that of the king, arguing that the authority which the kings of ancient Israel (Jehosophat, etc) exercised over their priests in the times of the Old Testament should be a model for Christian kings in the times since the New Testament. They further claim the Christian Roman Emperors of the 4th and 5th centuries as precedents for the exercise of this biblical authority over clergymen by Christian rulers.The invocation of biblical authority and ‘imperial’ precedents was central to the establishment and defence of the Henrician royal supremacy. Henry came to see himself increasingly in the light of an Old Testament king, most obviously in his personal copy of the Psalms, which included a series of handsome illustrations showing King David (then believed to be the author of most of the Psalms) with the facial features of Henry himself.5.

He had acquired a first-class Renaissance education in Italy at the king’s expense, but by the early 1530s he found himself increasingly alienated from Henry’s policies. Spurning almost certain promotion to the archbishopric of either York or Canterbury, Pole returned to Italy. After the execution of John Fisher and Thomas More in 1535 for denying Henry’s claims to royal supremacy over the Church of England, Pole composed a powerful and sophisticated refutation of the king’s position, his Defence of the Unity of the Church. Although it was not printed until some years later, Pole sent a manuscript copy to Henry and his Council, and various English scholars were commissioned to refute Pole in turn, including Tunstall and Stokesley.In 1535, Henry VIII launched a nationwide ‘visitation’ – or enquiry – into England’s monasteries and religious houses. The main purpose of this was to ensure that each and every one of England’s monks signed up to the royal supremacy in person, but it also aimed at investigating and improving their moral condition. The visitation was organised by Thomas Cromwell, a loyal political administrative servant who had helped Henry draft the legislation breaking the link with Rome and whom in 1535 Henry appointed Vicegerent in Spirituals, i.e. the administrative head of Church matters under the king.(The words given here in italics were written in Latin in the original.)6.

It is dated Bristol, 24 August 1535.7. Which of these statements best conveys the meaning of the passage?i) The Prior of Maiden Bradley is an old rogue, peddling false relics and seducing every pretty girl he can get his hands on.ii) Strange and miraculous things are to be seen at Maiden Bradley and here are some of them. The Prior is a family man and has been falsely accused of seducing married women. He actually has official permission from Rome to keep a prostitute, should he so choose.iii) The truth or otherwise of these relics from Maiden Bradley can be determined by reading scripture. The holy father Prior hopes to marry off his children soon; he always ensued that every girl he had an affair with got a husband.<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

All too often it is easy for us to look rather patronisingly at the beliefs and practices of earlier ages and to judge them by our own standards, instead of trying to understand them according to the standards and beliefs of the time. The medieval period has suffered particularly badly from this heavily present-centred view of the past. Medieval people had a very acute sense of the close relationship between the different spheres of existence: the world, the heavens, the natural world and the world of spirits.

Nonetheless, it offers interesting clues about medieval conceptions of the 'civilized' man and also, in Ralph's closing words, the intellectual categories in which medieval writers tried to locate strange beings.By drawing on images and texts we can start to understand how medieval men and women imagined the larger world around them. But these sorts of stories about the extraordinary also hint at what medieval men and women thought about the ordinary human world, about 'normality', by revealing characteristics which made someone 'wild' and placed them outside it.<< Go Back ::  Return to Start >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Ralph was abbot of the Cistercian monastery at Coggeshall in Essex. He shared in common with many monks an interest in history and the chronicle he composed in the early thirteenth century dwells principally on politics and the affairs of the church. Many such chronicles were composed by monks and their main readership was among the monastic and university communities (universities were part of the monastic world). In common with other chroniclers, Ralph was interested in the activities of invisible beings which were thought to populate the medieval cosmos, such as ghosts, angels and demons, and he was also concerned with monstrous and other beings on the boundaries of the human world. There is no indication that Ralph was in any way connected with the events he describes; in the absence of further evidence we must assume that he is recounting in good faith a tale that he had heard.B) Now consider the content of the extract in a bit more detail.

The large ornate cover for the font is a much later addition: these covers were often installed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and winched up when the font was in use. The font is used in the sacrament (sacred rite) of baptism, also known as christening. The Church taught that all children are born with Original Sin, the sin originally committed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, imprinted on their souls. This sin needed to be erased if the child were to have the possibility of going to Heaven and this was done by a symbolic washing in water, known as baptism. The water was contained in the font and poured over the child’s head. The ceremony was based on the practice described in the New Testament whereby John the Baptist bathed people in the River Jordan as a symbol of their rejection of sin and embarking on a new, purified life. Baptism also served as a ceremony of welcome by the church community to a new member. Baptism, or christening, is still an important rite of passage in Christian communities today.D) The font is decorated with images associated with baptism and its base is adorned, in between the lions, with club-wielding 'woodwoses', 'wild men' of the woods.

The angels here appear to be supporting the font, which would fit in with the idea of their subservience to the requirements of God. The heraldic shields, which were often originally brightly painted, would usually display the coats of arms of prominent local families. Much of the fabric of parish churches was often paid for by local lordly families and they would expect, and often require, that their coats of arms be displayed prominently. Fonts were often placed at the west end of the church, the opposite end from the altar, or else, as here, near the door. On a practical level this meant that a baptism could be celebrated without having to use the main altar and choir stalls; more symbolically, its proximity to the entrance to the church symbolises the child’s entry into the Christian community. Exactly what the woodwoses are doing on a font is not easy to establish; images are intrinsically more ambiguous than written texts. A possible symbolism is that they reflect the nature of an infant before baptism (wild, untamed, tainted by sin, outside the civilized community of believers); this nature would then be washed away by the baptismal water; this might also explain why the wild men are positioned at the bottom, next to the floor; the higher part of the structure, supported by God’s angels, is where salvation is to be found.Finally, take the two sources together and look at the following statements. For each statement decide to what extent it is supported by the evidence of these extracts. It may be shown to be true; shown to be probably true; shown to be possibly true; shown to be untrue; or not shown (which does not necessarily mean it is not true, merely that no evidence for it has been shown here).A.

Richard himself did not survive the coup and he left no heir, so, perhaps inevitably, the takeover sparked off a power struggle between Bolingbroke and other claimants to the throne, many of whose claims were stronger. Nevertheless, Bolingbroke, who had taken the title King Henry IV, was able to defeat his rivals and secure his dynasty on the throne: when he died his son succeeded him as King Henry V. Henry V also faced plots to overthrow him, though he too was able to defeat them. Henry V established himself as a popular figure by ruling very effectively within England and through great victories in France, the most famous of which was the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The resulting peace treaty, the Treaty of Troyes of 1420, laid down that Henry should marry a French princess, Catherine de Valois, and that their son should inherit the French, as well as the English, crown.In 1421 a son was born to the couple and christened Henry. Only nine months later, however, Henry V died and the infant became King Henry VI. A king succeeding at such a young age inevitably meant a long period of regency. In Henry VI’s case a Council of Regency was set up under the chairmanship of the king’s uncle, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester. Such a situation was bound to provoke jostling for power at court, but the situation might have been containable had the situation in France not suddenly collapsed. The French rose in rebellion against English dominance, under the inspiring leadership of Joan of Arc. The disastrous news from France kindled deep feelings of bitterness at court in England, which came to a head in 1450, when Normandy was lost. England’s proud French empire was now reduced to the area around Calais.The situation might have been different had Henry VI himself been a stronger character after the model of his father and grandfather. In fact, however, Henry was a non-entity, easily persuaded to do whatever those about told him to do. He also suffered repeated bouts of a crippling mental condition. Although the nobility attempted to cover up the king's inadequacies by presenting government as normal, they were unable to agree on critical decisions, like what to do about the threat to English possessions in France. And so, by 1450 France had been lost and Henry VI's greatest lords could no longer pretend that the king was actually ruling.Two main groups soon emerged with different views on how the realm should be governed in the absence of an effective king. One was associated with the court and centred around the Duke of Somerset, who advocated others ruling in the king's name informally; the other, led by the Duke of York, favoured setting up an official council to rule in the king's stead. As time went on, the disputes between these groups and between individual nobles over land became worse and worse. At the same time, the queen, Margaret of Anjou, took the side of one of the parties; with her she took the king. This meant that the other party was, despite attempts to avoid this, fighting the king himself. The intense political in-fighting finally came to blows in a pitched battle at St Albans in 1455 which York won. York hoped simply to take over the running of the king’s government, but the queen and the court party did not stop their opposition and finally in 1460, taking advantage of his royal descent (he had a better dynastic claim to the throne than Henry VI, he argued), the Duke of York formally claimed the throne. York’s action immediately sparked off war between his followers, the House of York, also known as Yorkists, and the court party, led by Queen Margaret and known as the House of Lancaster or Lancastrians. The Duke of York himself was killed early in the war, when he was defeated by Queen Margaret in battle at Wakefield and executed for treason. However his claim to the throne passed to the eldest of his three sons, Edward, earl of March. After a period of manoeuvre and counter-manoeuvre, Edward heavily defeated the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton, still the bloodiest battle ever to have been fought on English soil, and had himself crowned King Edward VI.However, once one seizure of the throne based on a better dynastic claim had been made, others followed, and in the 1480s, Richard of Gloucester similarly took the throne from Edward IV's son to become Richard III. He was then ousted by Henry Tudor in 1485, who became Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty. The war between the two houses of Lancaster and York became known later as the Wars of the Roses, from two heraldic badges, a white rose for the House of York and a red rose for the House of Lancaster. In fact these rose motifs were relatively little used in the fighting, and, as we have seen, events were much more complicated than the story of a power-hungry nobility suggests.Questions >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

As a result, Richard was forced to fall back on his solid body of support in the North of England: his ‘repeat coronation’ was an important part of this process. However, his dependence on the North served to alienate other parts of the kingdom, as the Crowland Chronicle reflects. Speculation about the fate of the princes began early and served to alienate opinion still further; it also helped to unite different groups of opponents in looking for any candidate to replace Richard. Later, Tudor propaganda – not least Shakespeare’s Richard III – would suggest that Henry Tudor was a messianic figure, a saviour waiting in exile for the call to return; this extract suggests that he was happened upon simply as the only alternative claimant available.J a) Finally, take all these sources together and look at the following statements.

He knew the king well and was of great importance to him, since Henry VI was deeply pious. In the extract, however, some phrases suggest he knew the king personally and some imply perhaps that he did not. On the basis of this extract it would be reasonable to argue the matter either way. Since Blacman was close to the king, we might expect this work to stress Henry's positive features, as indeed it does. However, it is written entirely about his personal virtues and his simple mode of living; there is little about his role in politics and what there is might not inspire confidence in Henry’s political skill: he gives away his property, he is apt to go into trances without warning, and he lost control both of England and of France. The key lies in the purpose behind Blacman’s writing: he was building a case for Henry’s canonisation, the process by which someone is declared a saint by the Church. It was therefore written not in order to convince nobles that Henry VI was a good king, but to convince the cardinals of the Church and the pope himself that Henry was a saint.The text comes from: Henry the Sixth: A Reprint of John Blacman’s Memoir, ed. and trans. M.R. James (Cambridge, 1919).Edward IVThe next two sources deal with Henry VI’s rival for the throne, Edward IV. Edward IV (1461-1483) turned out to be a very different kind of king from Henry VI. Edward established his rule by a mixture of force and conciliation, with the assistance of a relatively small number of noble supporters, notably Richard Neville, earl of Warwick.However, just when Edward’s position seemed secure against challenge by the supporters of Henry VI, it suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. The earl of Warwick, who had played a major part in putting Edward on the throne, grew increasingly disillusioned with him, especially when in 1464 Edward secretly married Elizabeth Woodville, a member of a recently ennobled family, just as Warwick was about to finalise the details of a diplomatic marriage for Edward with a French princess. In 1469 Warwick, in co-operation with the king’s own brother, George, duke of Clarence, launched a coup against Edward, forcing him to flee the country. Warwick then brought Henry VI out of imprisonment in the Tower and placed him back on the throne. It was Warwick’s role in overthrowing and crowning both Henry and Edward that earned the nickname ‘the Kingmaker’.Edward, however, was not defeated for long. In 1471 he returned to England in force, defeated and killed Warwick in battle at Barnet, north of London, and had Henry VI overthrown and returned to the Tower. Edward and his youngest brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, then went after the remaining Lancastrian forces, commanded by Queen Margaret of Anjou and the Prince of Wales. At the Battle of Tewkesbury the Yorkists crushed the Lancastrians, killed the Prince of Wales and captured both Queen Margaret and the Princess of Wales, Warwick’s daughter Anne. Edward then had Henry VI murdered in the Tower of London. Tewkesbury seemed to mark the end of the Wars of the Roses. All credible rivals to Edward VI were dead and he was able to set about the business of governing the kingdom. The Lancastrian dynasty had died out and the Lancastrian claim was only kept alive by a distant relative-by-marriage of Henry VI, Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, who was forced to flee into exile in Brittany.Edward’s reputation has oscillated between praise and blame. Some historians have regarded him as a lightweight and a playboy, bringing about his own troubles through his sexual adventures and his tendency to forgive his enemies only for them to rebel against him. Others have stressed his active engagement in royal government and have put a positive spin even on his more dubious money-raising schemes.Perhaps the most damning assessments of Edward’s reign, however, relate to the events which followed his premature death in 1483. Edward bequeathed the throne to his teenage son, Edward V, but in a breathtaking move, the throne was seized by the late king’s youngest brother, Richard, duke of Gloucester, who had previously been Edward IV’s loyal servant in the North.This picture shows King Edward IV. Look at it carefully, and then try to answer the question that follows.B) What strikes you interesting about this picture of Edward IV?<< Go Back :: Find out more >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The book is a long romance about the siege of Troy by the ancient Greeks. It was written in verse by the poet John Lydgate in the first half of the fifteenth century; this edition, however, dates from later. We can tell this because it shows Edward IV crowned, clothed in coronation regalia and seated on the throne. The book was completed in at least two stages: most of the work has been dated to c1455-1462, but some of the miniatures and heraldic emblems were only added in the 1520s. The story of Troy was especially significant for the English because their foundation myth was that the English nation had been established by soldiers who had travelled right across Europe and the Middle East at the end of the Trojan wars.

This copy of The Troy Book was commissioned by William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, as a way of demonstrating his loyalty to the new regime: he and his wife Anne are the figures kneeling at the king’s feet, presenting him with the manuscript of the poem. Pembroke did indeed prove loyal to Edward and died fighting for him at the Battle of Edgecote in 1469. Choosing a poem about the fabled city of Troy was significant because, by tradition, the English liked to think they were descended from the Trojans and London was sometimes called ‘New Troy’ by poets; the implication is therefore that Edward IV is the descendant of the kings of Troy.This extract offers a personal description of Edward IV.

Mancini’s picture of Edward IV is in many ways a literary exercise in explaining his fall, but it also suggests something of Edward’s strengths and weaknesses as a king. Being based in London, Mancini was better informed about Edward IV’s court than about Richard, then duke of Gloucester, who spent most of his time in the North. Moreover, Mancini was back on the continent by the end of 1483.Source extract comes from Dominic Mancini, The Usurpation of Richard the Third, trans. and ed. C.A.J.

Richard justified his move by blackening Edward IV’s character and accusing Edward IV of promiscuity; he further claimed that Edward V was illegitimate. It therefore made sense for Mancini, who clearly knew far more about Edward than he did about Richard, to present Edward in a very positive light but surrounded by more manipulative people, including his brother Richard and the queen. As a foreigner in England himself, Mancini could be expected to approve of Edward’s welcoming approach to them, which thus gives the impression that if Edward was at fault, it was because he was naturally trusting. The last sentence in this extract shows Mancini justifying Edward’s conduct in the light of some of the criticism that was directed at him.These two sources deal with King Richard III.Generations of historians have speculated about the personality and motives of Richard III (1483-5). Richard, duke of Gloucester had been a loyal servant of his brother Edward IV, helping him to re-establish his power in the North of England after the disruption of 1469-71. Yet on Edward’s sudden death in 1483 at the age of 41, Richard seized the king’s two sons and had himself appointed Protector. He then had the queen’s brother, Anthony Lord Rivers and Lord Hastings, who had been Edward IV’s right-hand man with responsibility for the Midlands, arrested and executed. Richard next declared that Edward’s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid and that therefore Edward IV’s sons were illegitimate. Finally Richard set himself up as king.Initially, Richard’s coup was successful, perhaps because he appeared to guarantee continuity and good govenment, in contrast with the sort of self-interested grab for power the Woodvilles might have made. However, it soon became clear that the new king could only rule with the support of his supporters in the North. He had to deal with a major revolt by his former supporter, the Duke of Buckingham. Finally, in 1485, he was overthrown in an invasion led by Henry Tudor, the last and almost forgotten Lancastrian claimant to the throne, and supported both by the few remaining partisans of Henry VI and the former associates of Edward IV.This source dates from early in Richard III’s reign.

No statement about the past can carry conviction unless it can be supported by reference to the historical sources, the evidence upon which historians base their ideas and interpretations. Historians inevitably spend a lot of time reading each other's writings, but the real historical work is done – and the real enjoyment is to be had – in studying the sources, the actual 'stuff' of history. Source material is widely used in history teaching at school, but often it is very different from the real thing. For school use, written sources are usually cut down in length, sometimes to little more than a couple of lines, the language is often simplified, and each source is given a label: Source A, Source B and so on. There are very good reasons for all of these steps, but they do mean that real source material encountered at university level can come as a something of a shock. Not only are real sources not edited in the way that their school equivalents are, but they look very different too. In a textbook or on an examination paper an extract from a nineteenth-century letter, for example, will be clearly printed and legible; indeed, there would be complaints were it otherwise. The Victorian original, however, might be the exact opposite: to save money on paper and postage, nineteenth-century writers would often write in lines across the page and then turn the letter through 90° and carry on writing over the previous lines, so that the lines of writing formed squares and the letter ended up looking like a grid, which can be very difficult for modern eyes to read. Similarly, excerpts from Nazi writings commonly feature in school textbooks and examinations; the originals, however, were not only in German but often in gothic script which, again, can take some getting used to. Handwriting from earlier ages looked very different from modern script, not least because of the physical demands of writing with quill and ink and because the high cost of parchment and paper meant that it was important to put as much as possible on to a single sheet. Medieval and early modern writings are therefore full of abbreviations which can mislead the unwary reader.1However, it is well worth making the effort to read documents in the original. To start with, there is an undeniable thrill to be had from opening and reading a document that was first written centuries ago and which looks as if it ought to be under glass in a museum. Indeed, yours might even be the first eyes to read it since it was sealed. Secondly, the original nearly always offers the reader a lot more than the short extracts which make their way into history books. It is always important to see the context for sayings or quotations; it might affect the sense or reveal more about the original writer’s intentions than an abbreviated version. Either way, it will certainly give you a fuller, more rounded understanding.What are Historical Sources? >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Historical writing and research can take many forms, and historians have increasingly found venues for their research in television and radio documentaries, or in articles in the press and on the internet. But, for the most part, they also continue communicate their findings in specialist books, textbooks, and articles in learned journals intended to stimulate understanding and discussion of the past.All of these different forms of writing cater towards specific readerships, and the way in which historians present their arguments varies accordingly to the needs and preferences of these various audiences. It is also important to remember that the readership for historical writing has changed significantly over time; historical writing has changed accordingly. This section will introduce you to a wide range of different types of historical writing in order to illustrate how the alert student should approach the task of reading it.Secondary Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

This does not mean that historians are any less rigorous in their scholarship, but the pressure to sell has led to the development of a number of best-selling works. This section invites you to look at two examples of this phenomenon.

For the second half of the sixteenth century the stability of Europe hung on the outcome of the long war in the Netherlands between the Dutch and the Spanish, known to history as the ‘Dutch Revolt’. The Netherlands, which also included modern-day Belgium, constituted the Duchy of Burgundy and was ruled by King Philip II of Spain, who inherited the title from his father. The city states of Burgundy fell out with Philip when they thought he was riding rough-shod over their separate rights and privileges, which they guarded jealously. What started as a political dispute among the nobility, or ‘grandees’ as they were called, developed into a full-scale revolt when Philip despatched the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands with a huge army and authority to rule by decree. Feelings on both sides were embittered still further by religion: Philip saw himself as the protector of God’s Catholic Church, but Calvinism, a radical form of Protestantism, had taken root in the region, especially in the northern, Dutch-speaking part. Many Dutch Protestants saw the war less as a political conflict, or even a war of national liberation, but rather as a religious war against the ‘antichrist’ represented by the Pope and King Philip.The Dutch prince who emerged as the leader of the revolt was William of Orange, known, from his cautious and reflective manner, as ‘William the Silent’. Catholics and Protestants across Europe saw the conflict in the Netherlands as a paradigm for the struggle between their different versions of Christianity, rather as people in the 1930s saw the Spanish Civil War as an international clash between fascism and communism. William of Orange became an iconic figure, a Protestant champion, taking on the might of Catholic Spain.Lisa Jardine is a historian of the early modern period specialising on the interplay of politics and culture. She is also a prolific broadcaster. She chose the moment of William’s assassination in 1584 at the hands of a Catholic monk as the theme of a short and lively study. Monarchs had been murdered by usurpers often enough in the past, but assassination by a stranger in a crowd was a new phenomenon, though one which was becoming increasingly common; there were numerous assassination plots, for example, against William’s contemporary, Elizabeth I. William’s assassination had a profound impact on Protestant hopes across Europe; interestingly, it was also the first time a head of state had been assassinated with the new technology of the handgun.<< Two Assassinations :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Under torture Gérard first claims that he was put up to the assassination by the Duke of Parma and other Spanish noblemen, but he later retracts this and claims he acted alone, which seems to be the truth.This is a good example of vivid narrative, written like a novel. The first paragraph has the sort of detail that a novelist would include: William is making for the stairs, Gérard steps forward out of the crowd, William is carried through to a couch, and so on. On the other hand, there are reminders that we are reading a historical recreation rather than a novelist’s invention: the insertion of ‘one imagines’ before ‘brutally manhandled’ keeps even this action-packed account within the strict confines of the evidence. Most of the passage deals directly with the characters, rather as if Jardine was there as an eye-witness, but towards the end of the passage the focus begins to widen as she describes the message that was to spread through ‘the many broadsheets and pamphlets’ that spread the news across Europe.<< Extract :: Language and Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Indeed, there is almost a clinical aspect to the description of the trajectory of the bullets and the detail that the fatal bullet lodged ‘beneath his breast’. There is more descriptive language in the second paragraph – the scene is one of ‘pandemonium’; Balthasar answers ‘very obstinately’; William of Orange is a ‘vile heretic’ – but closer inspection shows that only the first of these is Jardine’s own; the second is in quotation marks and the third would also seem to be a quotation. The use of ‘solitary fanatic’, although the phrase has a modern ring to it, seems from the context to be her rendition in modern language of the version being put out by the Dutch authorities, rather than her own description of the assassin. Elsewhere, she avoids the temptation to give us all the gory details of Gérard’s interrogation and contents herself with her comment (surely justified) that he was probably roughly manhandled, followed by ‘Questioned again under duress’, and ‘subjected to extreme torture’, all of which convey that he was treated very brutally without going into details. In other words, a careful reading of the language of the passage reveals that, although at first reading it might seem that Jardine is writing inventively, in fact she is keeping her own voice back and allowing the sources she has used to convey the colour and tone of the episode.This is an example of a new genre of history books written without footnotes to distract the general reader. This technique has undoubtedly helped the sales of history books, but it does make it difficult for historians wanting to follow up the writer’s sources. That Jardine has based this on original sources is clear from the detail of her account and is confirmed by the passages in quotation marks; however, we have to guess what these might be quotations from. ‘Beneath his breast’ presumably comes from an eye witness account though it might equally originate from a surgeon’s report; the description of Gérard’s obstinacy under questioning and the admission that nothing further could be got from him must have come from someone involved in his questioning, presumably reporting to the other Dutch princes. The footnote, however, takes us to the set of appendices at the end of the book, where Jardine has reproduced a selection of significant documents associated with the murder. Thus, even though her publishers are avoiding footnotes lest they deter non-academic readers, she has managed to provide enough evidence to indicate the sort of sources on which she has based her account.<< Commentary :: Simon Sebag Montefiore Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, until the advent of the policy of glasnost (openness) brought in by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbechev, who took power in the former Soviet Union in 1985, the archives of the Soviet Union were closed to scholars; there was therefore a scramble to get into the archives to read papers that had been kept hidden from any but the most subservient communist academics. Inevitably this process forced scholars to revise judgements which had had to be made in the absence of corroboration from Soviet sources. For example, the opening of the archives occasioned an often angry debate about the precise numbers killed in Stalin’s purges; the figures suggested that the true figure was considerably more than the estimations of left-wing western historians, especially those still politically sympathetic to Stalin, but that they still fell far short of the huge figures that had been given by more hostile historians. Simon Sebag Montefiore decided to use the archives to take a slightly different approach to Stalin from the norm. Instead of producing a political biography, he looked more at Stalin as an individual, at how he passed his time and how he balanced his leisure time with his running of the Soviet Union – often, indeed, the two overlapped. The result was not a biography in the normal sense of the term: rather it was a portrait of Stalin among his entourage. It was Sir Ian Kershaw, himself a former medievalist, who described Hitler’s style of government as like that of a royal court, with the king at the centre surrounded by courtiers absolutely dependent on his good favour. Montefiore portrays Stalin’s style of government in much the same way; indeed, the book itself talks of the ‘court of the red tsar’.<< Two Assassinations :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Witnesses differ in their versions of exactly what happened next. Kirov was certified dead and it was decided that Stalin should be informed.This is a lively reconstruction of Kirov’s assassination. It is full of detail, even down to Nikolaev letting Kirov pass in the stairwell or Kirov’s friends loosening his collar. The detail is such that we can feel almost that we are there too; even the uncertainty about the exact sequence of events adds to the reality since, as Montefiore says, there is indeed a special sort of miasma (i.e. a cloud that envelops events, rendering them opaque and unreal) which descends in moments of extreme emergency.It might be thought that all Montefiore is doing here is reconstructing events as far as he can from the various eye-witness accounts. Crimes generate such accounts by their very nature and so lend themselves to this sort of reconstruction. Nevertheless, Montefiore does let slip some of his own take on events. His comment that doctors in dictatorships are scared of dead eminent patients, offered without further corroboration, is a personal comment on dictatorships, though one for which there are certainly plenty of other examples. When it comes to the Bolsheviks themselves, Montefiore is quite sarcastic. He gets in a jibe at the dying Kirov as ‘a Bolshevik workaholic to the last’ because he was still holding (Montefiore’s word is ‘gripping’) his briefcase as he died; you might consider how well the comment works in this particular context. The reference to ‘a trail of heroic Bolshevik sacrament’ is more openly sarcastic, deliberately contrasting the lofty concept of a sacrament with the more prosaic ‘down the corridor’. The image here is of a blood sacrifice for the general good, in which the blood itself is revered as a holy relic: the obvious comparison is with the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and the idea here is that Kirov was regarded as a sort of Soviet Christ. The imagery invites us to imagine Bolsheviks mopping up Kirov’s blood from the floor as a holy relic, as people are reported to have done with Charles I’s blood, dipping their handkerchiefs in it after his execution. He does not, however, mention any Bolsheviks actually doing this.Lastly, aware always that he is writing for a general readership who may know little of the people and events he describes beyond what is in his book, Montefiore adds a brief reference to something he can be fairly sure his readers will have heard about, the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. It is popularly said that everyone around at the time could remember for years afterwards where they were when they heard the news of his assassination; this is taken as a measure of the impact his death had on the world and of the affection and esteem in which he was held. Comparing Kirov’s death to Kennedy’s gives a sense not just of the impact of his death but of the hopes for the future that people had invested in him; it also helps to underline the contrast between Kirov’s popular image and Stalin’s.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Montefiore drops little touches in to bring the scene to life: Nikolaev is ‘a dark-haired young man’ (the colour of his hair is not particularly significant but helps us envisage the scene); Nikolaev does not just follow Kirov, he ‘trailed along behind him’ – a more evocative image of an animal stalking his prey; Borisov, Kirov’s bodyguard, doesn’t just run up but ‘staggered up breathlessly’; Kirov’s body is not dead but ‘lifeless’, his head ‘lolling’. There is nothing remotely implausible about any of these images, but they do reflect how the historian’s choice of language is every bit as important in conveying a picture of the past as is his or her use of the source material. SourcesAlthough there are plenty of footnotes through the book, there are none for this particular section. However, there are references to Montefiore’s sources, some direct, others by inference. In the second paragraph he refers to the ‘conflicting evidence’ of the different witness statements, as in the exact position of the gun; indeed, it would be difficult to imagine constructing such a detailed reconstruction of events, even down to the exact way Kirov’s cap lay on the floor, without such statements to draw on. The third paragraph, about the doctors, is clearly also based on their evidence and notes: it is difficult to see otherwise how Montefiore could have known the exact time when they stopped giving Kirov artificial respiration.<< Commentaries ::  Lisa Jardine The Awful End of Prince William the Silent >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Marketing and advertising companies operate elaborate systems of data gathering and analysis to categorise people and work out how best to get them to part with their money; trying to construct a similar sort of profile for people who died long ago requires similar ingenuity. Queen Elizabeth once said she had no window to see into men’s souls; historians, however, need to construct just such a window because upon the deepest beliefs of ordinary people whole historical theories, interpretations and, indeed, reputations are built. Nowhere is this more true than in the history of religious belief. How can we actually know what people have believed in at different periods of history? Political historians can point to opinion polls and election results as evidence and while both have major flaws, they do at least involve people committing themselves to one side or the other of an issue. But does attendance at a particular church indicate a commitment to its beliefs? There are strong social pressures (sometimes including the law and threat of punishment) which can lead people to attend church even when they do not believe in God; some people might attend a particular church rather than another because it is nearer, even though they do not entirely hold to its doctrine; some might attend church out of curiosity or in a state of uncertainty; some might go through the motions, others might believe deeply in what they are doing. Until we can decode these patterns of behaviour, no historian can make any sort of judgement with confidence about whether or not (for example) ‘England was Catholic under Queen Mary’ or ‘medieval people lived in fear of Hell’ or ‘people took their opinions from the Church of England’.A better guide might be offered by people who change their religion. As long as this is done voluntarily (which is by no means always the case) this is usually a good indication of genuine belief; indeed, it is often said that the most zealous people within any particular religion are converts. Here too, however, the historian must tread carefully: conversion and excessive religious zeal can have a distorting effect and may reflect a reaction to other factors such as repression or poverty.The historian wanting to get at people’s beliefs must therefore exercise a certain degree of ingenuity, even lateral thinking, in finding the best clues. If attendance at worship is not enough on its own to determine people’s views, what about the place of worship itself? Do people pour out their deepest beliefs in journals, diaries or letters? Does fundraising for religious objectives provide reliable evidence? What about participation in pilgrimages or processions? What about protests against religious change, or should we pay more attention to those who did not protest? We may have the text of sermons congregations listened to, but can we be sure they listened, or if they did, that they understood? Sometimes the religious authorities have undertaken checks on the state of belief among their communities, but how much credence should be given to such official investigations? These extracts give two contrasting approaches that two historians have taken to this issue. Both have chosen a small village to investigate in depth, one in south western France at the end of the thirteenth century and the other in south western England in the sixteenth century.Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Montaillou >>Eamon Duffy, The Voices of Morebath >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He made his name with The Stripping of the Altars, an investigation into what people in the parishes of England and Wales really felt during the religious upheavals of Henry VIII and Edward VI’s reigns, when they were told to tear out their statues of saints, stop their pilgrimages and holy days and turn their backs on the monasteries. It had long been assumed that most English people, weary of the corruption and abuses of the medieval church, welcomed the new religious practices, were glad of the opportunity Protestantism offered to develop their own personal relationship with God, and that only a few recidivists in certain strongly Catholic areas, mainly in the north of England, rebelled against the changes or hankered after the old ways. In this, essentially whiggish, view of the period the development of the Protestant Church of England represented progress, the ‘course of history’, and Catholicism appeared as backward-looking, foreign and doomed to failure. The return to Roman allegiance which took place under the Catholic Queen Mary I (1553-1558) was thus traditionally seen as a period of cruel and pointless repression.Was this in fact how people at the time saw the religious changes? Did changes in religious policy, introduced by parliament or by royal decree, affect people’s religious beliefs. Is religious belief susceptible to change in that manner? Duffy’s approach to this issue was significantly different from that of most historians who had written on it, in that he did not confine himself to written material in archives, but went to look at the physical evidence in many English parish churches. There he found plenty of evidence which confuted the general interpretation and suggested that, far from welcoming the changes, the majority of people clung as tightly and as long as possible to the Catholic beliefs and rituals they had grown up with. The Stripping of the Altars was a good example of the use of local historical research to build up a national picture.The Voices of Morebath also uses local history, but in this case Duffy investigates the impact of the religious changes of the sixteenth century on one Devonshire village, Morebath, for which we have unusually full documentation thanks to its parish priest, Sir Christopher Trychay, who used the parish accounts book to keep a detailed record of the life of the village. However, there is more to Duffy’s treatment than simply a reconstruction of the religious life of this sixteenth century village. Sir Christopher’s detailed accounts were already well known to historians, especially local historians, but they had always been cited as evidence that Morebath simply accepted each change of religious policy and conformed with the latest pronouncements from London. However, Morebath’s story does not fit into that pattern, for in 1549 it was one of the villages that took part in a major rebellion that spread through Devon and Cornwall against the introduction of the Protestant Book of Common Prayer to replace the Catholic Mass. The rebellion was brutally suppressed and the whole episode was one of enormous trauma for the whole region. In The Voices of Morebath, therefore, using exactly the same evidence as earlier writers, Duffy argues that the previous interpretations were wrong and that the evidence shows Morebath conforming only very reluctantly to the changes in religion, keeping its traditional Catholic faith alive in any way that was possible.<< The Beliefs of the People ::   Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, the most noticeable point about Duffy’s use of language is that he has retained the original Tudor spellings: ‘a nimage’ (an image), ‘auter clotwhys’ (altar coths). The language of the original sources always poses a dilemma for historians: should they retain the original or render it into modern English? If the sources are in a foreign language, should they be translated and how will the accuracy of the translation be monitored? In the case of earlier versions of English, the situation is made more problematic because the language was not standardised and many people had their own variants of it. Sir Christopher Trychay, for example, tended to write ‘ys’ as a separate word after a name or noun to indicate the genitive: thus ‘John Wode ys brother’ means ‘John Wode’s brother’. The original conveys the sound and ‘feel’ of the original, but it risks putting off the reader or, perhaps, worse, sounding twee in a ‘Ye Olde Gifte Shoppe” way. Duffy decides on a qualified approach: he keeps the original spellings, giving a couple of useful hints in a preface, adds notes in square brackets for particularly difficult words (as with ‘purtenes’ in this extract) and adds a modern English version for any extended passage. He also adds, rightly, that the Tudor spelling ‘is less difficult to understand than may appear at first glance – readers who are daunted should try reading the passages aloud, and will be surprised how often the sense clarifies itself’.Like Montaillou this is a text dominated by one single original source, in this case The Accounts of the Wardens of the Parish of Morebath, Devon, 1520-1573 edited by J. Erskine Binney and published in Exeter in 1904 from where all the quotations in this passage come. The printed primary source is an essential tool for the historian: it consists of an original primary source which is transcribed and printed in book form, usually with extensive notes. However, as well as an extensive list of secondary material, Duffy’s bibliography also gives three pages of printed primary sources as well as manuscript sources he has looked at in different archives. Although the book is looking in detail at one village, it is not essentially a work of local history; looking at other sources enables the historian to extrapolate from Morebath and to use it to illustrate a more general case.<< Commentaries ::   Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Montaillou >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

One of the leading exponents of this approach was Fernand Braudel, who produced a monumental study of the Mediterranean world in the reign of Philip II of Spain, looking at the interplay between the geography of the region and the power struggle between Spain and the Ottoman Turks that raged across it. This school of history became known as the Annales school after the journal in which many of these historians published their research. A particularly good example of Annales history appeared with the publication in 1980 of the English translation of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie’s Montaillou.Montaillou was a small medieval village in south western France which at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries got caught up in the events surrounding the spread of a particular form of religious heresy known as Catharism, also known as Albigensianism after the town of Albi, which became its centre. Heresy is essentially orthodox doctrine that has been carried through in a way that deviates from the original beliefs. It was regarded with particular horror by the authorities in both church and state, not least because it was feared it would mislead many of the faithful and cause them to go to Hell, and a crusade was declared to wipe the Cathars out. This ‘Albigensian Crusade’ was fought out in the mountaintop villages of the foothills of the Pyrenees where the Cathars had their strongholds. After a series of sieges and brutal massacres the Cathars were crushed and an Inquisition was sent to the region to investigate just how far the heresy had extended. One of the places it visited was Montaillou.Contrary to popular lurid versions of history, the Inquisition was not a group of bloodthirsty characters gleefully torturing their victims; it was a legal department of the Church, staffed by lawyers, examining evidence carefully and carrying out detailed investigations into the causes behind outbreaks of heresy. Lawyers keep very full records and the Inquisition which visited Montailou in 1308 was no exception. The villagers were questioned in considerable detail, especially since it seemed to the Inquisition that the whole village was involved with Catharism. The result was a mass of documentation revealing, a host of details about even the most intimate aspects of the lives of the villagers. It was the Inquisition’s reports that Ladurie used to reconstruct the daily life of a medieval village in southern France.<< The Beliefs of the People :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The evidence suggests that some viewed her as of equal importance with the figure of Jesus, rather than as one interceding with him on their behalf.Adoration of the Virgin Mary is widespread in Catholic countries, though it is supposed to stop short of actual worship, which is reserved for God. If the villagers of Montaillou were indeed worshipping Mary, then it would be taken as evidence of the way their heretical views had departed from the Catholic norm.What we see here is an exercise in interpretation of evidence. Only Rixende Cortil appears to be talking directly and specifically about praying to the Virgin Mary, though the Testanières might be – one would need to know more precisely what question they were answering; the others all mention devotion to the Virgin in a slightly different context; Clergue the priest buries his mother, Béatrice de Planissoles is giving thanks after having a baby; the women of Sabathès are making exclamations at things that happen; Jean Maury reminds his brother to say the Pater Noster (‘Our Father’, the Lord’s Prayer) and the Ave Maria (‘Hail Mary’), the two most common prayers; the tavern customers in Foix are talking about the execution of a Waldensian (a member of another heretic sect). All of these people mention something relating to veneration for the Virgin and Ladurie, who is here on the look-out for evidence of precisely that, pounces on these references to develop his argument. With the exception of Rixende Cortil, the references to the Virgin are such as might have been found in any Catholic area at the time or indeed since; however Rixende does give evidence of a moment of conflict, when Guillemette Authié reprimands her for praying to the Virgin but Rixende ignores her. This is not proof in itself that prayer to the Virgin as a saviour (rather than asking her to intercede with Jesus) was common practice, especially as we do not know exactly what prayer Rixende was saying, but placed within a pattern of other examples of people honouring and turning to the Virgin Mary Ladurie argues that it could indicate that: ‘This idea was probably quite general, and included the actual Adoration of the Virgin’. He makes it clear where he thinks the evidence takes us without committing himself irrevocably.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

This, indeed, is one of the effects of the book on the reader: we learn so much about the people of Montaillou that it is as if we knew them. The wording of ‘though she might forget sometimes to go to Mass on Sunday’ has a tone of indulgence, while ‘did not neglect’ gives the sense that Ladurie is seeking to excuse her, setting her diligence in lighting the candle (which, he adds, she had made herself) against her occasional forgetfulness about going to Mass. The sense of friendly familiarity is enhanced by the use of first names for the characters, appropriate for the period and context, but nevertheless inviting the reader into the characters’ world rather more than is usual.Note also the careful use of provisional language. The passage begins with the apparently straightforward claim that elite honoured the Virgin; this is immediately qualified by ‘at least with external signs of piety’. Whether they actually honoured her in their hearts and minds Ladurie cannot know; he – and we – can only go on external evidence. Similarly ‘Sancta Maria’ ‘perhaps’ indicates the women’s devotion; or it might just be an exclamation, long since divorced from its original meaning. We know (from Jean Maury’s evidence) that some peasants prayed to the Virgin; ‘it may be’ that some of them knew the ‘Ave Maria’. Ladurie keeps strictly within the boundaries of his evidence.Montaillou is unusual (though not unique) in being so heavily based upon a single, albeit comprehensive, source, in this case the proceedings of the Inquisition. Ladurie takes care never to advance too far from his source: the numbers in brackets refer the reader to the precise references within it. He is careful too not to leap to conclusions, however tempting; not assuming, for example, that Rixende’s prayer was the Ave Maria. Where the original words are important to put across the feelings behind what is being described, as in Rixende’s proud boast ‘But I went on praying to Mary!’ he quotes directly from the record; otherwise he positions volume and page numbers within the text to support each reference to something in the original. This is an excellent example of how it is possible to build an account from a single source without simply rewriting it.<< Commentaries ::   Eamon Duffy, The Voices of Morebath >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The High Warden’s accounts show that a statue of the Virgin was named as an executor, and was presented with many intimate gifts as well as devotional services. Images of the Virgin and other associated aspects of the fabric of church buildings, such as candle brackets and tabernacles, continued to be bought, erected or repaired, well into the 1530s, the period of the Henrician Reformation.Duffy is here making a simple point, that the people of Morebath retained a special devotion to the Virgin Mary, but he makes it by piling on lots of reference to the evidence. Indeed, there is relatively little of Duffy’s own argument in this passage; most of it is taken up with a list of the various artefacts mentioned in Sir Christopher’s accounts which relate to veneration of the Virgin Mary. Duffy points to the importance of the language Sir Christopher uses and acknowledges that it might distort the significance of the objects he records – ‘the phrasing may well be the priest’s’ – but he says that the significance of the actual gifts made to the statue of the Virgin Mary is clear, regardless of Sir Christopher’s phrasing. After outlining the gifts in the first paragraph, Duffy then brings in other examples of Marian iconography, either newly made, restored or repaired. This answers any objection that might be made to the effect that he is making too much of devotion to one particular statue.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He might be better described as a 'man of letters' than a historian, although much of his writing was on historical topics. Indeed, he based his own work entirely on secondary sources and developed a deep hostility towards historians who took a more orthodox approach towards researching their work, arguing that fine factual accuracy was less important than getting at the heart and soul of the subject. His hostility towards orthodox historical writing grew so fierce that some have wondered whether his mind might not have been a bit unhinged on the subject.Carlyle's written style was highly characteristic, neither quite that of the novelist nor that of the historian, though with elements from both. He wrote breathlessly, as if commentating on events unfurling before his eyes, addressing some of the historical characters directly and very clearly taking sides: not for him the detached objectivity of the professional historian. He made his name with his vivid account of the French Revolution which was remarkable both for its florid writing style and for Carlyle's unorthodox stance on the events he described. Since it broke out in 1789, the French Revolution had provoked two broad schools of reaction in Britain. On the one hand were the radicals, of whom the most notable was Tom Paine, who welcomed the revolution, the overthrow of the monarchy and aristocracy and the establishment of a republic; indeed some were able to maintain their enthusiasm for the revolution even after the institution of the revolutionary Terror, which saw thousands of innocent people executed by guillotine. By the far the majority of British people, however, took a more hostile approach. They recognised the need for change in France and criticised the reluctance of the king to grant it, but they were appalled by the revolution itself, both because of its violence and because of the way it overturned the established order of society. This antirevolutionary attitude survived well into the nineteenth century and beyond and is perhaps best exemplified by the popularity of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities.Carlyle was not a radical in the normal sense of the word. He hated the industrial transformation of Britain and yearned nostalgically for an imagined (and largely imaginary) idyllic rural past. However, in The French Revolution he seems to revel in the violence of the events he describes and to welcome the destruction of the old order of society. Despite, or perhaps because of, its highly individual take on events in France, Carlyle's account was widely read and his name rightly belongs among the great writers of history in English, though he is perhaps more honoured than imitated.Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He is courteous, bold (one senses that his warning that he could pull De Launay off the rampart is no idle threat) and magnanimous: he warns the Invalides of what is likely to happen and it is not his fault that they take no notice. Carlyle also makes the crowd a character in itself, rolling forward from Saint-Antoine (one of the working-class districts of Paris, below the Bastille) ‘as one man’ or becoming collectively suspicious when Thuriot seems to have disappeared inside the Bastille for a long time. The crowd here represents the French people, goaded beyond endurance by a weak and ineffective regime, represented by De Launay, who dithers, plies his men with drink and, even when he finally gives the order to open fire, produces only ‘a slight sputter’, enough to kill people and inflame the crowd but not enough to deter them. Carlyle acts sometimes as narrator – ‘All morning, since nine, there has been a cry everywhere: To the Bastille!’ – and sometimes almost as participant, addressing Thuriot and De Launay: ‘’But outwards, behold, O Thuriot, how the multitude flows on’, ‘Wo to thee, De Launay…’ He also employs hindsight, hinting at later events that he knows but his characters cannot: his description of Thuriot looking down at the crowd from the ramparts talks of ‘other Phantasmagories, and loud-gibbering Spectral Realities, which thou yet beholdest not, but shalt!’, referring to similar scenes of angry crowds baying for blood which will come in the next few years.Even a reader unfamiliar with the period will probably have guessed that Carlyle’s is a highly romanticised version of events, especially if it is pointed out that the crowd will shortly tear De Launay and his men to pieces and parade through the streets with the governor’s head on a pike. The key to Carlyle’s interpretation lies in the phrase, subsequently much quoted, ‘Burst forth Insurrection, at sight of its own blood’. He has made a character, a sort of monstrous figure with head and limbs, not just of the crowd but of the very concept of insurrection, of popular uprising. Out of the character of the crowd grows the allegorical figure of Insurrection, of (the inference is clear) Revolution itself, a wounded monster, stung by the drunken Invalides and terrible therefore in its fury.<< What happens in this passage :: Language >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The fortress's governor, the Marquis De Launay, has to decide how to react as a representative of the crowd advances over the plank that has been placed over the fortress's defensive stone ditch to discuss surrender terms.<< Introduction :: What happens in this passage? >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Carlyle uses collective nouns to elevate and dignify the events, especially the actions of the crowd: ‘the multitude flows on’, ‘ever wider swells the tide of men’, even the ironic ‘new deputation of citizens (it is the third, and noisiest of all)’ to refer to the crowd bursting into the Outer Court. Significantly, Carlyle avoids the emotive term ‘mob’, even though that was the standard term used to describe the crowd, both when it was rioting, as here, and in its everyday existence on the outer fringes of society. Carlyle’s use of language creates vivid imagery, though it sometimes demands a second reading to bring out the full meaning.<< Commentary :: Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

One is led by Thuriot de la Rosière, who is let into the fortress. The crowd outside grows restless until Thuriot and De Launay show themselves up on the ramparts, where Thuriot notes cannon are prepared, loaded with grapeshot. The talks are fruitless, Thuriot leaves and De Launay, who does not understand what the crowd wants, has to decide whether or not to give the order to open fire on them. The outer drawbridge is lowered to let Thuriot leave and the crowd swarms across it. De Launay gives the order for some of his men to open fire and raises the drawbridge; however, some people are killed and the crowd rises in anger and besieges the Bastille.<< Extract ::   Commentary >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He might be better described as a 'man of letters' than a historian, although much of his writing was on historical topics. Indeed, he based his own work entirely on secondary sources and developed a deep hostility towards historians who took a more orthodox approach towards researching their work, arguing that fine factual accuracy was less important than getting at the heart and soul of the subject. His hostility towards orthodox historical writing grew so fierce that some have wondered whether his mind might not have been a bit unhinged on the subject.Carlyle's written style was highly characteristic, neither quite that of the novelist nor that of the historian, though with elements from both.

For much of the twentieth century western historians of the crusades worked within a broadly Christian social framework, in which the concept of crusade was a familiar paradigm, used in a wide range of contexts: ‘crusades’ would be launched against crime, squalor or poverty. The decline in the role of religion in western European society in the late twentieth century and especially the growth of substantial Muslim communities in Europe and North America has inevitably forced a rethinking of the crusades. Where once they were seen essentially in heroic terms, they tend now to be seen as aberrations, which demand apologies to the Muslim world by the modern leaders of the Church.This shift in public emphasis places the academic historian of the period in a difficult position. History rarely fits into such simplistic patterns and the crusades are no exception. Modern critics who compare the crusades to later European imperialism and who assume that the crusaders were out for material gain can be discomfited to learn that many crusaders who settled in the east were financially ruined by the experience. These two extracts look at one event, the fall of Jerusalem to the knights of the First Crusade, in 1099, in the words of two different Cambridge historians, who reflect something of the shift in approach that has taken place in recent years.

Like other scholars in the field, he has had to face up to the question of how one follows a popular and influential historian like Runciman. Modern historians of the Crusades have looked in greater depth than was fashionable in Runciman’s day at angles like the economics of Crusade or at Crusading beyond the Middle East; however modern historians have a duty to tell the story of the events just as much as Runciman did.<< Presenting a Crusade :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Despite the arrival of supplies from Genoa, England and Samaria, they were unable to break through the defences. They also heard that an expedition was heading north from Egypt to relieve the city. The Crusaders prepared for the final assault by constructing siege towers and engines, holding a penitential procession and hearing sermons on the Mount of Olives. Eventually Godfrey of Bouillon’s men broke through a gap in the wall and the city fell and was sacked.This is a vivid and detailed narrative account, written for a general audience. It is very much about the strategy of the siege: there is much talk of attacks from the west, north or south and the final breakthrough comes when Godfrey slightly changes his angle of attack. By the end, we get a day-by-day account of what happened when and on which exact part of the walls. Riley-Smith points out the divisions and splits within the Crusader camp: Raymond of St Gilles is 'bitterly at odds' with Godfrey of Bouillon, and one senses a certain rivalry between the two men in the description of how their different angles of attack crept closer to the city walls. The strategic detail rather squeezes out the other angles: one would like to know more about the visionary who persuaded the Crusaders to make a penitential procession around the city and to learn more about what this procession did.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He was a leading scholar in the history of Byzantium, still a field with which relatively few historians are familiar and to which a short introduction might be useful. Byzantium was the name of the Greek city upon which the Roman emperor Constantine founded his eastern capital, Constantinople. The name Byzantium survived and was often used for the Roman empire in the east, especially after the fall of the western Roman Empire. The Byzantine empire, though officially known as Roman, was essentially Greek in its culture and language; it was also a major centre of Christianity. It covered the Balkans in southern Europe, modern Turkey and the middle east, all of which, especially Turkey, also had a substantial Greek and Christian thread to its culture. By the eleventh century, however, the Byzantines were under pressure from the Turks, spreading westwards from central Asia and bringing Islam with them. In 1071 the Turks invaded the Byzantine Empire, defeating and killing the Byzantine emperor at the Battle of Manzikert. His successor called on western Europe for help to drive the Turks from his empire and that call was the origin of the crusades.Runciman was unusual in his interest in Byzantium: most historians of the Crusades concentrated on the western Europeans, with some specialising in the Arab side of the story. He then applied his knowledge of the Byzantines to his three-volume history of the crusades which he published in the 1950s. It rapidly became a popular-seller, not least because of Runciman’s dramatic narrative style. His mastery of the detail meant that his narrative was populated by a huge cast of characters, many of whose names will have sounded unfamiliar to his readers, and he revelled in the sort of intricate, complex plots which are often described as ‘Byzantine’.<< Presenting a Crusade :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The crusaders also massacred the city’s Jews, suspecting them of having helped the Muslims. Later, many Christians were appalled at the bloodshed; it also alienated those Muslims who might have been ready to work with the crusaders, enraging the Muslim world so much that it became impossible to find a peaceful way forward.This is a vivid description of an appalling event, and although Runciman avoids giving gruesome details of any individual’s fate, the general picture is fairly clear, especially when he describes Raymond of Aguilers picking his way through corpses with blood coming up to his knees. On the face of it, this is a straightforward narrative account, similar in style to a medieval chronicle: Runciman appears to be telling us the events without comment; in fact his view comes through very clearly from his choice of language. Although for most of the passage we are seeing events through Runciman’s eyes as they unfurl, at the end we are reminded that, unlike his characters, he knows what will follow and he uses his hindsight to invite the reader to condemn the killings even more strongly.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

His language is straightforward and unambiguous – ‘The building was set on fire and they were all burnt within’ – which renders it particularly effective. He balances the reference to Christian fanaticism with a reference to ‘the fanaticism of Islam’, making it clear he approves of neither; however, the second was the product of the first. ‘Fanaticism’ is not a neutral, technical term: it implies disapproval; this becomes very clear when he speaks of ‘wiser Latins in the East’ who seek to build bridges to the Muslims. The fact that these wise people are frustrated by the memory of the Jerusalem massacres simply adds to the enormity of what was done.Runciman gives a good spread of precise references in his footnotes, all of them primary sources and including a number of Arab historians. This reliance on going back to the original chronicles was typical of his thorough approach to scholarship and lent his work much of its authority. In this case, the footnote, by supporting his account of the Crusaders’ violence, reinforces the reader’s reaction to the event. The reference to Ibn al-Athir giving Raymond of Aguilers credit for having kept his word to spare the people of the city works both to Raymond’s credit and to Ibn al-Athir’s, since it shows him to be scrupulously fair to his opponents, even I the face of atrocity. It helps to underline the treacherous nature of the Crusaders’ crime.<< Commentaries ::   Jonathan Riley-Smith The Crusades: A Short History >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The description becomes florid towards the end of the passage, when, after the first few knights have passed through the breach ‘the trickle became a torrent’ with Crusaders pouring over the wall. However, perhaps the biggest surprise comes right at the end of this passage when the violence that Runciman described in such detail is encapsulated in the phrase ‘Jerusalem was given over to the sack’. This is a euphemism much used by historians as a way of indicating what happened without having to go into details; it should be remembered that Riley-Smith is trying to cover the whole history of the Crusades in a single book, whereas Runciman had three volumes at his disposal. Even so, it is worth considering the effectiveness of such phrases on conveying the reality of events in the past.In a work of this kind references to sources are generally few. Riley-Smith does not refer here in any direct sense to any of his sources. However, this is an example of historical writing where the very detail of the narrative is itself evidence of the research that has gone into it. This comes through the detailed description of the different angles of attack and from the day-by-day account in the last period before the city is taken. Two details point more directly to detailed research: the reference to ‘the desertion of Tancred and probably of others of his following’ suggests that, although the precise evidence is lacking, it is a fair inference the evidence we have that others had gone with him; the positioning of the final breakthrough ‘slightly to the east of the present-day Herod’s Gate’ suggests first-hand familiarity with the site, in other words fieldwork<< Commentaries ::   Sir Steven Runciman A History of the Crusades >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

But if the past itself has gone, it has left a vast amount of material behind from which historians construct their versions of it. For any age beyond living memory this material will be physical evidence, and from it historians construct a pattern of events which, they contend, actually happened. Historians usually do this with a certain degree of confidence, even if the evidence base is fairly small. For example, a historian might find, tucked away in a local newspaper, a review of a village pantomime in 1931. It might appear to be an example of resilience at local level during the difficult years of the Depression or an indication of the uses to which the village halls erected after the First World War were actually put. However, unless the historian were studying the village in detail, it is unlikely that he or she would seek corroborating evidence of the performance: there is nothing particularly startling in the idea of a village pantomime and we have no ostensible reason to assume the local paper would make such a thing up. The historian is thus presenting this pantomime as an event, as something that happened.But how do historians decide which, among the thousands of facts they encounter, to marshal in support of their arguments? This issue was brought into new prominence in the early 1960s when Professor G. Kitson Clark gave a series of lectures at Oxford about The Making of Victorian England. He took a broad-brush approach, looking at British society in the first decades of Victoria’s reign, supporting his imagery with examples culled from his reading of court records, newspapers and so on, as one would expect of a historian with in-depth knowledge of the period. The following year, however, his work was latched onto in an unexpected way in a series of lectures given in Cambridge by Professor E.H. Carr, an eminent historian of the Soviet Union. Carr’s point related not to the Victorian subject matter but to Kitson Clark’s selection and use of his factual material. G. Kitson Clark: The Making of Victorian England >>E.H.

Much of its argument has long since passed out of current thinking and, on its own, it is perhaps an inadequate introduction to historiography, as Carr would doubtless have been the first to admit. However, it is a good place to start, and the link between Kitson Clark’s lectures and Carr’s provides us with a useful point of entry.Historiography consists partly of the study of historians and partly of the study of historical method, the study of the study of history. Many eminent historians have turned their hand to it, reflecting on the nature of the work they undertake and its relationship both to the reader and to the past. Carr was a well-known authority on the history of Soviet Russia, with which he was in ideological sympathy. Invited to deliver the 1961 George Macaulay Trevelyan lectures, he chose as his theme the question ‘What is History?’ and sought to undermine the idea, then very much current, that historians enjoy a sort of objectivity and authority over the history they study. At one point he pictured the past as a long procession of people and events, twisting and turning so that different ages might look at each other with greater or lesser clarity. He warned, however, against the idea that the historian was in any sort of commanding position, like a general taking the salute; instead the historian is in the procession with everyone else, commenting on events as they appear from there, with no detachment from them nor, of course, any idea of what events might lie in the future. This assault on the privileged authority of the historian was bold for its time, particularly in a series of lectures named after such a whiggish figure as Trevelyan. But if few historians with quibble with his basic premise about the historian’s position vis-à-vis the past, his thoughts on the definition of a historical fact were far more contentious. << The Uses of Facts ::  Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

For the one to become the other it must be taken up by historians and pass into general use in their discourse about the past. The incident at Stalybridge Wakes has been taken up by Kitson Clark but has not yet passed into general use and cannot therefore yet be accepted as historical fact. That will in turn depend upon whether or not historians agree with, or accept as valid, the general interpretation in support of which Kitson Clark originally used it.This distinction between ‘facts about the past’ and ‘historical facts’ is very much Carr’s own and is not one which has generally troubled historians, nor one that they have been inclined to accept. Ironically, it was Carr’s very citing of this not-yet-a-fact that elevated it into an undeniable ‘fact of history’, to sue Carr’s term, because this example has been seized upon so often by historians and students discussing Carr’s book, rather than Kitson Clark’s. Indeed, the rather lofty role that Carr ascribes to the historian, deciding not only which facts to use but which shall gain admittance to Carr’s ‘select club’, runs directly counter to his argument elsewhere in his lectures that the historian is not superior to the facts but is in there with them. << Extract ::   Language & Sources>>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Carr’s use of the personal pronoun here emphasises his authority, not only over his material but also over his audience, just as a lecturer will often refer to ‘my lecture’, claiming ownership over it and keeping the audience in a subordinate, listening role. Carr’s language stresses the historian’s superior position: ‘Lord’ George Sanger, the circus-owner, though ‘an eye-witness’ to the murder at Stalybridge, cannot be considered on a par with the historian: his book is described, dismissively, as ‘some little-known memoirs’. Historians ‘rescue’ ‘mere’ facts from ‘the limbo of unhistorical facts about the past’, propose them for membership of an august club, and decide among themselves, through their footnotes, articles and books, whether they shall be admitted.Only two sources are cited in this passage, and those are the ones we would expect: Kitson Clark’s original lectures and the circus-owner’s memoirs, which Carr calls little-known, but which seem to have run into a second edition and which he has certainly been able to track down. Moreover, he is not above changing the details of his sources. Kitson Clark said that the gingerbread-seller was kicked to death by miners (he does not say how many, though since they were equipped for the business, it need not have been many), that they wore steel-capped clogs, and that two policeman turned up. Carr omits nearly all these details, though he mentions the place and the fact that the victim sold gingerbread. The miners of the original have become ‘an angry mob’, which Kitson Clark did not claim; moreover, Carr has added a detail that Kitson Clark did not, that it was ‘the result of some petty dispute’; ‘some’ suggests that Carr does not actually know what the issue had been even though he gives the original account in his footnote. For the rest of the passage, for all his claims about how historians operate and decide what shall and what shall not be considered historical facts, Carr gives no sources at all. << Commentaries ::   G.

He had made his name with his work on two major nineteenth-century political campaigning movements, Chartism and the Anti-Corn Law League and the Oxford invitation enabled him to expand on his theme to look at the wider issue of Victorian. The published lecture, a medium in which Kitson Clark specialised, is a different form of writing from an academic article or a book. In its concern to communicate with a listening, rather than primarily a reading, audience it is something of a return to the style of Roman writers like Tacitus and Suetonius. To a greater degree than in a book, the author is persuading the audience, winning them over to his or her own interpretation. << The Uses of Facts ::  Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

They could not control campaigns of intimidation like attacks on turnpikes in Wales or rick-burning in England, nor could they contain the regular outbursts of violence that happened when crowds gathered, especially if they had been drinking. George Sanger, a circus owner, gives one example of a stallkeeper kicked to death by a group of miners at a fair which was only investigated by the police in a very desultory manner.Kitson Clark is setting out here to undermine the popular conception of Victorian England as an ordered, even picturesque society. Most of us already have a fairly gritty picture of life in the working class districts of the cities, of course, but there is a tendency to romanticise nineteenth-century rural life, so it is significant that his examples of violence are drawn from the countryside or from small towns. His examples of targeted violence, rick-burning in England and the Rebecca Riots in Wales (so called from the rioters’ practice of using women’s dresses as a disguise), might be thought exceptions, prompted by very specific issues, but the reference to numerous reports of violence in the newspapers gives the idea that it violence was a common occurrence. The reference to the police appearing to regard the murder at Stalybridge supports this implication. << Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The sight of a group of men in disguise, with firearms, attacking an isolated and defenceless turnpike-keeper’s cottage would be intimidating and frightening in the extreme (one thinks of modern bank robberies or assaults by angry motorists on traffic wardens or wheel clampers), but this reality is to some extent masked by the matter-of-fact tone of ‘armed bands dressed as women broke down the gates and drove off the gatekeepers’. The more detached tone lends Kitson Clark authority, though either party involved in the riots might think it does them less than justice. Elsewhere, his language to some extent smoothes over the violence he is discussing. He describes the authorities dealing with political violence ‘with ease, and so with humanity’; what, one might wonder, might have been the reality behind that rather throw-away phrase. It certainly sounds as if Kitson Clark is looking kindly on the authorities. On the other hand there is a touch of admiration for the rioters in the reference to a ‘spirited guerrilla campaign’, which suggests a certain level of organisation and co-ordination, though ‘the wilder streets of the towns’ might be thought a rather colourful description of a pretty grim and intimidating reality.Kitson Clark makes it clear in his footnote where he has found the information that he is using, which appear to be detailed studies as different aspects of Victorian law and order. These in turn will be based on archival research. It is quite usual for such detailed works, which might not have much appeal to a general readership, to provide the examples upon which historians draw when writing for a broader readership. He also highlights some of his sources in the text (remember that this was originally a lecture, so his audience could not see the footnotes): he has got the details about arson attacks from Home Office papers, other reports of violence from newspapers and the detail of the attack on the gingerbread stallholder from the published memoirs of a circus owner, a man whose way of life took round the country a good deal. We might note that he does not give precise references in his footnotes for any of these sources he mentions; had he been writing a book chapter rather than a lecture he would have been expected to do this. He says quite openly that this evidence has not been subjected to any sort of statistical analysis. The claim that no such calculation has been made (by anyone) might be thought a way round the admission that he has not attempted it himself, as might his assertion that ‘probably no satisfactory calculation would be possible’. In fact, just such quantitative analyses of crime figures are standard practice among social and economic historians and became so even before the invention of computers; however, this sort of work within historical research lay in the future at the time Kitson Clark was writing << Commentaries ::   E.H.

But if the past itself has gone, it has left a vast amount of material behind from which historians construct their versions of it. For any age beyond living memory this material will be physical evidence, and from it historians construct a pattern of events which, they contend, actually happened. Historians usually do this with a certain degree of confidence, even if the evidence base is fairly small. For example, a historian might find, tucked away in a local newspaper, a review of a village pantomime in 1931. It might appear to be an example of resilience at local level during the difficult years of the Depression or an indication of the uses to which the village halls erected after the First World War were actually put. However, unless the historian were studying the village in detail, it is unlikely that he or she would seek corroborating evidence of the performance: there is nothing particularly startling in the idea of a village pantomime and we have no ostensible reason to assume the local paper would make such a thing up. The historian is thus presenting this pantomime as an event, as something that happened.But how do historians decide which, among the thousands of facts they encounter, to marshal in support of their arguments? This issue was brought into new prominence in the early 1960s when Professor G. Kitson Clark gave a series of lectures at Oxford about The Making of Victorian England. He took a broad-brush approach, looking at British society in the first decades of Victoria’s reign, supporting his imagery with examples culled from his reading of court records, newspapers and so on, as one would expect of a historian with in-depth knowledge of the period. The following year, however, his work was latched onto in an unexpected way in a series of lectures given in Cambridge by Professor E.H. Carr, an eminent historian of the Soviet Union. Carr’s point related not to the Victorian subject matter but to Kitson Clark’s selection and use of his factual material. G. Kitson Clark: The Making of Victorian England >>E.H.

Britain’s rise to power and status, especially its acquisition of a global empire, meant that the British got used to an image of the world in which they were either superior or at any rate not innately inferior to others; one of the most significant national ideas to come out of the eighteenth century experience was the popular refrain to Thomas Arne’s Rule Britannia, declaring that ‘Britons never shall be slaves’. In Captives Linda Colley looks at the long history of Britons who were exactly that: slaves and captives. This produces a side of history that we are not used to seeing: villagers captured and carried off into slavery by Arab raiders along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall; Britons captured in tribal raids in the backwoods of colonial America or forced into the service of Indian princes. In many ways, reading Captives can be a sobering experience; it certainly adds some intriguing twists to the traditional narrative of British history.<< New Fields of Study :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He had put down a mutiny with unusual brutality, using Africans to administer severe floggings to the mutineers. He fled to the Continent but was arrested on his return to England, despite his family connections and the passage of twenty years.Colley is at pains to stress here that Wall was a man of high social standing, in order to stress that even this could not save him from the anger and opprobrium of his countrymen, at all levels of society. She begins with the hanging and with the crowds apparently heartless response: she stresses that usually a long drawn-out death would elicit sympathy but that this did not happen in his case. This all helps to arouse the reader’s curiosity: who is this man? What had he done to cause him to be so hated? She then disposes of a few possibilities: he is neither a burglar nor a child murderer nor a rapist and his main victim does not sound a likely victim at all, a tough army sergeant. She then makes it clear that Wall was no innocent: he was only posted to a tough place like Goree because his bad temper and conduct made him unsuitable to be posted anywhere else. What she does say explicitly, but leaves to the reader to infer, is the actual reason for Wall’s execution. We know that savage flogging was commonplace in the army and navy at the time and that it was not unknown for men to die from it; we may also be aware that mutiny carried the death sentence anyway. The clue comes when Colley reveals, through quotation from a contemporary account of the case, that what caused the anger was the use of rope rather than a standard whip and the fact that the flogging was administered by African slaves. This offers an intriguing reversal of the usual picture of the west African slave coast, in which Africans are whipped by their captors; the image is made more striking by Wall’s quoted encouragement to the Africans. We can therefore infer that it was this inversion of the usual racial hierarchy, rather than the flogging itself, which set opinion in Britain so firmly against Governor Wall. Thus Colley has taken an obscure incident and presented it to the reader as a paradigm for Britain’s whole imperial experience.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

She might have used more decorous words like ‘urinating’ and ‘excreting’ but this could have served to disguise the appalling nature of the torment Armstrong went through; this use of the vernacular in an academic account adds to its impact. Elsewhere, Colley’s use of language is more subtle but it serves to entice the reader towards her interpretation. There is a disapproval in her description of Wall’s ‘affluent, unfailingly well-nourished existence’; her sympathies are clear in the description of Newgate prison as ‘a site normally given over to executing the underprivileged’ – note the choice of adjective where the word ‘criminal’ might have been expected; while the crowd itself displays hypocritical ‘voyeuristic pity’. The point underlying the incident she focuses on is ‘to lay bare some of the more paradoxical captivities and costs involved in the expansion and exercise of British Empire’, where slaves whip their guards and the jailers are as much captives as those they guard. Notice that she speaks of ‘British Empire’ in an abstract sense, rather than ‘the British Empire’; it suggests that Empire was existed in the mind as well as in its more concrete political sense.Colley tells us in her footnote that she is drawing on two contemporary accounts of the case, one a description of the trial and the other based on Wall’s own memoirs. For the most part she simply draws the facts of the case form these accounts and presents them to us in her own words and structure, but she does add touches of her own gloss to bring out more clearly the implications of the text. Goree’s garrison, for example, is described as made up of ‘regiments in disgrace for mutiny, deserting … or some such cause’. This would have conveyed a fairly clear picture to the original readers, but Colley adds a rider for a modern readership, explaining that these were ‘hard men with no alternatives and no future’; this also helps the reader get a good picture of the confrontation and its brutal aftermath.<< Commentaries ::   E.M.

For many years this area of study was out of fashion, associated with the triumphalism and jingoism of the heyday of empire. However the revival of interest in the empire has drawn a very different set of parameters for its study. Instead of tracing the rise of British greatness, the new generation of imperial historians are drawn towards a postcolonialist approach, looking at the experience of empire from different angles, most notably that of the colonised people.Even the study of the colonisers has undergone an important shift of emphasis. Where once historians would recount the policy and military decisions of colonial administrators, there is now much more interest in the social history of those who built and maintained the British Empire. Elizabeth Collingham’s book Imperial Bodies is a good example of the genre. Based on her PhD thesis, it looks at the experience of colonial life in India through an examination of its impact on the bodies of the colonisers. It has often been noted that the British in the tropics refused to adapt their mode of cress to the climate except to wear lightweight versions of what they wore at home. They were also fastidious about maintaining a physical difference between themselves and the Indians: there were various spaces in colonial society which were barred to Indians.<< New Fields of Study :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, the technological deficiencies of Indian bathrooms meant that Indian servants had to perform many functions that were carried out mechanically in Britain, so that Indian bathrooms never became private spaces in the way that bathrooms in Britain were and Indian servants could gain detailed and intimate knowledge of their British masters and mistresses.Life in British India produced huge numbers of memoirs and journals which are a mine of information for historians. Collingham has used some of these to glean the details she puts into this passage. There is no denying that some of the details, not least the nickname ‘thunderbox’ for a rudimentary latrine, are likely to amuse but Collingham is pursuing a more serious purpose here. She is investigating not so much the details of how nineteenth-century Anglo-Indians washed and relieved themselves so much as how they defined their own personal space within their houses. The investigation of concepts of space is an important aspect of social history, and has been particularly revealing within a colonial context where racial considerations overlapped with the long-established class and gender criteria for the division of space. Here she takes the bathroom, the place where one might have expected absolute privacy, to show that not only was this not the case but that this had an impact upon the relationship between the colonisers and their subject people. The point of the little reference at the end about the sweeper (a very low, menial position) who might know the memsahib (mistress) was pregnant before she knew it herself is not just to raise a smile (which it no doubt does) but to show that Indian servants could use the knowledge they gained through their access to the inner space of the European home and spread it among the locals. This in turn suggests that the power balance between coloniser and colonised could be tipped, even by the most humbly situated servants, to the advantage of the latter.<< Extract ::   Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Central to these is the extended passage she quotes from John Masters’ 1951 account of life in India Bugles and a Tiger. To judge from his language, Masters is writing to fascinate, horrify and amuse his audience, especially those who have never been to India. He takes care to disabuse his readers from the outset of any misconceptions that an Indian toilet might resemble the sort of toilets they are used to. He lightly mentions the idea that openings for water could also let in snakes (readers might think he was joking, but in fact this could and did happen) and the ending of the passage leaves everything to the imagination: the sahib (master) might adjust his dress and leave without a further thought; we know, however, that the menial servant he has summoned will then have the distasteful task of emptying the ‘thunderbox’. Masters invites us to smile at the sahib’s conduct, but no more; the tone remains one of wry amusement.Collingham refers extensively to her sources, either directly or indirectly. Most of these are memoirs, though she also quotes from a biography of Lord Curzon, the viceroy. She has used the sources to isolate passages and passing references to bathing and going to the toilet, turning the sources very much to her particular purpose. The passage from Masters dates, as she points out, from a much later period than she is writing about, but she offers it as evidence on the basis that little had really changed. This is a perfectly legitimate use of source material, as long as the assumption it is based upon – that the evidence is still relevant to the earlier period – has taken into account any changes that had taken place in the interim.<< Commentaries ::  Niall Ferguson Virtual History >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

In 1997, however, Niall Ferguson edited a collection of essays that launched the idea of counterfactual history on the world.The famous historian F.W. Maitland once remarked that historians should always remember that events which are now in the past were once in the future. This was not just a warning against hindsight; it was also pointing out that at any point in the past, the path events actually took was only one of a number of possible paths that they could have taken. Historians often remind readers of this; the Duke of Wellington himself remarked that the Battle of Waterloo was a close-run thing and that it could easily have gone the other way. However Ferguson went much further than historians had done before and edited a set of essays that posited a number of counterfactuals and then tried to imagine how history might have been different. These ‘what if?’s included a royalist victory in the English Civil War, a settlement of the grievances of the American colonists which meant they did not need to declare themselves independent, a Nazi invasion of Britain and a President Kennedy who was not assassinated.<< New Fields of Study :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The knowledge that Britain successfully defied Hitler in 1940 is deeply ingrained in the British collective consciousness, so it is an audacious act to overturn it in this way. He turns our expectations on their heads throughout the passage: Hitler ignores ‘Anglo-America’; Austrian troops march into Berlin (rather than Germans into Vienna, as actually happened); Hitler meets not Chamberlain but Attlee; the British know nothing of tanks (in reality, a British invention). Ferguson sprinkles just enough real history – the invasions of Poland and France, the subjection of Bohemia and Moravia – to keep us in touch with reality, before confounding expectations again.Counterfactual history is a controversial topic and by no means all historians see any value in it whatsoever. It is one thing to say that Britain faced the possibility of German invasion and conquest in 1940 – no historian would deny it – and one might even use captured German plans or the German record in other occupied countries to speculate on what a German occupation of Britain might have been like; it is quite a different matter, however, to build up an entirely imaginary narrative based on not one but a number of counterfactuals. It might be said that to create one counterfactual makes it necessary in due course to create many more; critics say that this proves their point.

Instead of saying these events could have happened, he narrates them as if they did happen; he even imagines other historical controversies about them. He also slips on one or two mischievous touches: Britain is now part of ‘Anglo-America’ and Hitler has united Europe into a ‘European Union’, an obvious joke at the expense of the real European Union, of which Ferguson does not approve.It might be thought that one could hardly have sources for a fictional historical account, but in fact the essays in the book carry long and impressive bibliographies: they have to keep their speculations within reasonable and plausible bounds. However, Ferguson’s own contribution, the spoof narrative history from which this passage comes, does not have footnotes. He is taking his contributors essays and weaving them together into this ‘alternative’ history of the 1930s-40s. He certainly does weave them together; how plausible the end result is, remains open to discussion.<< Commentaries ::   Linda Colley Captives >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Across the floor of the House of Commons and House of Lords some of the great titans of Britain’s political history have clashed. Many historians have written about parliament. This section considers the treatment of two major figures in British politics in the early twentieth century by two different but popular historians, George Dangerfield and A.J.P. Taylor. Politicians dream of achieving a landslide election victory and in 1906 just such a triumph happened to the Liberal Party, one of the two great political parties of the Victorian era, which had achieved greatness under Mr Gladstone and now seemed set to do so again under a new generation of leaders. But Britain in the early years of the twentieth century was going through a period of unrest and conflict as great as the difficult years after Waterloo and which would perhaps not be matched again until the divisions of the Thatcher period in the 1980s. Industry was riven by major strikes, Ireland seemed on the brink of rebellion and civil war, the Suffragette movement was producing scenes of ever escalating violence, and all the while Britain’s relations with Germany were deteriorating as the First World War drew ever closer.In the end it was the First World War that killed off the old Liberal Party. It went into the war under the leadership of Herbert Asquith, but as the war got bogged down into the agony of the trenches the Liberal Party split and Asquith was toppled in a political coup engineered by his own cabinet colleague, the War Minister and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George.These two extracts present two suitably different views of these two very different types of Liberal Prime Minister.George Dangerfield The Strange Death of Liberal England >>A.J.P.

Dangerfield was a journalist rather than an academic historian and he had an eye both for a good story and for the most effective way to tell it. There is an honourable tradition of journalists and politicians writing works of history, often of very high quality. The Labour politician and leader of the Social Democratic Party Roy Jenkins produced major studies of Churchill and Gladstone, the former Conservative leader William Hague has produced very well-received biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce, and the BBC journalist Mark Urban has developed a speciality in the military history of Wellington’s armies in the Peninsular War. Dangerfield’s is perhaps different from other journalistic ventures into history in that he retained a very strong flavour of newspaper reporting in his text, but his work was widely admired among historians when it appeared in 1935 and was often cited as a work which had inspired people to take up the study of history.Dangerfield’s thesis challenged the then current theory that the Liberal Party was alive and well until the First World War imposed intolerable strains upon it. His view was that not only the Liberal Party but the very idea of Liberalism itself was cracking under the strain of internal crises even before 1914. Historians have argued about the validity of the 'Dangerfield thesis' and the consensus now is that he overstated his case and that both the Liberal Party and the internal cohesion of the nation were in better shape than he allows for by the time war intervened in 1914. But however much one might differ from his interpretation, there is no denying the force of his prose.<< Two Liberal Prime Ministers ::   Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

It describes a small but clearly very telling moment in the course of the debate and the impact of the last sentence, stuck out on its own away from the main text, helps to engender in the reader something of the same horror that Dangerfield describes affecting the MPs. It is an imaginative reconstruction: Dangerfield has no way of knowing whether Asquith, in is own mind, was addressing the miners rather than the House, nor can he know if everyone in the House was actually ‘fascinated and appalled’. Yet at the same time, for all its tone of imaginative invention, this scene also rings true. We know something of the immense strain Asquith was under, such that might well reduce even a politician to tears. Asquith was something of a sentimental figure, often falling hopelessly in love with much younger women and even writing love letter during Cabinet meetings, so there is nothing implausible in the scene Dangerfield describes. Given what we know of attitudes at the period, it is not difficult to imagine that MPs would indeed have been both fascinated by the spectacle of the Prime Minister weeping at the despatch box and appalled by it at the same time.Perhaps because his journalistic background gives him greater freedom of manoeuvre, Dangerfield here brings out an important aspect of historical writing which is not addressed often enough: the interplay between strict observance of historical facts and evidence, and the necessary exertion of the historian’s imagination. The historical record is always incomplete; in any case, sometimes we want to know things of the past that, by their nature, were never likely to be recorded in the first place. In such cases disciplined imagination, in line with the evidence, is required and here Dangerfield employs it to very good effect.<< Extract ::   Language >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The image is maintained in the next sentence as Dangerfield considers the different audiences Asquith has in mind. He then describes Asquith’s manner of speaking, twice describing him as ‘begging’, first the miners and then Parliament. Much of the central body of the passage comes from Asquith’s own words, preserved in Hansard, the official record of proceedings in Parliament, but Dangerfield manages to take them over by describing the manner in which Asquith delivers them, hesitating between words and speaking in ‘low thick halting tones’. Effectively Dangerfield places the reader in the same position as the MPs, watching the Prime Minister, waiting to see where his speech is going, until that final image that ends both the passage and its chapter section in the book. << Commentaries ::   A.J.P.

He had started out researching modern European history, especially the Habsburg Empire, on which he wrote a book in 1948 which is still widely used. Taylor was a familiar figure in the literary world and he did not confine his writing to academic audiences: he wrote articles in the popular press commenting on current events from a historical perspective and he was the first ‘telly don’, giving talks to camera on major issues in modern European history, explaining without patronising. This annoyed the more snobbish elements in academic circles and Taylor was never able to get the professorial chair at Oxford which might otherwise have been his due. Taylor had a mischievous streak and delighted in shocking orthodox historical opinion: his 1961 study of the Origins of the Second World caused outrage for appearing to take some of the blame off Hitler’s shoulders. A leading supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, he admired figures in history who had stirred things up; his favourite among his own works was a study of English radicals called The Troublemakers.Fresh from the controversy over The Origins of the Second World War Taylor was approached by the Clarendon Press to write a twentieth century volume to bring the venerable Oxford History of England up to date. The series was well established and included some volumes which are still highly regarded today, but its style was traditional and tended to be rather heavy; Taylor said he tried to read the whole series in preparation for his task but had to give up on some of them. His volume, English History 1914-1945, proved a great success. It had plenty of examples of Taylor’s characteristically provocative statements and paradoxes.<< Two Liberal Prime Ministers ::   Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He had a dynamic style of leadership though he himself often suffered from nerves. He did not like being opposed and he had a wide range of enemies, real or imagined. He was disloyal to his friends and so became increasingly isolated. He was devious and unprincipled in his dealings both with money and with women.Taylor is here writing for a general readership, many of whom would have remembered Lloyd George and would certainly have known of the events and people he refers to here. This means that Taylor can mention people like Northcliffe and Addison on the assumption that his readers will know who they were; he does the same with the Duke of Grafton, an eighteenth century Prime Minister. He also uses his readers’ knowledge against them, by deliberately confounding expectations. The idea of ‘a revolution, British-style’ goes against most people’s understanding of twentieth century Britain; the proposition that Lloyd George operated as a dictator during the war years is less new – as Taylor points out, Balfour used the term of him at the time – but the idea of Lloyd George as timid and nervous, his shirt drenched in nervous sweat, will again confound most readers’ expectations of a man usually seen as the embodiment of bumptious self-confidence.Taylor, on the other hand, shows no sign of timidity. His judgements are very clear-cut and both historical and moral. To call Lloyd George’s accession ‘a revolution’ is a historical judgement; to say that Lloyd George ‘had no friends and did not deserve any’ is more of a moral judgement. There is a debate to be had on where a historian’s proper duty lies and whether such moral judgements fall within it.<< Extract :: Language & Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

As a man of radical views with an eye for mischief, Lloyd George was exactly the sort of politician Taylor might have been thought to like.AJP Taylor, English History 1914-1945 (Oxford University Press 1965) p.73 1Dugdale Balfour ii p.170.2Sir Almeric Fitzroy, clerk to the privy council, Memoirs ii p.191.3These breakfasts increased Robertson’s dislike of Lloyd George. Lloyd George sat long. The habits of a lifetime made Robertson wish to withdraw at once. Hankey The Supreme Command ii, p.775.4On New Year’s Day 1917 the king made Haig a field marshal, as a gesture against Lloyd George.5Ninety-eight Liberals revealed themselves as against Lloyd George in the vote after the Maurice debate. It by no means followed that the remaining 170 were for him. In Nov. 1918 the Coalition Liberal whips claimed to have 150 followers. See below p.126.6Churchill stood unflinchingly by Lloyd George in 1913 at the time of the Marconi scandal. Lloyd George allowed Churchill to be saddled with all the blame for Gallipoli and said (quite untruly): ‘Churchill is the man who brought Turkey into the war against us.’Addison helped to make Lloyd George prime minister. After the war Lloyd George offered him as a scapegoat when there was an outcry against ‘homes for heroes’.7Lloyd George War Memoirs iv p.2274. << Introduction ::   Commentaries >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He was fond of the short, striking phrase – ‘The dynamite exploded’; ‘He did not lead a party’; ‘He had no friends and did not deserve any’ – which would often stick in the reader’s mind more successfully than longer, more reasoned arguments. He also makes effective use of memorable imagery, such as Lloyd George discussing policy over breakfast (this image is made even better by the footnote, which adds the spectacle of General Robertson sitting there, itching to get away). His sentences are generally short and to the point: ‘The party magnates and the whips had been defied’; ‘Lloyd George was not a man of plan and system’. The generally simple language means that when Taylor does permit himself a more florid touch it stands out all the more effectively: ‘he trembled before he acted’; ‘He was surrounded by dependants and sycophants’; ‘His rule was dynamic and sordid at the same time’; and the sexual imagery of ‘he remained also “the Goat”’.Taylor cites a number of sources to support his analysis here. Some are quoted in the text, such as Balfour’s comment on Lloyd George or the ‘detached observer’ identified in the footnote as Sir Almeric Fitzroy, clerk to the privy council and thus a high-ranking career civil servant. Others are cited in order to add a little colour which might have been difficult to fit neatly into the main body of text, as with the revelation from the memoirs of Sir Maurice Hankey (later Secretary to the Cabinet) about Robertson’s dislike of the long meetings over breakfast. These are all taken from the sort of sources we should expect a historian looking at high politics to consult, namely political memoirs and biographies. Note however that on occasion Taylor avoids giving his source. The detail in the footnote that the King made Haig a Field Marshal on New Year’s Day 1917 is a matter of record (i.e. one can check it in standard works of reference, including the Times); however, the detail that it was done as a gesture against Lloyd George is a judgement for which one would need further evidence. Taylor does not provide any, nor even a reference to anyone else who might have interpreted it in that way. It should be noted that this does not mean that Taylor is necessarily wrong in his judgement, merely that he has not supported it. Similarly, Taylor quotes Lloyd George’s words against him in the note about his treatment of Churchill without giving a source for the quotation. We need not doubt that the quotation is genuine, but it is often a good idea to follow these things up and historians ought to provide the reference details to allow other historians to do so.Lastly, Taylor quotes a popular song, ‘Lloyd George knew my father’. This particular ditty, which consisted of singing the two lines he gives over and over again to the tune of ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers!’ had a long life in popular usage – it was still sometimes heard in the 1970s – and here Taylor is quoting from common knowledge: he can safely assume his readers will know what he is talking about, though, since he is using it to make a point about the way Lloyd George’s government was viewed at the time, a note about the origins of the ditty might have been appropriate.<< Commentaries ::  George Dangerfield, The Strange Death of Liberal England© 2017 University of Cambridge

So many of the manuscript sources on which they based their writings have disappeared that we have to use them, in effect, as primary sources for the periods they wrote about, cross referencing where possible with other sources, literary or archaeological, or with what we know of other, analogous periods of history.This is problematic because Roman historians were not writing for generations many centuries later but for the readers of their own day. Like other writings at the time, Roman historical works were often read aloud to an audience, so that writers often wrote with an ear to how their words would sound to a listener.Suetonius The Twelve Caesars >>Gibbon The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He does not feel the need to tell us who Caractacus or  Agricola were – he assumes his readers are already familiar with them.The  British leaders, Caractacus and Boadicea (the usual, though mistaken,  rendering of the name of the queen of the Iceni tribe. Her name was  actually Boudicca or Boudica), are presented positively: the former  shows fortitude, the latter is driven to revolt by despair for which, he  implies, she was not to blame.However, the people of Britain,  while still possessing valour, are too undisciplined, too inconstant and  too divided to stand up to the “steady progress” of the disciplined  Roman legions. This, however, is not necessarily as bad as it might  appear. The Romans have well organised troops and good commanders, but  dissolute emperors; the Britons have good leaders and can learn the  discipline they lack from the Romans, especially from Agricola.Gibbon  does not say it overtly, but his readers would certainly infer from  this passage that this particular conquest, presented in almost entirely  positive terms, laid the foundations for British military and political  power in their own day.<< What Happens in this Passage? ::  Language >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

In the eighteenth century the  ancients were greatly admired for their philosophy and high ideals:  they were thought of as exponents of universal truths, as relevant to  the eighteenth century as to their own day. We see evidence of this  reverence for the ancient world in the eighteenth century taste for  neoclassical architecture and in the taste among the rich to have  themselves painted or sculpted in classical dress. The excavations of  Pompeii prompted a craze for classical antiquity and many young men set  off from Britain to undertake the 'Grand Tour', visiting the sites in  Greece and Italy in order to imbibe their spirit of knowledge and  wisdom. Most of these young men spent their time imbibing a quite  different sort of spirit but it was, by his own account, while sitting  in the ruins of the Roman Forum that the writer Edward Gibbon decided to  undertake the massive task of writing a full account of the decline and  fall of the great city and its empire.Unlike Suetonius,  therefore, Gibbon’s scope was much broader and his central character is  the Roman world itself, rather than any individual emperor. His work  dwarfs Suetonius’ short sketches: it covers the story from the height of  the empire’s strength and prosperity in the 2nd century AD, through the  fall of Rome in AD 476 through to the fall of Constantinople, capital  of the eastern Roman or 'Byzantine' Empire in 1453. Gibbon’s task was  not simply to recount the events that traced Rome’s decline but to  identify its root causes.<< The Roman World :: Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The eighteenth century British took great pride in the fact that Britain had been part of the Roman Empire: they saw themselves and the empire they were beginning to establish overseas as 'new Romans', their heirs to the Caesars. The Roman occupation of Britain was therefore generally presented in a positive light, as is the case here.  << Introduction :: What happens in this passage? >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The most striking example is his characterisation of  the Roman emperors Claudius, Nero and Domitian as stupid, dissolute and  timid; later he refers to the emperors as weak and vicious. Elsewhere  he talks in disapproving terms of the Romans' avarice, which he terms  "ignoble". This portrait of the Romans is rescued by the capable Roman  generals, especially the "virtuous Agricola".Gibbon often uses  the language of slavery to emphasise the fate of the Britons: they  submit to the "Roman yoke", they cannot avoid the "slavery of their  country" and they have to "wear their chains", though Agricola hopes  that conquering Ireland too will make things easier for the Britons.  This use of the imagery of slavery would have struck the eighteenth  century British very forcibly: they prided themselves on being a free  people, often contrasting themselves with the slaves and serfs they saw  in other countries, and popular patriotic songs like Thomas Arne's Rule, Britannia! written in 1740 or the verses of "God Save the King" stressed that Britons would never be slaves.<< Commentary ::  Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

He had certainly read  extremely widely in the authors from the ancient world: when his work  was attacked he produced a detailed defence outlining the impressive  breadth of his reading. Here he compares Caesar's and Suetonius’  different accounts of why the Romans decided to invade Britain and  decides that, in the matter of the pearl fisheries, Suetonius is  probably the better source.He fits in some further references  both to classical writers, such as Tacitus and Pomponius Mela, and to  writers of his own day, such as Camden and Horsley, even including a  light hearted reference to Irish writers feeling rather put out that  Agricola thought their island would require so few troops to conquer.The  note about Gibbon’s reference to the Grampian Hills, where he has drawn  a mistaken inference from Tacitus, is by Oliphant Smeaton, who produced  a copiously edited version of Gibbon’s work in the early years of the  twentieth century and demonstrates the sort of difficulty that is thrown  up when we have to rely on the writings of Roman historians.<< Language :: Suetonius The Twelve Caesars >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

This departed from, but did not dismantle, the precept laid down by Augustus not to extend the continental Roman Empire. The Britons showed great bravery in their resistance but they were no match for the Roman generals, who were often better men than the emperors who sent them.

So many of the manuscript sources on which they based their writings have disappeared that we have to use them, in effect, as primary sources for the periods they wrote about, cross referencing where possible with other sources, literary or archaeological, or with what we know of other, analogous periods of history.This is problematic because Roman historians were not writing for generations many centuries later but for the readers of their own day. Like other writings at the time, Roman historical works were often read aloud to an audience, so that writers often wrote with an ear to how their words would sound to a listener.Suetonius The Twelve Caesars >>Gibbon The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

We do not even learn exactly what happened to Sejanus. Although we are being given the impression of a contemptible old man launching a shabby plot against his own lieutenant (with the clear implication that he and Sejanus deserve each other) Suetonius also suggests that everything happens because Tiberius commands it: Tiberius detains the provincial governors in Rome, he had Agrippina and her sons transferred from prison to prison, he sends messages to the Senate and draws up contingency plans in case the plot backfires. The implication is that the political system is itself so rotten that even a creature such as Tiberius, in his dotage and physically remote from Rome (note that he does not even return from Capri after Sejanus has been successfully removed), commands absolute obedience. Suetonius’ listeners and readers were also living under emperors with absolute power: most of those under whom he lived were capable rulers, but the violent reign of the erratic Domitian (81-96 AD) was a reminder that the system could still give power to the unstable or the despotic.<< What Happens in this Passage? :: Language >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Under Sejanus’ administration the law, especially the law of treason, was increasingly used to silence the emperor’s critics. Sejanus himself grew ambitious, making many enemies, while Tiberius grew increasingly paranoid about threats to overthrow him. He suspected everyone, including Sejanus.Suetonius (c.69-c.140 AD) The Twelve Caesars translated by Robert Graves (London: Penguin, 1976) pp.141-263. Much evidence is extant, not only of the hatred that Tiberius earned but of the state of terror in which he himself lived, and the insults heaped upon him. He forbade anyone to consult soothsayers, except openly and with witnesses present; and even attempted to suppress all oracles in the neighbourhood of Rome – but desisted for fear of the miraculous power shown by the sacred Lots, which he brought to Rome in a sealed chest from the Temple of Fortune at Palestrina. They vanished and did not become visible again until returned to the same temple.Tiberius had assigned provinces to certain ex-consuls whom he distrusted; but, not daring to relax his surveillance, detained them in Rome for several years until their successors had been appointed. Meanwhile, they relayed his frequent instructions to their lieutenants and agents in the provinces which they officially governed, yet were unable to visit.64. After exiling Agrippina and her two sons he always moved them from one place of confinement to another in closed litters, with their wrists and ankles fettered and a military escort to prevent all persons met on the road from even stopping to watch the litter go by, let alone glance inside.65. Becoming aware that Sejanus’s birthday was being publicly celebrated, and that golden statues had been raised to him everywhere, as a preliminary step to his usurpation of the throne, Tiberius found some difficulty in getting rid of his tool and did so at last by subterfuge rather than by the exercise of imperial authority. First of all, to detach Sejanus from his own immediate entourage, while pretending to honour him, Tiberius appointed him his colleague in a fifth consulship, which he assumed solely for this purpose ten years after the fourth; but did not visit Rome for his inauguration. Next, he made Sejanus believe that he would soon marry him into the imperial family and be awarded tribunicial power; and then, taking him off his guard, sent a shamefully abject message to the Senate begging, among other things, to be fetched into their presence under military escort by one of the two subsidiary Consuls – he complained that he was a poor, lonely old man whom Sejanus was plotting to assassinate. But he had taken precautions against the revolt which he feared might yet break out, by ordering that his grandson Drusus, who was still alive, should be released if necessary from his prison at Rome and appointed commander-in-chief. He thought, indeed, of taking refuge at the headquarters of some provincial army and had a naval flotilla standing by to carry him off the island; where he waited on a cliff top for the distant bonfire signals (announcing all possible eventualities), which he had ordered to be sent in case his couriers might be delayed. Even when Sejanus’s conspiracy had been suffocated Tiberius did not show the least sign of increased confidence, but remained in the so-called Villa Io for the next nine months.<< Introduction :: What Happens in this Passage? >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

With that caveat, note the use of language to express  Suetonius' low opinion of Tiberius. There are repeated references to his  fear – "the state of terror in which he lived", "for fear of the  miraculous power", "not daring to relax his surveillance". Section 65  has references to Tiberius' use of subterfuge, which suggests his lack  of "imperial authority", especially when it leads him to send a  "shamefully abject" message to the Senate. Suetonius does not waste much  sympathy on Sejanus, however, describing his as Tiberius' "tool".<< Commentary ::  Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, writers in  the ancient world were often at pains to stress that they had undertaken  research and that their portrait of the past was supported by evidence.  Here, Suetonius stresses that "much evidence is extant" not only of how  much people hated Tiberius but of the terror it engendered in Tiberius.  We are not told in detail what this evidence is, but the examples that  follow in the text are presumably examples of it. References to letters  going out to Roman provinces and to proceedings in the Senate would  almost certainly have been based on the official records of Senatorial  business, almost none of which has survived.<< Language :: Gibbon The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Suetonius, who lived through a period of stable but despotic imperial rule, wanted to explore the nature of imperial power and how a city with a strong republican tradition had ended up handing absolute power to individuals and dynasties, some of whom abused it flagrantly. His eye for salacious detail has led some to dismiss Suetonius as a sort of Roman gossip-columnist; more recently, however, historians have recognised the value of his work as a reflection of 1st and 2nd century attitudes towards power.<< The Roman World ::  Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Fearful that Sejanus was plotting to overthrow him, Tiberius pretended to honour him but secretly schemed to have Sejanus arrested. He also drew up contingency plans in case the arrest sparked off a popular revolt against him. The arrest went smoothly, but Tiberius remained on the island of Capri.<< Extract :: Commentary >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Whigs tended to stress the importance of parliament, as a counterbalance to the Crown and of the Church of England; Tories were much more deeply attached to the power and authority of Crown and Church.The Whig view of history grew out of the unprecedented strength and prosperity of mid-nineteenth century Britain, which led the world in scientific and technological development and ruled an empire which stretched from Canada to South Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand and the Caribbean. It is little wonder that the Victorians saw themselves as the heirs to the Romans, but with one important difference: instead of an autocratic emperor, the British had a limited, parliamentary monarchy which, they believed, placed Britain on a higher moral plane; as a result the Victorians tended to revere institutions such as parliament, the Church of England, the legal system, the universities and the monarchy, as components of a perfectly balanced constitution, a model for other countries to follow. When the Victorians asked themselves how they had come to live in such an apparently perfect society, they looked for an explanation to the history of England.In the Whig view, English history was the story of a struggle for the recovery of political and religious liberty which, they held, had been lost at the time of the Norman Conquest. It should be noted, incidentally, that this version of Anglo-Saxon history was entirely fanciful but still strongly believed in. They saw heroic figures, like Hereward the Wake, who led a resistance movement against the Normans from the fens of East Anglia, or the medieval barons who forced King John to accept Magna Carta, trying to propel England forward towards that state of liberty the Victorians enjoyed; their opponents, by definition, were trying to pull England back. These 'villains' included despotic kings, like King John, and the Catholicism, which the Victorians regarded as superstitious and autocratic.Central to the Whig interpretation of history was the long conflict between Crown and Parliament that dominated the seventeenth century. While they regretted the bloodshed of the Civil War and the execution of King Charles I, the Whigs saw the defeat of the Crown and its subjugation to Parliament as essential to the establishment of a free society. However, in 1660 the Stuart monarchy returned. King Charles II, and especially his Catholic brother, James II, seemed to pose a formidable threat to the supremacy of parliament and appeared to be trying to establish Catholic autocratic rule in England. How, in the crucial year 1688, parliament was able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and lay the foundations for the prosperity of Victorian Britain was the story that the Whig writer and administrator Thomas Babington Macaulay set out to tell in his History of England.Macaulay was a firm believer in the superiority and moral integrity of Britain's institutions. As a member of the government of British India he had dismantled the previous education system by which British administrators learned about the history, languages and culture of India, in favour of an entirely western curriculum, declaring scornfully that there was more value in a shelf of western authors than in the whole literary culture of the east. He applied much the same bumptious self-confidence to his reading of English history, which he sought to relate in an engaging style that, he hoped, would make his book as popular a read as the latest novel. In that aim he certainly succeeded.Extract >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

The idea of progress through human endeavour was very popular in Britain at the time Macaulay was writing, so he was to some extent preaching to the converted. We can also imagine that most of his readers would have enjoyed the very flattering image he gives of the Britain of their own day, the beneficiary of the progress he traces from medieval times through the Tudors and Stuarts to modern times.Note that Macaulay sees England's happy position as the result 'partly of our geographical and partly of our moral position': the question of whether the British (in common with general usage at the time Macaulay, himself a Scot, used 'England' to mean 'Britain') were morally superior because they had not undergone Continental-style war and revolution or whether their superior morality was the reason they had avoided them was the historical chicken-and-egg question of the day. That the British were morally superior to other peoples Macaulay here takes as read.It might well be objected that Macaulay is here overlooking the civil wars that engulfed the British Isles in the 1640s and the very revolution against James II that is the main subject of his own book; however, Macaulay, in line with standard practice at the time, sees the events of the seventeenth century through very rose-tinted glasses.The Civil Wars, in reality as brutal and destructive as any subsequent civil war of our own day, was generally presented as a romantic contest fought by dashing characters in gorgeous costumes, while the overthrow of James II in 1688 was remembered as a bloodless event, conveniently overlooking the extremely bloody conflict it sparked off in Ireland. To modern eyes, therefore, this passage might seem breathtakingly self-satisfied; to Macaulay's readers, however, it would have seemed little more than a statement of the obvious.<< What happens in this passage :: Language >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Despite giving his work the title A History of England Macaulay in fact concentrated on the constitutional crises of the period from Charles II's death in 1685 to the establishment of the Protestant Hanoverian dynasty in the 1710s. Here Macaulay states clearly his belief that England's history has been the story of material and moral progress.If we would study with profit the history of our ancestors, we must constantly be on our guard against that delusion which the well known names of families, places and offices naturally produce, and must never forget that the country of which we read was a very different country from that in which we live. In every experimental science there is a tendency towards perfection. In every human being there is a wish to ameliorate his own condition. These two principles have often sufficed, even when counteracted by great public calamities and by bad institutions, to carry civilisation rapidly forward. No ordinary misfortune, no ordinary misgovernment, will do so much to make a nation wretched, as the constant progress of physical knowledge and the constant effort of every man to better himself will do to make a nation prosperous. It has often been found that profuse expenditure, heavy taxation, absurd commercial restrictions, corrupt tribunals, disastrous wars, seditions, persecutions, conflagrations, inundations, have not been able to destroy capital so fast as the exertions of private citizens have been able to create it. It can easily be proved that, in our own land, the national wealth has, during at least six centuries, been almost uninterruptedly increasing; that it was greater under the Tudors than under the Plantagenets; that it was greater under the Stuarts than under the Tudors; that, in spite of battles, sieges, and confiscations, it was greater on the day of the Restoration than on the day when the long Parliament met; that, in spite of maladministration, of extravagance, of public bankruptcy, of two costly and unsuccessful wars, of the pestilence and of the fire, it was greater on the day of the death of Charles the Second than on the day of his Restoration. This progress, having continued during many ages, became at length, about the middle of the eighteenth century, portentously rapid, and has proceeded, during the nineteenth, with accelerated velocity. In consequence partly of our geographical and partly of our moral position, we have, during several generations, been exempt from evils which have elsewhere impeded the efforts and destroyed the fruits of industry. While every part of the Continent, from Moscow to Lisbon, has been the theatre of bloody and devastating wars, no hostile standard has been seen here but as a trophy. While revolutions have taken place all around us, our government has never once been subverted by violence. During more than a hundred years there has been in our island no tumult of sufficient importance to be called an insurrection; nor has the law been once borne down either by public fury or by regal tyranny: public credit has been held credit: the administration of justice has been pure: even in times which might by Englishmen be justly called evil times, we have enjoyed what almost every other nation in the world would have considered as an ample measure of civil and religious freedom. Every man has felt entire confidence that the state would protect him in the possession of what had been earned by his diligence and hoarded by his selfdenial. Under the benignant influence of peace and liberty, science has flourished, and has been applied to practical purposes on a scale never before known. The consequence is that a change to which the history of the old world furnishes no parallel has taken place in our country.Thomas Babington Macaulay History of England (London: Heron Books, 1967; first published 1848) pp.219-221<< Introduction :: What happens in this passage? >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

Macaulay is here adopting something of the style of a teacher: the passage opens 'If we would study with profit the history of our ancestors', rather as if he were delivering a lecture. He also makes much use of abstract nouns and concepts – 'a tendency towards perfection', 'ordinary misfortune', 'of maladministration, of extravagance, of public bankruptcy'; there are very few references to actual events. This gives the impression that Macaulay can survey the whole breadth of English history, indeed of human experience, rather than getting tied down to one particular period or example. This style lends him an air of academic authority for his really very dubious and sweeping statements.<< Commentary :: Sources >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is mainly because he was writing for a popular audience who would soon be bored if they had to go over his sources; there is a marked contrast here with Edward Gibbon, who was writing for a more scholarly readership. Macaulay's purpose is not to prove his claims but to reassure his readers that they can be proved, and easily too.Moreover, even a superficial knowledge of history will show that, while European countries had been staging revolutions with bewildering frequency at the time Macaulay was writing, no such thing had happened in Britain since the seventeenth century. When Macaulay claims, therefore, that 'our government has never once been subverted by violence' he does not offer evidence because he sees no need to: his readers know this and our own knowledge, when it is confirmed by what we read, is always the most convincing evidence. Macaulay did research his work, but his reading was largely confined to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century political pamphlets, which were produced in their thousands in the days before regular newspapers. It was a relatively narrow basis of evidence for the wide-ranging claims Macaulay intended to make.<< Language © 2017 University of Cambridge

However, 'secondary source' is not an entirely satisfactory term. It suggests a hierarchy of importance, with 'secondary' writings ranking less highly than 'primary' sources. This can lead the unwary student into assuming that primary sources must somehow be a more direct - and therefore more accurate - reflection of the past. In fact, primary source material may tell us relatively little until a historian has been able to explain what it is, how it fits into its wider context, and how its contents can shed light on that context.That being said, we should subject secondary sources to the same scrutiny as we do primary material. Historical writing is as much a reflection of its author's personality and outlook, and of the circumstances in which she or he lived, as any other form of writing. To paraphrase the British historian Eric Hobsbawm, historians do not leave their own personalities at the door of their studies, the way one would shed a wet raincoat. Indeed, historical writing can also provide 'primary' evidence of the time when it was written - just think, for example, of the writings of Edward Gibbon or AJP Taylor, historians whose works can provide rich evidence of the concerns of their own periods. It is also true that different audiences can interpret historical writing in very different ways. The highly subjective nature of history writing - selecting the material, constructing the argument and choosing the language in which to communicate it - and the equally subjective process of reading history have led postmodernist scholars to declare the writing of history to be a largely pointless task, which can make little claim to objectivity or to giving an 'accurate' or 'truthful' picture of the past. Historians have responded robustly to this attack on their profession: after all, the logic of the postmodernist case would undermine any form of ‘factual’ writing (certainly, as historians of science have pointed out, much the same accusations of subjectivity can be made against scientists). Indeed, it would be very difficult to think what an entirely objective historical account might look like, for even the most apparently neutral and factual account, such as one might see in an encyclopedia, carries its own interpretation which others might contest - as the original designers of Wikipedia, to name but one example, clearly understood...Hidden Meanings of Historical Writing >>© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is therefore crucial to show your interest by exploring history further in your own time. The best way to do this is undoubtedly through reading – reading widely, with discernment, and outside of your comfort zone. Moreover, reading is fundamental to all historical study, research and writing, and getting into the habit now will help your development as a historian.It's probably no surprise, then, that quite a lot of Cambridge applicants have asked over the years for guidance on additional reading. Good historians are analytical and make their own sound decisions. So while we do offer a few suggestions for additional reading here, you should not treat these as some kind of prescriptive syllabus, but merely as guides to further exploration. It is only by reading more that you learn what kinds of history you like, which works you admire and find thought-provoking and stimulating, and how to assess the merits of a particular work.  This question often elicits the response: 'It is important that you enjoy the history you are reading about.' We certainly hope you enjoy lots of the history that you read, but none of us enjoys everything, because we're not all interested in the same things and don't all respond in the same ways to works whose contents and approaches can differ greatly.The key thing, in fact, is that you learn from what you read and to do this you need to read analytically. This means making mental notes and asking questions all the way through your reading. You might try asking yourself the following questions when you finish a book or an article, and writing down your answers:© 2017 University of Cambridge

Scholars from outside Cambridge as well as local speakers are invited to give papers on their current work. A major function of most seminars is to allow graduate students to present their work, especially at a late stage of their PhD study. In addition, seminars help to acquaint students with the latest developments in the subject and to teach them the skills of advanced academic debate.The seminars are also the meeting place for all graduate students working in a particular area in Cambridge and offer significant help in integrating PhD students into the wider academic and graduate student community. Students are expected to attend the relevant seminars; it is important to review with your Supervisor the range of seminars available. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open. For full information for applicants please see the Research funding webpage.  Film show: To Sir with Love (1967)

It aims to bring academics, researchers and students from a wide variety of fields, academic backgrounds, and geographical locations into ever-closer dialogue with one another, and to explore the many ways in which cross-disciplinary themes, ideas, arguments and evidence can illuminate the early modern period.The seminar also seeks to challenge conventional boundaries of periodization and space, inviting scholars of ancient, medieval and modern worlds to explore the relationships between their work and the early modern period.The meeting is divided into two sections. The first section invites a guest speaker to deliver a paper on their research for one hour. The second section provides 15-30 minutes for the speaker to answer questions on the topic and engage in a discussion on the cross-disciplinary implications of their work. Attendees are invited to bring a packed lunch to the seminar. Tea and coffee is also provided.The seminars are held in Room sr14 in the Faculty of English from 12.00 to 13:15pm unless otherwise indicated For further information and conversation there is a seminar blog11th Oct Sara Norja, Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of English, University of Turku.

Scholars from outside Cambridge as well as local speakers are invited to give papers on their current work. A major function of most seminars is to allow graduate students to present their work, especially at a late stage of their PhD study. In addition, seminars help to acquaint students with the latest developments in the subject and to teach them the skills of advanced academic debate.The seminars are also the meeting place for all graduate students working in a particular area in Cambridge and offer significant help in integrating PhD students into the wider academic and graduate student community. Students are expected to attend the relevant seminars; it is important to review with your Supervisor the range of seminars available. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

In your first and second years (Part I) you have the chance to choose from seven periods of European history from 776BC to the present and five periods of British history since 380AD. You study British history in particular depth, taking separate papers in Political and in Economic & Social history. The Faculty also offers introductory courses in world history, American history and the history of Political Thought at Part I – in each case there are two separate papers allowing students to begin to specialise in these fields before their final year. All these courses are taught through a mix of Faculty lectures and weekly supervisions organised by your college, and are assessed by written examination at the end of your second year. But you will also study one of approximately a dozen ‘Themes and Sources’ courses at Part I. These courses are based around a body of set texts (usually both primary and secondary). They are taught through Faculty classes and assessed through a coursework essay rather than an examination.Because it is one of the largest and most renowned history departments in the world, the Faculty is able to combine breadth of coverage with a rich choice of research-led courses at Part II. Here courses take two forms: ‘Special Subjects’, intensively taught and organised around a tightly-defined body of primary sources, and ‘Specified Subjects’, also often source-led, but more thematic in focus and assessed solely by examination (you will do an extended coursework essay as part of the Special Subject as well as an examination which tests your knowledge of set primary sources). You normally have a choice of up to twenty Specified Subjects (including the Political Thought papers) and between ten and fifteen Special Subjects. Approximately half of all students choose to write a dissertation in place of one of their two Specified papers, and few encounter difficulty securing a qualified supervisor.Finally, the Faculty also teaches historical practice itself through its extensive programme of lectures and classes on Historical Argument and Practice. This is assessed as part of the ‘preliminary’ examinations taken immediately after Easter in your first year, and again at Part II (where it represents one-fifth of the degree). ‘HAP’, as it is usually known, gives you the chance to develop historiographical interests in themes such as gender, religion or warfare that range widely across time and place. The links from this page explain the Tripos in greater detail. They allow you to see which options are running in particular years, how they will be taught and assessed. You will also find links to useful advice on study skills, as well as to past papers and lecturers’ feedback on teaching and assessment.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It is intended to provide you with informal guidance about your progress to date. To appear on the list of successful candidates, students must pass an examination in three papers: the first two of the Part I outline papers that they have studied, together with Historical Argument and Practice (HAP).Prelim to Part I papers 2–18 correspond exactly with Papers 2-18 in Part I of the Tripos.Prelim to Part I Paper 19 is specifically designed to examine any first year students who choose to study one of the World History papers (Part I Papers 21 or 23).Part I papers 19 and 20 (Political Thought) and 22 and 24 (American history) are not available in the Prelim to Part I examination. Prelim examination timetable 2018 - available in Feburary 2018The Part I and Part II examinations are in late May and early June. Each examination paper has equal weighting in the assessment.The Part I examination consists of five 3-hour examinations (one for each of your outline papers) and one long essay, for Themes and Sources, which is submitted in the January of your second year.The Part II examination comprises three or four 3-hour examinations (depending on whether you offer a dissertation) and one long essay. For each Part II Specified Subject, you take one paper and answer three questions. Part II Special Subjects are examined by means of a Long Essay and a three-hour examination on 'gobbets' taken from the set sources. For the Historical Argument and Practice examination, you sit one paper and answer only one question.Optional Part II Dissertations are submitted at the beginning of the Easter Term. The compulsory Part II Special Subject Long Essay is submitted at the beginning of the Easter Term. Students taking Part II over two years (either as Affiliated Students or having transferred from another Tripos) are required to sit a Prelim to Part II examination at the end of their first year. This examination comprises Paper 1 (HAP) and two papers chosen from Sections C-D. These three papers are not classed and do not count towards Part II. The following year, these papers are re-examined, together with a Special Subject (Papers 2 & 3) and either two more papers from Sections C-D, or a dissertation and one more. The Part II classification is determined entirely by the results achieved in these examinations. Part I  Part II   Prelim to Part II      The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

        The Raven web authentication system is provided and managed by University Information Services.© 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of HistoryStudying at CambridgeEnglish is a very rich and complex language and what follows can only draw attention to some of the most common problems and traps. The most effective way of improving your use of language beyond the basics is to read widely and absorb what works.Note too that some ‘rules’ are matters of taste.Sentences can be broken up by four symbols: the full stop, the colon, the semicolon, the comma (in descending order of emphasis).The full stop of course ends a sentence, which can be as little as a verb and its subject: ‘William marched north. The rebels retreated.’ But apart from an occasional use this is too staccato for academic discourse, as is persistent use of simple sentences of subject, verb, object. They work better in bodice-rippers: ‘He threw her over his saddle. She stared into his eyes. They galloped into the sunset.’ In academic writing sentences can be as long as you like (within reason) but the longer they are the more carefully you must steer the reader through them with effective punctuation - and make sure you don’t get lost half way. If in doubt, shorter is better.The colon [:] usually introduces material illustrating a point made in the opening part of a sentence, which often (but not always) takes the form of a list. See the three colons used above for examples.The semicolon [;] is generally used to link what could grammatically have been two separate sentences, often to imply a causal connection between them: ‘Alice snatched away the dog’s bone; the dog bit her.’ It is also used (particularly in lists) when using a comma would be unclear – see below for an example.The comma [,] is the lightest form of punctuation. Its simplest use is dividing items in a list: ‘The three cardinal virtues are faith, hope and charity’ – in such cases note that putting a comma before the ‘and’ (or not) is a matter of taste. Where the items in the list are more complex than this (and especially where the list has been introduced by a colon) it might be clearer to use a semicolon between them instead. For example:Collingbourne’s verse targeted three of Richard III’s leading allies: the Cat, William Catesby; the Rat, Richard Ratcliff; and Lovell our Dog, Francis viscount Lovell.Commas are also used to mark off a parenthesis [an aside] in a less obtrusive way than using brackets or dashes (for which see below): ‘The king’s uncle the duke of York, who had not hitherto been politically very active, was now made Regent.’ If you ‘open’ a parenthesis with a comma, don’t forget to close it. Apart from these two roles the use of commas tends to be fairly subjective, but remember that too many can be as confusing as too few. If in doubt, saying the sentence aloud should show you where the breaks come.Brackets and Dashes. These are ‘stronger’ ways of digressing temporarily from the main thrust of the sentence and mark off the aside more decisively. If, in the example used above, you wanted to identify York you could say ‘The king’s uncle the duke of York (d.1402), who had not…’. Note that a comma must never precede brackets although, as here, it can follow them. Dashes are mid way between brackets and commas in emphasis and are generally regarded as rather informal: ‘Thomas Cromwell – whom Elton idolised – may not have been quite so impressive.’Apostrophes [’] have two functions. One is possessive: Frederick’s army. Where, as here, the owner is singular the apostrophe precedes the s, where plural it follows it: the rebels’ army. If in doubt try thinking of it the long way round: the flag of the nation = the nation’s flag; the flag of the nations = the nations’ flag. Where a singular noun ends in s, such as St James, the possessive is strictly St James’s – or you could say instead the shrine of St James (or whatever) to avoid the double s.Apostrophes also signal that something is missing: that’s (= that is), couldn’t (= could not) etc. But this sort of colloquialism should not be used in formal academic discourse. These two usages clash in the case of it. It’s is not possessive but = it is (and, as a colloquialism, is out of place in academic writing). The possessive version is its: ‘The lion dragged its prey away.’ Thus: ‘It’s amazing how quickly that cat gobbles its dinner.’Inverted commas are placed around direct speech and direct quotations. It is now usual to use single commas - ‘Damn’ said the duchess – and only use double commas [“…”] for a quotation within a quotation. If you want to quote at more length, however, indent the quotation without any inverted commas around it, as in the Collingbourne example above.Inverted commas can also be used to draw attention to a particular word, especially if its meaning is seen as weighted or problematic. A disbeliever in Elton’s view of Tudor government, for instance, might choose to talk of a Tudor ‘revolution’ in government. This is not something to be overdone but it is, in moderation, a useful way of registering a reservation. Note how ‘stronger’ was enclosed in inverted commas above, for instance, to signal that to talk of punctuation as strong and weak is resorting to metaphor.Tenses. 99% of your essay should be in the past tense: ‘John sealed Magna Carta’. Shifting into the present for dramatic emphasis (‘Brought to bay, John seals Magna Carta’) is almost invariably naff. That said, it is acceptable to say ‘Magna Carta demonstrates the importance of financial issues to John’s opponents’ because that is a present-day judgement. Note that the implication would be slightly different if you said ‘Magna Carta demonstrated the importance of financial issues to John’s opponents’.There are three past tenses: imperfect, perfect, pluperfect. The perfect is the usual one, describing a completed action: ‘William marched north’. The imperfect describes an ongoing action: ‘While William was marching north there was a rebellion’. The pluperfect describes an action before another one: ‘William had marched north before the rebellion broke out’.Agreement. Make sure that when the subject of the verb [the person(s) performing the action] is singular / plural, the verb is too. This is not usually a problem with the perfect and pluperfect tenses: he (had) marched / they (had) marched. It is in theory an issue with the imperfect, although no one is likely to muddle ‘he was marching’ with ‘they were marching’. Similarly in the present tense the difference between ‘Professor Postan argues that’ and ‘Marxist historians argue that’ is straightforward. But it can be trickier. ‘None’ is singular [= no one] so ‘none of the soldiers was killed’. Singular nouns for groups of people should also have a singular verb: ‘the council was in agreement’, ‘the army was marching’. But ‘people’ is usually treated as a plural: ‘the people were up in arms’.Infinitives. The split infinitive (‘to boldly go’) should be avoided (‘to go boldly’ is preferable). But just occasionally a split infinitive is clearer than the alternative and acceptable. Moral: rules are there to be broken (intelligently, not ignorantly).Shall / will. This can be a nightmare (Fowler, in The King’s English, spends twenty pages trying to unpick them). But the basics are easy. If you are simply using them of something that is going to happen in the future then ‘shall’ is used only in the first person (with I/we) but will for the second and third persons (with you/he/she/it/they). It is therefore incorrect to say ‘my essay shall discuss’ but ‘I shall discuss in my essay’ is correct. What muddies the water is that ‘shall’ can be used with the second and third person to imply an order (You shall go to the ball) and ‘will’ with the first person to imply a strong personal wish (I will go the ball).May / might. A similar nasty, but in practice the differences between them have all but vanished in modern usage. Two are still worth remembering. Used conditionally the main difference is one of tense: if something happened in the past then something else might have happened (also in the past); if something is happening now then something else may happen (in the future). Note also the difference between ‘If he had observed Magna Carta, John might have avoided civil war’ (a straightforward conditional in the past tense) and ‘John may have agreed Magna Carta but he could not avoid civil war’ (= even though he did x, y still happened).These are words that bridge two sentences or two clauses within a single sentence. Most can be used in both contexts, the exception is ‘and’, which should not (at least in formal English) begin a new sentence. Conjunctions can operate in various ways.Most straightforwardly they create a list: and / also / in addition / moreover / similarly. Beware of piling up too many of these; lists are boring. You need to identify the most important items and deal with them in order of priority.They can create a chronological relationship: when / before / after / during. But avoid falling into a sustained narrative.They can also register a reservation. This is most simply done by making a statement and then qualifying it, with the modification introduced by words such as but / however / on the other hand: ‘The English won the battle but lost the war’. The structure can be reversed: ‘Although the English won the battle, they lost the war’.But note that however can = no matter how: ‘However fast he ran, Jane was quicker’. In this case it is not followed by a comma. Compare: ‘However, fast as he ran, Jane was quicker’.Personal pronouns are I/we/you/he/she/it. These are usually problem free but beware ambiguity. ‘Edward IV pardoned his brother in 1471, he was later drowned in a butt of malmsey.’ It is the brother who was drowned, not Edward. ‘In 1471 Edward pardoned his brother, who was later drowned…’ would nail the ambiguity.Their official definition is ‘a word or group of words used before a noun or pronoun to relate it to some other constituent of a sentence’ – which doesn’t help very much. In practice they are all those tricksy little words like to / at / in / of.Most of them – against, between, among, across, beyond etc – are problem free. But note the difference in meaning (now rapidly vanishing under the influence of US English) between the prepositions inside / outside and the nouns inside [of ] / outside [of]:More problematic are cases where a particular word ‘takes’ [= is followed by] a particular preposition or prepositions. ‘King John agreed to Magna Carta’ does not mean the same thing as ‘King John agreed with Magna Carta’. ‘I found a fault in the book’ is not the same as ‘I found fault with the book’. In other cases there is only one option and it has to be right: ‘aggrieved by’, ‘oblivious of’, ‘estranged from’ and hundreds more. The only solution is to buy a good dictionary and USE it.SpellingThe same goes for spelling. A spell-check will get you only so far since it cannot pick up words that exist but are wrong (either because mistyped or misused). If in doubt, look it up. English is not a logical language when it comes to spelling - a few common snares follow. Note: many are not the same in US English and might baffle your computer’s spell check.affect/effect. To affect is to have an (emotional) effect on; to effect is to bring about.-ant / -ent endings. The difference usually reflects their Latin root, but this does not allow for words that are –ant as nouns but –ent as adjectives e.g. correspondant/ent, dependant/ent, descendant/ent, pendant/ent.-ecy / -esy endings. When –ecy is a noun, -esy a verb e.g. prophecy / prophesy.-ence / ense endings. When –ence is a noun and –ense a verb e.g. licence / license.-ice / ise endings. When –ice is a noun and –ise a verb e.g. advice/advise, device/devise, practice / practise-ise / -ize endings for verbs. There is a genuine difference of opinion here for many verbs, but some are definitely –ise (e.g. advertise, compromise, despise, devise, surprise) and it could be argued that the simplest thing to do is standardise them all as –ise.principal / principle. Principal (noun) is a leader, (adjective) primary/leading; principle (noun) a moral imperative. For example: ‘The Principal of Newnham was a woman of strong principles.’(Rosemary Horrox, January 2010)The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It encourages students to raise and discuss fundamental questions that relate their specialist knowledge to more general themes of historical inquiry and explanation.The focus of HAP is on understanding the conceptual, historiographical and methodological dimensions of historical argument and practice. It is a summative paper, that requires candidates to forge connections between different aspects of their historical knowledge, for example by critically evaluating the merits of different approaches in relation to the more specific and empirical material that they have encountered elsewhere in their study of the past.HAP is a compulsory element of Part II History and typically counts for 20% of the final degree. It is also a necessary requirement of those students who appear on the successful list of candidates for the Prelim to Part I.There is no fundamental difference between the paper set for the Prelim and that set for Part II, although examiners will inevitably expect a higher level of knowledge and sophistication from candidates sitting the latter. At both levels, the paper is assessed by means of a three-hour examination, in which candidates are required to answer only one question. The exam paper, which normally consists of around 30 questions, is designed to encourage broad discussion of issues derived from, and relevant to the full range of papers offered by the Faculty.  Candidates are also encouraged to draw upon their wider reading.The best way of viewing the Prelim paper is as a dry-run for Part II: an early opportunity to experiment with making the sorts of broader connections and comparisons that are not always possible in the context of the other more specialized Part I papers.Students should begin to consider issues relating to HAP from their first year of study and continue to develop their ideas as they move through their various Part I and Part II papers. Although there is no formal exam of HAP in Part I, second-years are encouraged to keep thinking about HAP and to make a point of attending at least 8 lectures during the course of the year.Past papers are available here [Cambridge only].In deciding which lectures to attend in which year, all students are advised to consult with their Directors of Studies. The programme of lectures, which is open to History undergraduates in all years, comprises two sets of hour-long lectures given by members of the Faculty’s teaching staff:In addition, a series of classes, led by graduate students and open to Part II undergraduates (only), will cover the same themes explored in the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lectures (see further information for Part II students). Graduate led classes will cover the same themes explored in the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lectures. The purpose of the classes is to give Part II students the opportunity to follow up the ideas aired in the lectures, to supplement the lecture with some reading, and to participate actively in discussion. The classes will last about 90 minutes and will be capped at 20 undergraduates (parallel sessions will be run for popular topics). The classes will proceed during Lent in a sequence that follows the themes in the ‘Concepts and Problems’ lecture series. Classes are not mandatory, but students are strongly encouraged to attend classes for up to three Concepts and Problems lectures. Information will be circulated during Michaelmas, and registration for these classes will open in the latter part of Michaelmas term. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The University’s guidelines state that Plagiarism is defined as submitting as one's own work, irrespective of intent to deceive, that which derives in part or in its entirety from the work of others without due acknowledgement. Note that when detected, plagiarism incurs serious penalties, which may extend to a failure to obtain a degree.  In line with University policy (above), the History Faculty also penalizes work which, without constituting plagiarism, still shows poor scholarly practices in failing to acknowledge with adequate clarity the contributions of others.  Such practices include acknowledging the work of historians only partially or citing primary source material you have not actually consulted; there is a full discussion of such practices below.  To avoid such penalties, candidates must leave examiners in no doubt as to which parts of any submission are original, which derivative.Plagiarism can utilise many sources and media (books, journals, newspapers, websites, unpublished material, illustrations, data, and the work of other students).  It can be distinguished in the following ways:Self-evidently, historical research and writing are, in varying ways, collaborative.  All historians use original sources, habitually refer to the work of other historians, converse and debate, and hence, in order to demarcate what is original from what is derivative, conventions have developed.  These include:Plagiarism and poor scholarly practice frequently arise from inadvertence.  In the course of your undergraduate career, you will make many notes on lectures, on various printed texts, even on conversations in supervisions and classes.  In such notes, it is important to distinguish between the ideas and language of others, and your own thoughts and language, or else it can be easy – after the lapse of months or even years – to forget who said what, and to imagine that what is borrowed from others is your own.Traditionally, supervision essays were unannotated, as, by necessity, are all scripts in three-hour unseen examinations, but word-processing makes it easier for you to acquire the scholarly habits of furnishing footnotes and bibliographies in weekly essays.   In all circumstances it is imperative to place inverted commas around quotations and to attribute ideas to their original authors in your written text.The Faculty style guide, which explains how to do footnotes and bibliographies in essays and dissertations, can be found here.The following examples, drawn from Dr. Horrox’s handout, will help to show how these conventions work in practice.A passage in Rosemary Horrox, “Service”, in Horrox, ed., Fifteenth-Century Attitudes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 61, reads:Service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.  This essay is mainly concerned with the social and political manifestations of service, but it is important to recognize that these rested upon attitudes which were very deeply rooted in medieval society.  That society, to a degree which modern readers sometimes find disconcerting, was based on hierarchy.  Human society, mirroring the whole created universe, was arranged in order of importance.  There is no doubt that this orderliness was found satisfying in itself.  Medieval writing bears witness to a passion for arranging things in order and for resolving all the possible ambiguities and contradictions which might arise.  The minutely detailed lists of precedence to be found in late medieval courtesy books reflect not only a sense that it was socially important to seat people in the right order at the dinner table, but a sheer pleasure in working out the minutiae of relative statusIf, in the following manner, you used this passage without attribution and quotation marks, even if the wording is slightly varied, you would be a plagiarist:Service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.  It rested upon attitudes which were very deeply rooted in medieval society.  Society was based on hierarchy and arranged in order of importance.  The lists of precedence to be found in late medieval courtesy books reflect not only a sense that it was socially important to seat people in the right order at the dinner table, but pleasure in working out relative status.Acknowledging the source in the narrative, but implying that your narrative is independent of the source and, by omitting annotation, making it difficult for your larceny to be detected, is no less plagiarism.  The following example constitutes an abuse because it implies that only the idea expressed in the first sentence is owed to Dr Horrox’s article and that what follows is the candidate’s own train of thought:Horrox has made the point that service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.  We can see that it rested upon attitudes which were very deeply rooted in medieval society.  Society was based on hierarchy and arranged in order of importance.  The lists of precedence to be found in late medieval courtesy books reflect not only a sense that it was socially important to seat people in the right order at the dinner table, but pleasure in working out relative status.This is an especially noteworthy example because it illustrates a common failing in undergraduate work, a failure which is often the result of careless rather than intentionally evasive writing. By contrast, compare the following paragraph which avoids plagiarism because it quotes Horrox directly and provides annotation: As Horrox has said, “Service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages.”  This is because “society, to a degree which modern readers sometimes find disconcerting, was based on hierarchy.  Human society, mirroring the whole created universe, was arranged in order of importance”.  She further suggests that “this orderliness was found satisfying in itself” and uses the example of late medieval courtesy books to demonstrate this “sheer pleasure in working out the minutiae of relative status”.2This is far from model academic prose, however. By carefully dismembering Dr Horrox’s sentences and attributing each component to her our hypothetical author is safe from the charge of plagiarism. But this formulation still implies a selectivity which is in fact illusory because nothing of any substance has been omitted from the original. It would be better, because more succinct and considered, to write:Horrox has argued that “service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages”.  She links this to the contemporary emphasis on hierarchy, as reflected in the courtesy books.3Still better, because it shows understanding of the source and takes a critical position, would be:Horrox has argued that “service has some claim to be considered the dominant ethic of the middle ages”, but the discussion which follows is concerned only with male manifestations of service. 4 If we consider the role of women . . .Another unacceptable and fairly common habit is derivative citation without clear acknowledgement. This is poor scholarly practice for two reasons. First, it implies that you have read material which you have not. Secondly, it tends to downplay the role of the modern historian whose work contains the references. You commit this error if your footnote reads:Stains, Lucubrations on the State of the Nation, Boston 1860 instead of giving the extra information required:       Obadiah Stains, Lucubrations on the State of the Nation, Boston 1860, as cited by Nemo Niemand in his article mentioned above, note 7.The same standard of transparency applies to modern secondary literature: if you haven’t read it but are citing it at one remove via another piece of academic work, you MUST cite it as known to you BY THAT ROUTE, as in the following example:       E. Cortese, La norma giuridica, vol. 1, pp. 166-8, as cited by Nemo Niemand in his article ‘Law            and Politics’, p. 7[1] This document draws upon the University-wide statement on plagiarism, and Dr Rosemary Horrox’s handout, given to first-year undergraduates in a Study Skills session, provided by the Faculty of History.[2] Rosemary Horrox, “Service”, in Horrox, ed., Fifteenth-Century Attitudes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 61.[3] Ibid.[4] Ibid. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The teaching that you will receive over the next three years is designed to develop these skills.They will be examined in a number of ways: by outline papers and by the Themes and Sources paper in Part I, and by Special and Specified Subjects and a general paper in Historical Argument and Practice in Part II. You will also have the opportunity to substitute a dissertation on a subject of your choice for one of your Part II Specified Subject papers.The function of the History Faculty is to develop the course structure, to organise and oversee its working, to set and mark the Tripos examinations - and to offer lectures, which play a crucial role in defining the content of each paper. In addition, Themes and Sources options and Special Subjects are taught by Faculty classes.The role of colleges, in particular your college Director of Studies, is to arrange the teaching of all other papers and to help you get the most out of it. Your Director of Studies is responsible for overseeing your academic progress, and is the person to whom you should turn if you are having difficulties with work or with understanding what is expected of you. Never be afraid to approach him or her with your problems. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

web browser if you wish but then our site may not work correctly.Faculty of HistoryStudying at CambridgeYour supervisor is responsible for directing your work for each paper so that, if you work steadily, you will be equipped to tackle the examination paper. She or he sets you reading and an essay title each week, and is usually a specialist in the field of your paper. Do not be afraid to suggest possible topics yourself, if you have any particular interests (though you should be aware that there may be good reasons against studying them).You will normally have seven or eight supervisions per term, either individually or in very small groups. They last for one hour. You must write an essay for each one, and should submit it in advance so that the supervisor can make written comments on it. Essay titles are often taken from past exam papers, which you can find on the website.A supervision is intended to clarify, focus and extend the work which you have done. It is a conversation, based on what you have written, in which you will be asked to articulate your ideas. Do not be deferential, but relaxed; this is not an inquisition. The supervisor will discuss and assess the merit of your essay. He or she will relate it to other aspects of the topic, and will expect you to do so too, so you will need to read as widely as possible. At the end of the hour you should have a broader understanding of the topic. But you should not expect everything to be “slotted into place”. A good supervisor often stresses the limits to the historian‘s knowledge, the variety of valid historiographical approaches to the topics, and the problems involved in reaching a clear-cut understanding of it. Expect some of your assumptions to be challenged, even undermined.The supervision should be tailored to your needs so, to this end, it helps if you take the initiative and have your own agenda. Ask questions about anything in the reading which you have not understood. A supervision is not a lecture. But do not feel embarrassed to take brief notes on what the supervisor says - you may not remember it otherwise. It is very important to collect your thoughts immediately after the supervision ends and commit them to paper.Your supervisor should also advise you on attending lectures, which will supplement your understanding and define the scope of the paper further. Always ask about this, if the supervisor does not. And remember to refer to lecture notes when preparing your essays; they will often be extremely useful.Your supervision will normally take place at a regular and agreed time each week, and you must attend. Many colleges now charge undergraduates for supervisions missed without good cause.The purpose of your weekly essay is to accustom you to distilling your reading into a clear, concise yet rounded argument in answer to a specific and pointed question. You will be assessed on the plausibility and coherence of what you write, and on the breadth of understanding which you display. The art of essay-writing is not learned easily or quickly. It requires a good deal of regular practice. Do not despair if it takes time to improve; you have nearly two years before Part I.The essay title will be a question, or a statement for comment, and you should argue a case in response. Scrutinise the question carefully, check its meaning with your supervisor if in doubt, and take note of phrasing and slant. Key words usually need careful and early definition, to give focus.In terms of scope, it is appropriate to be wide-ranging, but not diffuse. If you decide to concentrate on one dimension or approach, try to indicate briefly why you have rejected other possible ones. Often you will find the books you read disagreeing with each other. If so, it will improve your essay if you practise evaluating the significance of these disagreements for the question you are addressing. Be sure to make your own views apparent throughout - not just in the conclusion. List books you have read at the end of your essay.Always take time to gather your thoughts before writing. Make a full and careful plan, organised by paragraph. Each paragraph should address the question directly and forward the development of your answer. It can help to experiment with ordering the component parts of an essay until you see how to present the argument fluently and persuasively. If you are having difficulty in planning your essays, show your plan as well as your essay to your supervisor.When writing, do not waffle. Each paragraph should elaborate a central point and support it with well-chosen evidence. Do not weigh your essay down with facts for their own sake; an essay is not a summary of a week’s reading, and you should treat it as an argument first and foremost, rather than an opportunity to display all that you know. Make sure to discuss the evidence in enough detail to give your argument weight. Including well-described case studies, but only those which support your argument, is an important part of the art of essay writing. Remember that being concise is also an art, and one you would do well to master to stand you in good stead for Tripos examinations.Some of your supervisors may specify a particular essay format. If they do not, try to aim at producing an essay of between 1,800 and 2,500 words. Most students prefer to write on a computer and, often, supervisors will be happy to receive the essay as an email attachment. If you do this, be sure that you do not lose the art of writing consecutive prose sentences fluently and quickly, because this is how you will be tested in Tripos. Some supervisors or Directors of Studies encourage their students to write at least some of their essays by hand. Even if you do not do this, please take steps to ensure that you do not lose the ability to write by hand, as most students will be required to do this in examinations. And if you cannot read your supervisor’s comments on your work - or understand them - don’t be afraid to ask for an explanation.Always re-read your essay before submitting it, to see if you have argued your case as clearly as you can. History is a literary art. Do not be surprised if supervisors devote a lot of time to the structure and style of your essays. Be prepared for corrections to syntax and spelling.You are encouraged to discuss essay-writing technique with your supervisor or Director of Studies.Useful paperback books on academic writing include:Your essay will be based on reading and digesting a number of books and articles. Usually your supervisor will give you a list, and will go through it giving further details about individual items. If he or she does not advise you on the most useful introductory literature, ask where you should start the week’s reading. By all means read beyond the suggested items. Consolidated reading lists for the Part I papers are available on the website.You will normally start with outline or survey books. They are designed for you, and you should read the relevant parts of them right through. It is helpful to re-read surveys when revising each paper, in order to refresh your memory and to remind yourself of the broader framework for the topic. They are also the most useful books to buy.Other books and articles will offer more advanced or specialised discussions. Remember that such sources may not be written primarily for you, so be discriminating; do not feel you need to read all of them from cover to cover. But you must try to gain a sense of the overall argument, and to use your ingenuity in finding your way to the material which will be relevant to you.Start on this by reading and noting the introductory and concluding sections. Reviews of books often offer a useful pointer to their argument (and flaws): they are easily found on the internet using Google or JSTOR. But summaries are not enough. You also need to consult the text at length, in order to deepen your understanding of the work and extend the range of examples drawn from it.Start by using the table of contents and the index as a guide. Make notes on each work on separate pieces of paper or in different computer files, since you may wish to reorder them later. It can help to copy out significant sentences, but you will engage with the argument more if you rephrase it in your own words. Any worthwhile book or article will have a distinctive argument. Before moving to the next item, stand back and summarise the whole work in two or three sentences. What did it say? What sources did it use? Did it open up a new approach? Try to be critical. And remember that you are making notes for two purposes. You are collecting information, which you will then be synthesising in your essay. But the notes will also assist your examination revision. You are preparing a large topic on which a number of questions might be asked in Tripos, from different angles. Hence it is important to consult past examination papers. If you limit yourself too much while taking notes, your exam revision might suffer. If you do not have time to read an article or chapter which looks useful for the topic, return to it in the vacation or in revision. When it comes to the exam, being able to revise from notes taken during the supervision, as well as from the essay and your lecture notes, will provide the most rounded understanding of the topic; however, it is extremely valuable to broaden your reading beyond the sources you have covered for the supervision essay.No one will tell you how to plan your working day. Learning self-discipline and organisation is one of the major tasks of the university student. But it is reasonable to expect you to work 40-48 hours a week during term-time. Such work includes lectures, supervisions, seminars, and independent study. In general, especially in Part I, you will have one supervision a week, in addition to several hours of lectures, seminars, and college classes. In Part II, you will have weekly meetings of Special Subjects in addition to supervisions, lectures, and classes in Specified Subject(s) and dissertations. You are also expected to work over the breaks between terms, as these periods are ideal for further reading, note-taking, and consolidation of material.The Easter Term of your second year should be dedicated to revision. Your Director of Studies will normally encourage you to attend revision supervisions, and will also give you advice about planning your work at this point. It is essential to practice writing timed essays in revision; for this, it is simplest to use questions from past Tripos papers.  Prelim to Part I exams are taken after Easter in the first year. This is a valuable practice examination, for which you should prepare in depth during the Easter vacation. It is essential to remember that you are a full-time student, though you may be in Cambridge itself for less than half of the year. Obviously you should relax and develop other skills in part of your vacations. But you must also go over the work of the previous term. You will find that a review of your book and lecture notes, combined with some extra reading, will greatly help your understanding of individual topics and their interconnections. You should also lay some groundwork for the following term‘s work, by reading some general surveys. A rule of thumb for the vacation period is to spend one week resting or on holiday, and to divide the remaining time between reviewing the most recent paper you have covered, preparing for the paper to be studied in the following term, and/or revising individual topics, as your workload demands. Being organised is one of the most important routes to success in Tripos.  Tripos is more than the sum of its parts, and performing well depends on reading broadly and, to some extent, reflecting on the theoretical issues which underpin historical narrative and analysis. A Historical Argument and Practice paper is obligatory both in the first-year Preliminary examination, and at Part II. Historical Argument and Practice is not a supervised paper, so the responsibility for preparing for these examinations is primarily your own. It is also generally valuable to set your work for individual Tripos papers in a broader context, by reading about historical methodology and related disciplines of interest to you, such as literature, history of art, political philosophy and Third World development. Although you will take the initiative on Historical Argument and Practice, your college should also arrange year-group classes and the Faculty offers a full programme of lectures. Take advantage also of other discussion opportunities, such as college History Societies, whose meetings are often advertised on Faculty circulars or noticeboards.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It offers detailed guidance on how to avoid plagiarism and poor academic practice.Plagiarism applies not only to the Part I Themes and Sources Long Essay, Part II Dissertation and Part II Special Subject Long Essay, but also generally to all work submitted to the Faculty as a part of its programme of teaching and examination. Students are urged to study the university policy and our local guidance carefully and to ensure that they understand it and abide by it. The Faculty is licensed to use the anti-plagiarism software, ‘Turnitin’ and reserves the right to subject students’ examination work to searches. The Faculty publishes a Style Guide, which advises on the best form in which to provide footnotes and bibliographies. This guide applies to all coursework submitted for examination in the Historical Tripos. Students are enjoined to study this Guide carefully and to ensure that they understand it and abide by it. It is most pertinent to Themes and Sources long essays and Part II dissertations, but may also be used if you decide to annotate your weekly essays; this is not obligatory, but is a valuable discipline. You may also find it useful to consult the following:The Faculty recognises that students may wish to record lectures for a variety of reasons.  This is permissible under certain conditions, as follows: The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It gives information about the title, organisers and time of all undergraduate lectures and classes. The later part lists lectures for graduate students. These do not directly concern you, but some welcome undergraduates as well as postgraduates. You should remember that the Lecture List is compiled during the summer preceding the academic year which it covers. Inevitably, some of the information is overtaken by events such as illness, lecturers’ need to reschedule lectures, etc. It is therefore important to check your emails and the Lecture List regularly for revisions, particularly at the start of each term.Timetables are available on the Faculty website. They are also displayed on the main noticeboard and screens in the Faculty, and you can download a personalised timetable via the University timetable system. You will normally receive emails via Moodle concerning any changes, but you should always check the screen and noticeboard outside the Custodians’ Office in the Faculty Building: details of sudden cancellations or alterations are put up there. Most, but not all, history lectures take place in the History Faculty building. If you are in any doubt please go to the General Enquiries Office on the 4th floor.Most lecturers are in the employment of the University and/or Colleges, but a few are spending a limited term of one or two years in Cambridge, for example as Pitt Professor of American History, or have been invited from outside Cambridge to substitute for a lecturer on leave. The majority of the lecturers are highly experienced, but naturally there are always novices or near-novices who may or may not lecture better than their elders. While the lectures are primarily for the benefit of students, they are also intended to give your academics such as Junior Research Fellows a chance to gain experience. Please remember this - and bear in mind that lectures with rough edges can in the long run prove useful.Many Part I lectures are intended to be introductory, to serve as guides to periods which you may be studying in British, European, World or American outline Papers. Or they will be offering the background and interpretations of texts set for Political Thought papers. These general lectures are intended to supply you with information and also with a broad interpretation of a period or theme, by means of an expert overview. They should fill in gaps between the topics you study for your supervisions. The views which you hear from a lecturer may differ from those expressed by your supervisor, especially when the topic is controversial. History is not a discipline which encourages a party-line. A good lecturer will make plain the origins and strengths of alternative interpretations, and if you feel he/she is skating over something it is open to you to ask a question. The teaching of nearly all Part I papers involves a series of “core” lectures which set out the general themes. Some lectures are more specialised, especially the short courses of up to four lectures. These are designed to shed light on one or two historical problems or themes. They may only relate to one or two potential questions in Tripos, but you may find that they provide unexpected sidelights on other topics, or simply that they are interesting. Often they present research that is as yet unpublished. It is difficult to generalise about lectures and lecture-attendance for Part I or for Part II: different people respond to and gain from the same lecture in different ways. There is no obligation to attend, or to keep attending after you have been to the first one or two lectures of a course (even if the lecturer is known to you). But do remember that the “heavy” or intellectually demanding lectures may be stretching you more than the “instant access” ones; lectures are not TV sound-bites, and although many good ones are entertaining, some, which can make you think long afterwards, are not. You should ask your Director of Studies about planning your lecture attendance across the year. Some lectures may only be given in a term before the ones when you are supervised for a Paper. Your supervisor will probably also have suggestions as to which lectures to attend for the Paper he/she is teaching you or try asking someone in the year above you. It is important, especially in the case of outline lecture courses, that you should at least sample them. And sampling means going to at least two weeks of them. Often it is only when revising that you realise the full value of a lecture course. Lecturers will often pause during a lecture for questions, or will leave time for questions at the end. Even if they do not, it is your right to put up your hand and ask a questions, whether for a date, or the spelling of a name, or a more general point. The Faculty recognises the value of dialogue in the learning process - although pressure of time may preclude an extended discussion in class. Note-taking at lectures becomes easier with practice and depends on what you are getting out of a particular course. If the factual material is fairly familiar or easily accessible in a textbook there is little point in writing down the data provided in the lecture. Try to identify the main themes and arguments in the lecture, rather than writing down all that is said. Headings and sub-headings make a big difference, when you come to revise from your notes. And if the themes remain obscure to you, you can ask the lecturer at the end.The Themes and Sources paper is taught almost exclusively by means of the classes organised by the Faculty. It is therefore essential that you attend all the classes and that you try to prepare for them as carefully as possible. Attendance will be taken at each class. Unless a medical or other serious personal reason for absence is presented at the time with supporting evidence if required, students who fail to demonstrate reasonable attendance at Themes and Sources classes will be considered to have forfeited their entitlement to a Themes and Sources supervision arranged by the Faculty. Students often ask about the time they should devote to Themes and Sources preparation alongside their other papers. Reading speeds vary, and your rate is likely to accelerate as you become more familiar with the subject-matter, but around four hours’ reading for each class is a reasonable norm. More detailed guidelines about Themes and Sources will be issued to you and information will be available on the website in advance of a Faculty presentation about the options in mid-October. Long Essay questions will be distributed toward the end of May. During the classes, the teachers will introduce the Long Essay exercise and give general guidance about research and writing. You will also be given a single, 30-45 minute supervision, to be arranged by the class teachers, on your choice of topic for the Long Essay, including recommended reading. It is essential to give thought to your choice of topic in advance in order to make the most of this supervision. The Faculty Board prohibits any further supervision on the preparation of the Long Essay, whether from a class teacher, supervisor or Director of Studies. The formats in which the Long Essays are set vary somewhat between options: you may find it useful to consult past examination papers and if still in doubt, ask your Option Convenor. The basic requirement for all the Long Essays is that you should show accurate knowledge of the subject that you are discussing, awareness of the different interpretations which may be placed on the evidence, and judgement in setting out your own arguments and conclusions. The 5,000-word maximum for the Long Essay may not sound too demanding, but you are strongly advised to write at least a first draft during the Long Vacation: the following Michaelmas Term will bring many other tasks.These are more tightly geared to Tripos Papers than are the Part I lectures, and students miss them at their peril. Lectures and Classes are the only form of teaching provided for the Special Subjects, so you will largely be working on your own, preparing for the weekly classes. The Special Subject and Specified Papers available in the following academic year are announced on the website at the very end of the Lent term. It is important that you find out as much as possible about these, so that you can make an informed choice when asked to list your preferences in Easter term. Each of the lecturers giving a Special Subject will hold an introductory session early in the Easter Term. You will also gain an idea of what is expected from the reading-lists for Part II papers, available on the website. Also, try asking students already taking a paper, and consult your Director of Studies. The Academic Secretary is responsible for the process of assigning students to Part II papers; all Special Subjects and some Specified Papers have limited class sizes, so bear in mind that you may not always get your first choice.Graduate seminars are chiefly meant for announcing research findings, and senior members and research students give papers at them, but many welcome undergraduates. It is difficult to predict, even from a title, whether you will find a paper interesting or useful, but discussions afterwards often throw up new insights or a fresh approach to a topic. It is well worth sampling a few seminars. Likewise with the Public Lectures which the Faculty or other Cambridge institutions lay on, for example, the Seeley, the Ellen McArthur, the Birkbeck and the Trevelyan lectures. They are not all offered every year but the University and/or the Faculty website will tell you what is available.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

If you receive a questionnaire please do fill it in: this will help us to respond to your needs and suggestions. Summaries of the Faculty's responses to issues raised by internal and national surveys are posted here.By now you will have met your Director of Studies and your Tutor, and they are obviously a first port of call if you have questions or difficulties, whether about an item or a reading-list, the lectures or supervisions you are attending, or Cambridge in general. Do not feel shy about approaching them on apparently minor practical matters: they can often in an instant point you in the right direction. Your Director of Studies has a number of responsibilities to you. The most important are to arrange your supervision efficiently, to monitor its effectiveness, to see you at the end of each term to discuss your progress, to help arrange your revision for examinations and to provide you with all necessary academic advice, guidance and information. He or she may well have regular "office hours" each week. You should expect a prompt response to emails asking a question or requesting an appointment. For more fundamental problems, such as supervisions which do not appear to you to be going well, it can sometimes be the supervisors themselves with whom you should raise the problem: you may be approaching your reading in the wrong way, or making avoidable and easily rectifiable errors in essay writing technique. But this is also an area where your Director of Studies will advise you.If you are seriously unhappy about the work you are doing, you may also find it helpful to talk to your Tutor. Your College Chaplain and/or Counsellor are there to offer you guidance on general problems but they can give you an informed second opinion or more practical matters, too.The administrative hub of the Faculty is on the 4th floor of the Faculty Building. If you cannot find the information you need from the noticeboards or information screens, you should go to the General Enquiries Office. This office is normally open from 9-5, weekdays in term time. Important messages relating to Tripos, or about relevant events which may of interest, will be sent to your @cam e-mail address, so please check this regularly.Other lines of communication lead to your Undergraduate Representatives on the History Faculty Board and to CUSU's Student Officers who are currently undergraduates or recent graduates. The representatives can give you advice on particular academic problems which you may have been encountering, and they will be interested to hear any general comments or proposals which you have on the syllabus or on History at Cambridge. If they find that your views are shared by, or acceptable to, a substantial number of other students, they may present them at the termly meeting of the Faculty's Teaching, Learning and Quality Committee on which five students sit.You may contact your Faculty Board undergraduate reps via the following email address: ugradreps@hist.cam.ac.uk.Elections for Faculty Board Student Representatives take place in the Michaelmas Term, and volunteers to serve on the Teaching, Learning and Quality Committee are chosen on a 'first-come first-served' basis in Lent Term.  Any student member of the History Faculty is welcome to put themselves forward.  If you are unhappy with the experience you have received from a University department, faculty, service or staff member, the University has a Student Complaints Procedure for you to use in order to try and resolve the situation. Details are available at www.studentcomplaints.admin.cam.ac.uk/student-complaints. The Responsible Officer in the Faculty is the Academic Secretary, Dr Emma Spary, academic.secretary@hist.cam.ac.uk. The University has robust policies in place to ensure that examination results are accurate. However, there may be circumstances where something unusual happens during the examination and you want it taken into account. The University has procedures in place to deal with this possibility.

To be able to read articles and books in foreign languages gives you a wider choice of reading-matter in Part I, and for some Part II Special and Specified Subjects or for certain dissertation projects, a foreign language is highly desirable. The Faculty does not have a formal programme for the teaching of languages. However, first year students who already have A/S or A2 (or equivalent) level in French or German may choose a Themes and Sources option involving the study of primary and secondary sources in either language. A language training element is built into the teaching of these courses.Time invested in improving language skills can now pay dividends later on in your studies. Some colleges provide supervision and, if this is of interest, you should consult your Director of Studies. The University Language Centre has a wide range of resources, all of which are free and well-worth investigating. The Seeley Library collects a copy of most books on undergraduate reading lists, when these are available in print or second-hand, and will be able to provide most of the reading material for your essays. It is also possible to recommend other titles for acquisition by using forms in the Library, via the web or email, giving the reason for your request and as many publication details as possible. You will also have access to the University Library; which is a ‘Legal Deposit’ institution, i.e. it receives a copy of every book published in the United Kingdom. There are several other Faculty Libraries with wide-ranging and potentially useful collections; the Modern and Medieval Languages, Classics, Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and Economics faculty libraries are all within a couple of minutes' walk on the Sidgwick Site and they are well worth exploring (though not all will permit you to borrow).There is, of course, also your college library. Though this cannot be as comprehensive a collection as the University Library or the Seeley, it does receive copies of reading lists and lists of the most heavily used Seeley titles to guide its History acquisitions and you can also make suggestions to your Director of Studies or Librarian. College libraries often provide a range of very useful sources for weekly essays.The Seeley Library contains a stock of videos and DVDs also recommended for particular papers and these may be borrowed or viewed in the Library’s audio-visual room. Copies of Themes and Sources study packs, with primary and secondary sources, are also available for reference in open-access library filing cabinets. You will find more detailed guidance about the Seeley Library and how to use the online catalogue in the Seeley’s web pages, in a library guide issued at registration (further copies can be obtained at the desk) and the staff will also advise on how to make the best use of the collections. Many thousands of online databases, journals and e-books are now networked within the University (and off-campus using passwords) and you can find further information on these on the University Library or Seeley web pages, and in leaflets available in the Seeley.Information about IT facilities in the History Faculty can be found here. The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

So long as the guidelines set out in Section I are observed, students may choose from any documented style for footnotes and bibliography, on condition that they apply it sensibly and consistently. They may wish to consult, for example, the style adopted by journals in the field of their submission, or the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), or the compact version thereof in Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, 8th ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013).This latitude for style choice has been introduced because academic styles vary widely among different journals and publishers, and it would be misleading to require students to adhere to a single system as if that were likely to be the only system required of them in the future. What students need to learn is to be consistent and clear in their use of any given style, and this is what the combination of compulsion and flexibility in this guide seeks to inculcate.Dates should be written in the form: 20 December 1148; 20 December; AD 245-50. Centuries should be written out (twenty-first century) and 1920s etc. should be written without an apostrophe.As explained in the introduction to this document, whereas the rules in Section I are compulsory, the style conventions given in this section (Section II) are recommended only. Section II outlines a style which you may choose to adopt for footnotes and bibliography, but you are not required to do so. This style has been adapted from the Cambridge University Press Humanities & Social Sciences Book Production Guide, drawing also at points on the Historical Journal notes for authors, with certain changes, additions and deletions to make it more practicable for undergraduates.The Cambridge University Press Guide for Humanities and Social Sciences at https://authornet.cambridge.org/information/productionguide/hss/ is normally available online. If you choose to use this style, you may consult the Guide for additional information on minor points, so long as in any case of conflict between the Guide and Section I of this document you follow the latter. You may alter the style for your own purposes so long as you are consistent (for example, medievalists and early modernists often omit the name of the publisher as this is either irrelevant or unknown for manuscripts and for early printed books). Alternatively, you may use any other consistent and documented style that you choose so long as you adhere to the requirements in Section I. At the risk of repetition, it must be stressed that the crucial issue is consistency within a single piece of work.The style convention for footnotes given here is to give a full reference at the first citation, and then author-plus-short-title in subsequent citations. The examples below use lower case in titles except for proper nouns; this should always be followed in the case of French and Latin titles, but in English and German titles either upper case or lower case may be used for non-trivial words in book titles.First (or ‘full’) reference to books, articles, and manuscript source may be given as in the following examples (you may choose between giving authors’ names exactly as in their works, and using initials-plus-surname for all authors), giving where relevant the specific page number(s) to which you are referring:(Aldershot: Variorum, 1995).A. T. Runnock, Medieval fortress building, new edn, 2 vols., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), vol. I, pp.135-7. [Here ‘pp.135-7’ are the specific pages to which reference is being made; there is alternatively a different convention, of dropping the ‘p.’ or ‘pp.’ when a volume number is cited, as it is here.]Charles Taylor, ‘The hermeneutics of conflict’, in Meaning and context: Quentin Skinner and his critics, ed. James Tully (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988), 218-28. [Here ‘218-28’ is the complete page range of the chapter.]Journal articles:Essays and Studies 11 (1958), 34-48. [Here ‘11’ is the volume number, which must be given, and ‘34-48’ is the complete page range of the article. As the Salter example shows, it is not necessary to give the journal issue number or month in addition to the volume. If you do decide to adopt a convention of giving either issue number or month (which must be done consistently), omit the other: so either Journal of American History 91:4 (2005), or Journal of American History 91 (March 2005), but not Journal of American History 91:4 (March 2005).]Arthur Jerrold Tieje, ‘A peculiar phase of the theory of realism in pre-Richardsonian fiction’, PMLA 28 (1913), 213-52, at p.214. [Here PMLA would have to have been explained in an abbreviations list, otherwise spelt out here at first reference.]Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh, 15 December 1748, ‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, Forster collection, XI, fol. 7, Harvard University.H. R. Southall, ‘Regional unemployment patterns in Britain, 1851 to 1914’, unpublished PhD thesis, University of Cambridge (1984), p. 72.Use common sense to construct a consistent system of referencing. Include the date produced and for films, the country and director. Example: Kate Nickerson [Arnold Manoff nom de plume], writer, and Sidney Lumet, director, ‘The Death of Socrates: 399 B.C.’, episode of ‘You Are There’, CBS, national USA broadcast, 3 May 1953.After the first mention, references to the source in the notes should take a shortened form. A shortened reference includes only the last name of the author and an improvised short title for the book (containing the key word or words from the main title, so as to make the reference easily recognisable and not to be confused with any other work), followed by the page number of the reference. Thus:Books:Rousseau and Rogers (eds.), Enduring legacy, p. 45. Runnock, Medieval fortress building, p. 74.Articles:Salter, ‘Pilgrimage to truth’, pp.34-5. Tieje, ‘A peculiar phase’, p.75.Manuscript material:Southall, ‘Regional unemployment’, p. 72.‘Richardson / Bradshaigh letters’, fol. 116.BN n.a.fr. 20628 (Thiers Papers), fol. 279.The author may be separated from the short title, e.g. in footnote formulations such as:You may choose to use ‘Ibid.’ [no italics] to refer to the work mentioned in the immediately preceding reference, so long as there is no danger of confusion.So:But not: The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

In the third year, you can choose from over thirty specialised options from within these same time-spans, and to write a dissertation on a topic of your own choosing.Certain requirements must be fulfilled, however, and it is important that you choose your papers for Parts I and II with guidance from your Director of Studies, within the constraints of Tripos regulations.  These regulations are set out in the University Statutes and Ordinances, and summarised below:PART I: Candidates must offer Paper 1 and five other papers, as follows:PART II: Candidates who take the examination in the year following Part I, must offer:NB: Guidance for students transferring into History Part II from another Tripos can be found here.All candidates must offer in either Part I or Part II:Papers currently meeting the PRE-1750 requirement are:Part I:1.   Themes and Sources options (NB: These papers are variable and may not be offered each year):(i)      Money and society from late antiquity to the financial revolution (ii)     Royal & princely courts: ancient, medieval and modern(vii)   Nature and the city in medieval thought(viii)   Sacred histories  2.   British political history, 380 - 11003.   British political history, 1050 - 15094.   British political history, 1485 - 1714 7.   British economic and social history, 380 - 11008.   British economic and social history, 1050 - c.15009.   British economic and social history, c.1500 - 175012.

The long road to modernisation: Spain since 1808  The regulations also state that:A note about overlap:Students worry about the extent to which they may repeat material within or between papers. The only rules are (1) that some exam papers specifically forbid candidates from answering starred questions if they are also candidates for certain other papers (usually those covering overlapping periods); and (2) that in choosing a Part II dissertation topic, there may not be overlap with the choice of other Part II papers, nor significant overlap with the Themes and Sources Long Essay. Beyond this, the overlap issue is a matter of common sense. It is unwise to repeat material within a paper, because it will give a marker a sense that a candidate’s knowledge is narrow; or between papers, because if the candidate is discussed at the Exam Board it will again give an impression of limitation. However, this need not rule out judicious use of an occasional example in different argumentative contexts. This is especially so in the case of the Part II HAP paper, where you are encouraged to use material from other Part II papers to illustrate a broad theme; though the point of a general paper is to go beyond the scope of one particular field of history.(Revised September 2017)The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

There were many continuities, of course; even the 'revolutionary' nature of the 'industrial revolution' is nowadays contested. Even so, the impact of new wealth and goods, and of new patterns of work and urban living, was certainly greater than in any previous period of British history, and this impact was socially and culturally transformative. This paper introduces you both to the economic processes which effected this change and to the ways in which Britons of diverse ranks experienced and thought about their unstable world and behaved within it.As the reading list shows, the themes from which you may choose your eight essay topics are diverse. You will not be able to cover all the themes or all the chronology. Guided by your supervisor, you will have to make choices. Some of you will choose to sample economic, social and cultural themes broadly. Others may wish to specialise a little -- on economic or demographic history, say. In this case, you may study how changes in demography, in agriculture and trade, in labour and capital supply, and in consumption and demand underpinned economic growth in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Or you may study changes in the distribution of wealth and living standards, the changing role of the state, and the supposed 'retardation' of the economy towards the end of the period.Others may prefer to focus on some of the social and cultural adaptations which characterised the period. You may study shifts in the manners and sensibilities of affluent or upwardly mobile classes, for example, or the problems of poverty, the growth of literacy among the poor and of educational provision at all levels, or the distance and overlap between elite and popular cultures. You may explore how art and literature commented on the dynamism and perils of this rapidly evolving society, or how national and ethnic identities took shape, or how gender roles and sexual relationships changed, or how the conflicts between 'haves' and 'have-nots' were accommodated or contained. The histories of class consciousness, riot, and crime are on offer here.Note, however, that the distinctions between 'economic', 'social' and 'cultural' history are artificial. For example, you cannot understand demographic history without a knowledge of sexual and gender relations, and vice versa; and family history was shaped by economic change, and vice versa.As you can see, the paper is studied thematically rather than chronologically, so you may find it helpful to complete work on the parallel 'political' paper (Paper 5) first. This is not essential, however. In the long run, both papers will intermesh to give you a richly patterned view of the period.As with other Part I papers, eight core lectures in Michaelmas term will introduce you to key themes and interpretations in the paper. Otherwise you will be expected to attend a sensible selection of the 'outline' and 'thematic' lectures listed on the other side of this brochure. These lectures are continued across both Michaelmas and Lent terms, but, even if you are taking the paper in Lent, you should attend the lectures in Michaelmas by way of preparation for your later work. The 'thematic' lectures are invaluable if you wish to be led more deeply into the territories they cover: they are essential tools for the paper. Paper 10 reading listPaper 10 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart I *Image by: Penny Mayes The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The pace of change accelerated at the end of the nineteenth century and seemed to throw Britain (ahead of much of the rest of the developed world) headlong into a new era, eventually denoted 'modernity'.Britain became the first and for some time the only fully urbanized nation. Its economy grew rapidly but unevenly, so that the 'class society' widely predicted in the nineteenth century was only in the twentieth realized. Steam power, harnessed a century earlier, finally made its full impact felt, enmeshing the comparatively open British economy in a global web; the advent of electronic communications at about the same time meant that globalization had tremendous cultural implications, too. Mass media shaped a mass society. 'World wars' rent the social fabric, and reknit it into new forms.By 1945 the British had already seen a lot of industrialization, urbanization, 'modernity' and 'mass society'. Thus they experienced what Hobsbawm has called the 'golden age' of the post-1945 world in a more worldly-wise, even jaded mood than did many other Europeans - yet these new jolts of technological, social and cultural change lost none of their force, little of their capacity to surprise and confuse. Historians are still puzzling over the 'contemporary' history of Britain. You will have a chance to puzzle with them, and, more than in other papers with a highly developed historiography, to find your own evidence and to venture your own interpretations.Reading material is hardly lacking, although some of it is drawn from sociology and cultural studies - even journalism - rather than conventional historical writing. You will need to work to fit this quasi-primary material into a mature historical framework - good practice in thinking like an historian. The full range of human experience is on offer, so you and your supervisor will have to make stern choices - to sample all of the sub-disciplines or to specialize. One choice you will probably not have to make is chronological: most students should be able to cover the full chronological range of this relatively short paper.Second year students taking Part I in 2014 should note that, if you are also being examined in the contiguous and overlapping Paper 10, then you may not answer questions on the period 1870-1914 in the Paper 10 examination but you may answer questions on this period in Paper 11. Some of you may also be examined in the parallel political history Paper 6; on the whole, the distinctions in subject matter between these papers are clear, but if you are concerned ask your supervisor.As with other Part I papers, eight core lectures in Michaelmas term will introduce you to key themes and interpretations in the paper. Otherwise you will be expected to attend a sensible selection of the 'outline' and 'thematic' lectures listed on the next page. These lectures are continued across two terms but, even if you are being supervised for the paper in Lent, you should attend the lectures in Michaelmas (especially the core lectures) by way of preparation for your later work. Lectures are offered at different levels of specialization and sophistication to allow students to explore the terrain and to follow up more closely areas of special interest: they are essential tools for the paper. Paper 11 reading listPaper 11 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

There are two main points of focus: Classical Greece of the fifth and fourth centuries BC, and Republican and early Imperial Rome from the turn of the third century BC to the mid-first century AD. Topics that are specifically Greek include Athenian democracy and culture, Spartan politics, society and foreign policy, Alexander the Great and Thucydides. Topics that are specifically Roman include Roman imperialism, the politics and constitution of the Republic, Roman religion, the establishment of the Principate by Augustus, the character and presentation of imperial power in the early Empire, and Tacitus. Topics that span both Greek and Roman history include gender and sexuality, and slavery.As with other Part I papers, core lectures in the Michaelmas Term will provide an outline of Greek or Roman history, and introduce you to key themes and interpretations in the paper; these are supported by eight lectures on ancient historical texts. Otherwise you will be expected to attend a sensible selection of the more thematic and historiographical/methodological lecture series listed below depending on whether you are focusing on Greek or Roman history and your particular interests.Lectures will be delivered in the Classics Faculty Building (on the Sidgwick site).The attached bibliographies concentrate on key items aimed at providing suggestive and interesting introductions to the various topics and the issues and controversies they involved.  They cut across rather than duplicate the division of material that is reflected in the organisation of the lectures. They are unashamedly selective; deliberately not exhaustive.  Taken together, they should give some idea of what this paper has to offer, and of the sheer fascinating variety of issues which confront any historian of the ancient world.Paper 12 reading listPaper 12 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The nature of that rule - provincial government, the imperial cult, the presentation of imperial power - is central to any understanding of the first two centuries AD. Why were some emperors (Caligula, Nero, Commodus) viewed as "bad", while others (Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius) were praised for their virtues?The course also examines the economic and social history of the Empire, looking in particular at the absorption of Greek culture by the Roman elite, at slavery, and at early Christianity. It then moves on to consider the extent to which this 'old world' of the early Empire survived the upheavals of the so-called Third Century Crisis and the impact of the reforms of both Diocletian and the Christian emperor Constantine. The theme of change is central for a consideration of the rise of Christianity in the fourth and fifth centuries and for understanding the shift in government to a more highly centralised and ceremonial monarchy.This is an often unsettling journey through a late-Antique world of distant god-like emperors, wild ascetic holy men, great saints, excitable virgins, charismatic heretics, oppressive bureaucrats and violent barbarians. The last named are significant. In looking at the so-called "decline and fall" of the Roman Empire, it is important to ask why the empire "fell" in the West but survived largely intact in the East.The middle part of the course concentrates on the period from the fifth to the eighth centuries. The fading away of the structures of the Roman state in the West in the fifth century led to the emergence of various 'barbarian' successor kingdoms, each influenced to a greater or lesser extent by Roman institutions, but also by the social traditions and martial culture of the 'barbarian' newcomers. The different kingdoms are examined, as too is the position of the popes in Rome.At the same time, consideration is given to the history of the surviving eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Justinian's attempts to restore the fortunes of the empire through internal reform and wars of reconquest are studied, as too is the social and economic history of the Mediterranean world at this time, which witnessed the first great outbreak of bubonic plague. The difficulties faced by the emperors of Constantinople in the late sixth century, the impact of warfare first with Persia, and then with an expansionist Islamic foe, and the response of the eastern, or 'Byzantine', empire to this phenomenon in the form of 'iconoclasm' are addressed. Consideration is given to the emergence of a vibrant and distinctive Islamic culture in the lands conquered by the Arabs.The latter part of the paper covers part of the period of Frankish and Carolingian dominance in western Europe in the eighth and ninth centuries, a time of remarkable political and cultural coherence, combined with crucial, very diverse and formative developments in every sphere of life. A principal focus is the expansion of Frankish rule eastwards and southwards into Germany, Italy and Spain, and the rise of the Carolingians under Pippin III, Charlemagne, Louis the Pious and Charles the Bald, an unbroken line of succession in the male line. Their interaction within the realms with the aristocracy, the church and the female members of their elite groups, as well as with external rivals and enemies such as the Vikings, the Slavs and Byzantium, is examined.Social adjustments, economic change and the establishment of a distinctive intellectual and cultural tradition in western Europe that drew strongly on the Roman past throughout the period from the fourth century onwards, are explored in relation to the wealth and variety of primary sources surviving from this period. Among the written sources - narrative, legislative, legal, epistolary and poetic - there is much now available in English translation. There are also many other categories of historical evidence exploited, such as archaeology, artefacts, architecture, art and coinage.SURVEY LECTURESThe lectures are designed as an essential survey of the entire period covered by the course.

The historical processes that took place during these centuries have been described as 'the making of Europe' and 'the first European revolution'. Many aspects of our society that we take for granted today have their origin in this period. To name but a few: lawyers, the political units that gave rise to the modern states, banking, and marriage by mutual consent.At the same time, the central Middle Ages were in many respects very different from our own epoch. Christianity was a defining characteristic of life; personal bonds rather than faceless bureaucracies dominated, and no sharp separation existed between public and private. The period is characterized both by the great territorial expansion of Christendom and the rise of new political, religious and economic systems. New regions joined Christendom: Scandinavia and Central Europe converted to Catholic Christianity, the Balkans and Rus' to Greek Orthodoxy. European expansion also proceeded through warfare, notably in Iberia and the Baltic, and crusaders even began the conquest of areas outside Europe.Within Europe, new governmental systems developed with the rise of new monarchies, and the papacy emerged as the effective head of the Catholic Church. Europe's economy started to change through the emergence of a money economy and international trade. The 'twelfth-century Renaissance' led to a renewal of the intellectual life. A search for greater involvement in religious life led to the rise of lay religious movements, some accepted, others branded as heretical by ecclesiastics. Such dramatic social, political and economic changes also led to confrontation and persecution. An increasing hostility to non-Catholic Christians, including heretics; warfare against Muslims conceived as 'holy war'; and the persecution of Jews (including pogroms and the invention of accusations such as the ritual murder of Christian children by Jews) also emerged during this period.The paper offers both a wide geographical scope encompassing not just western Europe but all of Europe; and a range of themes including (but not limited to) individual kingdoms, the church and religious institutions, the economy, marriage and the family, and the history of minorities. The lecture course is integrated with the supervision topics. Students should attend all lectures to get a good overview of the whole period, but they can select topics according to their own interests for supervision.Paper 14 reading listPaper 14 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Christian relations with another religion, Judaism, were marked by increasing persecution.It was a period of great cultural ferment, not merely in Italy, which became the home of a remarkable revival of classical art and letters, but also at princely courts in northern Europe, where magnificent display and the cult of chivalry reached new levels of extravagance. Yet this was also a period of dramatic social and economic change, in which the Black Death wiped out a third or more of the population of western Europe, turning topsy turvy the social structure of town and country as land values fell, labour became expensive, and rebellions broke out in Italian, Flemish, and French towns.The paper is intended to cover all facets of European history in the period, including social, cultural, intellectual and institutional, as well as economic, political and ecclesiastical history. The emphasis will be on Western and Southern Europe, although Eastern Europe will not be neglected. Some attention will be paid to European relations with other parts of the world.The book list is designed to suggest suitable topics for supervision but it by no means excludes other possibilities. The paper is treated in a sufficiently comprehensive way to allow individual undergraduates to concentrate on specific themes within the period and there are no compulsory questions, although undergraduates are encouraged to tackle a broad range of topics and should read more widely then required for supervisions, to place specific knowledge in a wider context. Because there are papers in the Tripos on British history and Political Thought, no questions will be set on these subjects but lecturers may allude to them in passing and undergraduates should also feel free to do so.Paper 15 reading listPaper 15 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Europe witnessed its first media revolution. It became global through discoveries of New Worlds. Rulers fought rebels and tried to regularise peoples' behaviour. The Reformation divided Christianity and countries. Witches were prosecuted.The seventeenth century saw the first major European confessional and state war, which lasted for Thirty Years. Law and diplomacy became increasingly important. Concepts of liberty were contested and redefined, so as to meet or query the new ideology of 'reason of state'. The Enlightenment emanated from such debates, as did the early modern experience of negotiating passion and reason, individual needs and the common good.So this is a paper which charts key developments in European history and allows you to engage with many fascinating ideas and people. Carlo Ginzburg's The Cheese and the Worms, introduces you to an Italian village miller who was burnt by the Inquisition for his heretical ideas, and Natalie Davis' Return of Martin Guerre to a French woman who pretended that her husband was dead in order to live with another man. Then there is 'high culture', with Renaissance feminists, the humanist Montaigne, an extraordinary Venetian rabbi, Leon of Modena, and new seventeenth-century 'scientific' philosophers, such as Descartes. We focus on providing you with lectures and supervisions on topics which give you a coherent sense of the period and let you engage with people's subjectivities and lives.Paper 16 reading listPaper 16 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

That is revealed by the frequent use of the word "revolution" to describe some of its major events - The French Revolution, the Revolutions of 1848, the romantic revolution and the industrial revolution. The roots of another great revolution - the Russian Revolution of 1917 - stretch back deep into the nineteenth century.Other changes such as the "disenchantment of the world" by the Enlightenment, the transformation of the role and position of women, the urbanisation of European society, the rise and fall of Napoleon or the unification of Italy and Germany, were of comparable scale and importance.Virtually all the movements which formed the modern world - secularism, liberalism, Marxism, democracy, romanticism, conservatism, modernism, anarchism, terrorism (to mention just a few) were creations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. No proper understanding of the world in which we live can be achieved without knowledge and understanding of these dramatic times.Always one of the most successful and popular papers in the Tripos, Paper 17 has been restructured to provide students with a course of lectures which:At the heart of the teaching for this paper is a twice-weekly course of lectures given by a team of experts.

The years from the fall of Bismarck to the fall of the Soviet Empire saw two cataclysmic world wars, mass destruction on a scale unparalleled in history, genocide and racial extermination of a systematic nature and degree previously unknown, economic depression and hyperinflation that still provide textbook examples of economic disaster, ideological conflict of a depth and bitterness seldom seen since the religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the rise and fall of fascism and communism, movements more extreme than almost any previously encountered.Playing a central role in many of the processes of historical change were major figures such as Lenin and Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini, Clemenceau and De Gaulle. Their contribution will be fully assessed in the course.Finally, the twentieth century witnessed unprecedented progress and prosperity, astonishing technological inventiveness, the emancipation of women and the liberation of sexuality, the rise of the welfare state, the spread of democratic politics, the flowering of modernist culture, the rebellion of the young, and the growth of European unity.Taking this course offers a unique opportunity to look back at the past century of European history from an informed point of view and to try to make sense of it all.At the heart of the teaching for this paper is a twice-weekly course of lectures given by a team of experts. Beginning with six general lectures, which identify and explain the central themes in the political social, economic and cultural developments of the period, the course then covers the major events and developments in all these fields from 1890 to the present.Always one of the most successful and popular papers in the Tripos, Paper 18 has been restructured to provide students with a course of lectures which is :The examination for Paper 18 will be divided into two sections, A and B, and candidates will be required to answer at least one question from each section, plus one from either, making a total of three.

How did Christian thinkers cope intellectually with the extraordinary changes in the political status of the early church? Was Aristotle an apologist for ancient slavery? Why and how did early modern thinkers draw on the inheritance of the ancients in debates over sovereignty and freedom? These are some of the important questions which this paper will enable you to explore, as you encounter some of the classic texts in the origin of Western political thought and come to understand the way that they expressed and engaged with the intellectual controversies and assumptions of their times.Like Paper 20/4, this paper offers two kinds of intellectual adventure. In Part A, you will focus on a close reading of major texts within political and intellectual contexts. This allows you to explore how philosophical argument and analysis emerges within an historical period and so to develop philosophical skills within the Historical Tripos (or Human, Social and Political Sciences Tripos for those borrowing this paper). In Part B, you will focus on groups of texts which are thematically and historically connected, developing your ability to understand the way that a given political language is inflected, used and challenged in specific historical circumstances. For those considering doing other papers in the history of political thought or who have done them, this paper will provide a crucial basis to enrich and deepen your understanding of the foundations of modern politics.Because the material to be covered is both diverse and especially challenging in that many students will not have studied the history of political thought before, more lectures are offered for this paper than for some others. This need not cause you alarm as you are not required or expected to attend them all since you will cover in supervision only 7 or 8 of the 30 named topics, and need answer in the examination only on 3. There is a convention that (at least) one examination question will be set on every named A and B topic. The result of all this is that you have the opportunity in conjunction with your supervisor to chart your own intellectual pathway through this paper. You may choose to concentrate entirely on ancient and medieval material, or on medieval and early modern, or to choose some other combination of thinkers and topics recommended by your supervisor.The Reading List is the invaluable guide and resource which lists all of the topics with specified primary reading and recommended secondary reading. This leaflet is to be read in conjunction with the Reading List and will help you select those lectures which will be most relevant to your chosen topics, as well as those which are closely related, since you will often benefit from attending lectures on topics closely related to your specific supervision topics as well. Note that lectures from other Faculties may be included in this list because the expertise in the history of political thought in Cambridge is shared among several Faculties.The lecturers will Paper 19 reading listPaper 19 course guide   Useful online resourcesPast Papers:Part IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It examines the emergence of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the shifting power relations between them, and compares structures and practices of kingship in England with those elsewhere in the British Isles, as well as the political impact of conversion to Christianity.The Viking invasions of the ninth century and their political consequences throughout the British Isles form a major theme, as does the expansion of the power of the kings of Wessex, their changing conception of their power, and the eventual conquest of all of England during the tenth century to create the first kingdom of the English, processes which may be compared and contrasted with contemporary developments elsewhere in the British Isles.The final part of the paper examines the consequences of two successive continental conquests of England during the eleventh century-by the Danes in 1016 and by the Normans in 1066, and also considers the impact of the latter in Wales and Scotland.The paper as a whole is marked by an emphasis upon the primary sources, both written (such as narrative histories, charters, laws) and material (such as coins), an understanding of which greatly enriches the experience of appreciating what was different as well as what we recognize as familiar in the early history of these islands.For the period before c.1066, the Anglo-Saxon England bibliography compiled by Professor S.D. Keynes is essential. For the period after 1050, see the booklist for Paper 3. For the history of Celtic Britain and Ireland, see the Bibliography for Papers 2 and 7.The lectures for the paper comprise a course of eight core lectures and a number of more specialized courses of lectures provided by both the History Faculty and early medievalists from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (ASNC) and the Department of Archaeology. Because of the closely interconnected nature of political, religious, social and economic developments during the early medieval period, some of the lectures listed will be of relevance to both Papers 2 and 7. Students with a special interest in the history of Celtic Britain and Ireland should consult the Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Lecture List for more specialized courses of lectures.Paper 2 course guidePaper 2 bibliographyGlossaryUseful online resourcesPast exam papers: The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

The course examines the early modern expansion of Spain and Portugal into the Caribbean, central and South America and the history of Atlantic slavery. It analyses the 'first age of global imperialism' between 1760 and 1830, when the European powers, and especially the British, began to establish territorial empires in Asia and Africa. It considers the economic, political and strategic reasons behind the Partition of Africa and the battle for concessions in the Far East in the late nineteenth century. But this is not simply a European-centred course. It also examines the indigenous civilisations, economies and states of the Americas, Africa and Asia in their own terms. The resistance and adaptation of non-European peoples to western economic penetration, political dominance and evangelisation occupies centre stage in lectures and supervisions. The course ends with a consideration of Asian and African nationalisms in their early stages.Paper 21 reading listPaper 21 course guideUseful online resourcesPast papers: Prelim to Part IPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

This paper concentrates on American beginnings, looking broadly at the diverse, violent, entangled, and enthralling worlds created by Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in North America in the period. The ramifications of choices made in this period— in terms of cultural contact, labour, slavery, race, gender, politics, sexuality, war, and religion—remain with us still.  The paper tracks regional development across a broad range of American colonies and states, settled by the British, the Spanish, and the French, in mainland America as well as the Caribbean.  The critical importance of Native Americans, Africans, and African-Americans also receives attention.  The paper considers the origins, course, and outcomes of the American Revolution, as well as the ways in which all kinds of people influenced colonial, revolutionary, and national trajectories.  It also attends to specific moments of American confrontation and conflict, including its greatest such moment, the Civil War.  Lectures include discussion both of historical developments and of larger historiographical debates in this field, as well as on primary sources generated by the American experience.Paper 22 reading listPaper 22 Course GuideUseful online resources for Paper 22Past Papers:Part I  Convenor:  Dr Julia GuarneriThis paper examines the history of the United States from the end of the Civil War in 1865 to the present.

The notion of a 'Third World' emerged very much as the legacy of these shaping influences, popularised in the debates of the 1960s and 1970s when the world's states and economies seemed to be very clearly divided between those of the advanced 'West' and the newly independent but still 'underdeveloped' Third World.More recently, social change and economic advance in many of the world's postcolonial societies, particularly in east and southeast Asia, suggest now that we need new and more complex ways of understanding what have become in the later C20, global flows of capital and people, commodities and technologies. In these contexts, labels such as 'Third World', even the 'postcolonial' world, may no longer seem meaningful descriptions of what is a more complex and multicentred global society. Yet these very forces of 'globalisation', with the free play they create for unprecedented convergences of capital, technology and resources, seem to raise again issues of power and marginalisation, dominance and exploitation. As the legacies of older forms of imperialism and nationalism seem to recede into the historical past, categories such as the 'Third World' and the 'postcolonial' world may still therefore serve as important pointers to the inequalities of wealth and power that characterise the modern world.Paper 23 reading listPaper 23 course guideUseful online resourcesPast Papers:Prelim (Paper 19)Part I The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Foreign policy and diplomatic and military history are aspects of this and are likely to play quite a large part in periods when England was linked to an overseas territory, notably in France, or at lengthy war with one.The other central component of the papers is the constitutional framework within which politics took place. This is understood as the formal structures of power (the institutions of monarchy, government and law, both local and national, including parliament), the more informal ones (the inter-relationship of the king and his politically significant subjects - usually landowners - and the political aspects of the relationships between greater and lesser landowners) and contemporary beliefs concerning these.The 'British' dimension consists mainly of study of England's relations with other parts of the British Isles, but there is likely to be a small number of questions on the internal affairs of other British realms.Certain areas overlap with Paper 8 and are distinguished in this paper by a political and governmental emphasis. Thus 'feudalism' and 'bastard feudalism' are treated as aspects of the structures of power and governance and of local politics and, with regard to the Church, the emphasis is on its relationship with the state. These distinctions are made explicit in the reading lists for Papers 3 and 8.A study of key sources, is especially important in the early part of the paper and of key constitutional documents, such as Magna Carta and the Deposition Articles of Richard II, in the later part.Paper 3 course guidePaper 3 reading listGlossaryUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

They executed one king, deposed another, and built a republic; they fought a war in three kingdoms in the seventeenth century, three more against the Dutch republic, and finally two major European wars with the Dutch republic against Louis XIV's France.The 'medieval' polity transformed itself into the 'modern' state, although how, why, and when this transformation happened are controversial questions. The Tudors declared themselves supreme heads and governors of the English Church next under God on earth, and the Protestant Reformation they sponsored destroyed ancient forms of worship and reinforced the coercive power of the state. And yet religion also became a resource for challenging royal authority; the close relationship between confessional faith, royal dynasty, and the acceptable - and unacceptable - exercise of political power arguably set the scene for the wars of the 1640s and 1650s, the upheavals of the 1670s and 1680s, and underpinned the collapse of the Jacobite cause in the eighteenth century.Paper 4 encourages students to challenge some of the familiar and conventional chronological dates and themes of the period: the end of 'medieval' government in 1485, for example, or the 'inevitable' rise of the English parliament. Lectures and supervisions will bring you face to face with some of the major historiographical agreements and disagreements of the period, and enable you to think independently about the historical formation of the kingdoms of Britain and Ireland. Historical themes and forces necessarily complement the chronological shape of the paper.Tripos questions often cut across reigns or narrow periods of time; you may, for example, be asked to write on the issue of 'state formation', the development of political ideologies, or the governance of the kingdoms' localities. A series of core lectures in Michaelmas represent an important foundation for the study of the paper; each lecture explores a theme, institution, or idea central to the shape of early modern Britain. The core lectures are complemented by other lecture series.The course of lectures aims to present coherent and concise introduction to the period, closely related to the examination paper (remember that all lecturers contribute questions to this), and attentive to the chronological shape and thematic pattern of the three centuries between 1485 and 1714.

Diplomatic and imperial history are covered elsewhere in the Tripos (i.e. Papers 17, 18, and 21), but Britain’s European and world roles were also matters of intense debate in domestic politics. Moreover, they contributed to distinctive views about national identity (‘Englishness’) which are arguably crucial in understanding the appeal of some of the most charismatic political leaders and political traditions of the period.These two centuries also saw Britain establish itself as first the commercial market place, then the warehouse, and finally the workshop of the world, while throughout the period it acted as the world’s banker. These successive economic transformations impacted on politics as new commercial and then industrial elites arose to challenge the hegemony of the old aristocratic, monarchical, and clerical regimes.Economic developments also created the world’s first predominantly urban society, with attendant social problems (policing, housing, health, etc), all of which required political solutions and challenged traditional conceptions of the role of politics and the state. Such problems also generated – at least according to some historians – a growing sense of class consciousness and potential for social conflict, and present us with the difficulty of assessing how popular politics functioned and how political order was maintained.Finally, concern for the social order helps to explain why religious issues played an important part in politics throughout the period.Another salient theme arises from the political unions with Scotland (1707) and Ireland (1801), which not only created a United Kingdom state whose legitimacy was being called into serious question by 1886, when a government first introduced an Irish Home Rule Bill, but also precipitated debate on issues of British identity and nationality.   The Irish problem, in particular, presented British politicians with a set of fundamental challenges to their dominant assumptions about property, religion, local government, and empire.A final theme traces the way political life was immersed in wider intellectual and cultural contexts.  Broad developments in society created new opportunities for, and new media of, political communication and association. Political tactics and goals found expression in many literary and cultural forms. The aspirations of varying groups of men were reshaped as the habits of daily economic and social life evolved through commercialization, industrialization and urbanization. Likewise, women’s political capacities, disabilities, and ambitions fluctuated in relation to their changing circumstances. Notions of political capacity and citizenship were enriched by intellectual developments.   The role of religious ideas was often important in debates on these broader topics, while there was considerable controversy about the role that religious institutions should play in politics and the constitution.The Cambridge History Faculty has always been exceptionally strong in the history of ideas, and this has naturally affected the way in which political history is understood. Concepts relating to the constitution, the role of the state, and national identity play an important part in the paper, and emphasis is placed on underlying intellectual, cultural, religious, and linguistic developments.Candidates who have already studied this period at school should find this approach both novel and refreshing, while candidates who have not studied the period before may be reassured that they will not be at any disadvantage.In the essays you write on this paper you may well have to deal with relatively short periods, but you should always be prepared to relate your knowledge of such detailed events and processes to the wider themes of the paper. Paper 5 reading listPaper 5 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Conservative leaders continue to be dogged by the shadow of Margaret Thatcher, who herself had sought to free her party from its immediate, 'consensual', past. The Liberal Democrats ultimately found it necessary to keep the 'Liberal' label, despite the desire of the original pioneers of the SDP to 'break the mould' of British politics. Add to this the polemical power in recent years of 'Victorian values', 'appeasement', 'the Dunkirk spirit', 'the welfare state' and 'the winter of discontent', and the ongoing centrality of modern British history to political debate is clear. To study this period is therefore a licence for judicious iconoclasm. It involves a sceptical re-appraisal of many cherished assumptions about Britain's recent past, and in the process grounds for endless debate. The results may be surprising, even at times disconcerting, but is unlikely ever to be dull. Between 1880 and the end of the twentieth century, Britain experienced two world wars, the loss of its Empire and the exponential increase of its parliamentary electorate. All had profound political consequences, although these have not always been immediately obvious. The party system and much of the constitution remains in place, parliamentary democracy has survived the challenges of Fascism and Communism unscathed, and politicians have spent much of the previous hundred years congratulating their audience on the country's remarkable capacity to 'return to normal' in the aftermath of major crises.Many contemporary political controversies, such as devolution, Britain's relationship with Europe and the future of the House of Lords, have obvious parallels with late Victorian debates. Yet while continuity undoubtedly forms an important element of modern British political history, it would be wrong to obscure the fundamental changes that have occurred. Religion no longer assumes a central importance in determining political allegiance (with the partial exception of Northern Ireland), politicians now communicate with their audiences primarily through the filter of television and women outnumber men among the electorate.This paper provides a unique opportunity to contextualise this complex narrative of continuity and change, while affording students access to many of the new types of source material (primarily oral and audio-visual) that make the study of the twentieth century so distinctive.Paper 6 reading list and course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It also assesses developments in agriculture, estate-management, trade and towns; the religious and intellectual achievements of the tenth-century monastic reform; clerical and lay literacy and the use of the written word, and finally, Domesday Book and the impact of the Norman Conquest upon the peoples, churches, economies and cultures of Britain.The paper offers the opportunity to look closely (sometimes at first hand) at written sources (documentary and literary) and material evidence (e.g. metal work, coinage, pottery, manuscripts), by exploiting the exceptionally rich resources of the museums and libraries of Cambridge.For the period before c.1066, see the Anglo-Saxon England bibliography compiled by Professor S.D. Keynes. For the history of Celtic-speaking Britain and Ireland to c.1100, see the Supplementary booklist for Paper 7.For the period from 1050, see also the booklist for Paper 8. All of these are available from the Faculty General Office.The lectures for the paper comprise a course of eight core lectures and more detailed courses provided by members of the History Faculty and early medievalists from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic and the Department of Archaeology (archaeological evidence is particularly important for Paper 7).Note that the lectures listed in the course guide include a few courses whose primary coverage concerns Paper 2, but which be useful for students taking Paper 7 both for their inclusion of socio-economic or ecclesiastical themes, and for a general overview of the period (particularly useful for students not studying Papers 2 and 7 in combination): these lectures are marked with an asterisk.Paper 7 BibliographyPaper 7 Course GuideGlossary Useful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

Teaching is organized thematically, rather than chronologically: each lectures deals with change over time for its subject. The class each Friday follows the topic of the Thursday lecture and is run in a seminar style to engage more closely with the historical arguments and with the original source material that historians use to draw their conclusions. The classes allow students acquire analytical skills as well as to clarify and deepen their understanding of the lecture. Each class outline and the source materials used will be available on camtools, but no advance reading is required: time will be allowed in class to examine the sources. There are also two series of four lectures in the Michaelmas term which address issues for both Paper 9 and Paper 10: one on agricultural change and one on environmental change.   Paper 9 reading listPaper 9 course guideUseful online resourcesPast exam papers:PrelimsPart IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

This is the 'middle' paper of the three papers in the history of political thought but it should not on that account be overlooked. It is arguably the fulcrum on which an understanding of both the others depends.Like Paper 19, this paper offers two kinds of intellectual adventure. In Part A, you will focus on a close reading of major texts within their political and intellectual contexts. This allows you to explore how theoretical argument and analysis about politics emerges within a given historical period and so to develop philosophical skills within the Historical Tripos (or within the Politics Tripos for those borrowing this paper).In Part B, you will focus on particular debates and groups of texts which are thematically and historically connected, developing your ability to understand the way that a given political language is inflected in different ways according to different demands of circumstance and inclinations of intellectual temperament. For those considering doing other papers in the history of political thought or who have done them, this paper will provide a crucial basis to enrich and deepen your understanding of the foundations of modern politics.Because the material to be covered is diverse and especially challenging for many students who will not have studied the history of political thought before, more lectures are offered for this paper than for some others. You are not required or expected to attend them all since you will cover in supervision only seven or eight of the 30 named topics, and need answers only on three questions in the examination. In the examination paper one question will be set on every named A and B topic. You will therefore have the opportunity in conjunction with your supervisor to chart your own intellectual pathway through this paper.The course guide is to be read in conjunction with the Reading List, which is the invaluable guide and resource which lists all of the topics with specified primary reading and recommended secondary reading. The Reading List and will help you select those lectures which will be most relevant to your chosen topics, as well as those which are closely related. Note that a few lectures from other Faculties may be included in this list because the expertise in the history of political thought in Cambridge is shared among several Faculties.The lecturers will Paper 20 reading listPaper 20 course guideUseful online resourcesPast papers: Part IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

He or she is a History undergraduate's most important contact, and will assign to each of them a specialist supervisor for each paper. In nearly all cases, undergraduates have supervisions for one paper in each term, and so change supervisors each term. Supervisions offer teaching that is very flexibly suited to individual needs and closely monitored by the college.While most supervisions take place weekly, usually on a one-to-one or one-to-two basis, some members of the Faculty combine weekly small group classes for which students prepare reading, with weekly shorter individual supervisions focusing on each student's essay. Patterns of this kind vary: some supervisors offer a 90 minute class followed by 20 minute individual supervisions, while others offer one-hour classes followed by 30 minute individual supervisions (other variations are also possible).Supervisors for Part IThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

These involve a different style of study from the weekly essay. Teaching takes place in classes at regular intervals in the last two terms of the first year. Presentations by option teachers are held in the first teaching week of Michaelmas term, after which first year undergraduates are asked to choose their option.Options typically take a broad theme in comparative history (such as gender, race, Christianity or film) and investigate continuities and changes over time. Several options are based on a close reading of primary source material, and examine the problems involved in using such sources.Other options explore big themes over long periods of time; or there may be a combination of theme-based and source-based approaches. Some options may also involve the use of visual material. Those who have followed source-based courses at school will find these approaches quite familiar.Themes and Sources is a compulsory paper in Part I (Paper 1), and is assessed by means of a Long Essay (3000-5000 words) on one of a variety of set questions. This involves extensive individual research. It is set in May of the first year and submitted in January of the second year, so most of the work for it is done in the intervening vacations. Long essay questions will be available here on Thursday 24 May 2018 Information relating to Themes and Sources options taught 2016-2018 can be found here (Cambridge University only)  Themes and Sources Long Essay GuidanceFaculty Style GuideGuidance on plagiarismThemes and Sources Past Papers Long Essay cover sheets and declaration form (available Easter Term) © 2017 University of Cambridge

The paradox of the body is to be both timeless—the universal constant which is common to every body throughout history—and profoundly historicised. This course addresses the transformations in knowing, representing and possessing the body over a period beginning with the Renaissance reform of anatomy by Vesalius and his successors, and ending with the eugenic and Utopian projects of the early twentieth century. En route, it takes in the questions of bodily monstrosity as natural, political and scientific phenomenon; race, gender and class; social hygiene and physical culture. Past practices of normalising, regulating, training and quantifying the body are explored, as well as ways of inscribing and identifying it, from dress and photography to the creation of the labouring body.How should we approach the history of the body? Historians who have written about the body have drawn upon a wide range of related disciplines: anthropology, sociology, the history of science and medicine, art, gender studies, disability studies, queer theory and postmodernism. It is often those approaches which seem, on the face of it, to be the least concerned with the body as such which have generated the most fruitful and thought-provoking approaches to the body, and have allowed us to ‘get behind’ the apparently self-evident nature of the body as an historical object to reflections about symbolism, or about what underlies definitions of the ‘normal’, ‘healthy’, or ‘beautiful’ body. While bodies are material, they are also very much creations of a particular historical or geographical culture. Conventions for viewing, moulding and measuring the body vary greatly in time and place, as do the conventions governing gesture and dress. Power is frequently displayed via the body, and the conventions for doing so are likewise highly mutable. In the course we will explore some of these many roles that the body has possessed, and their significance. Should we speak of ‘the’ body or of bodies? What does it mean to have bodily standards and ideals to which individual bodies may aspire, or from which they differ? What are the boundaries between normality and abnormality, health and sickness, beauty and ugliness, power and weakness, and how have they been worked out in the past? And lastly, what is the relationship between the material reality of the body and its multiple symbolic roles?Course guide and reading list - currently in review© 2017 University of Cambridge

In Easter term, four sessions will be devoted to the close inspection of a specimen collection in each of four different types of institution in Cambridge. Students will be able to devote their long essays to the study of particular collections (not confined to those studied in class) or to themes linking collections. NB All classes in Lent term will be held in the Junior Parlour, Gonville and Caius College.  1.  Collecting:  History and Theory, 24 JanuaryStudents are asked to read Susan Pearce, On Collecting: An Investigation into Collecting in the European Tradition (1994) over the Christmas holiday.  2.  Collecting Art, 7 FebruaryD’Harcanville, ‘Preface’ in The Collection of Antiquities from the Cabinet of Sir WilliamHamilton  (1766), vol. 1, ii-xxiv, including dedication to George III.

The first segment of the course will consider the concept of religious conversion as it has been analysed by historians and anthropologists, as well as the political and intellectual context surrounding the emergence of the missionary projects. However, the bulk of the course will be made up of case studies which will show the diverse reception these missionary movements encountered. The use of specific cases from Africa, Spanish America, the Middle East, and Asia, will require students to get to grips with deep cultural variety and the question of conceptual translation, as well as the political logic of European expansion.Students will be asked to consider the role of the ruling classes in the process of religious conversion, and why Christianisation efforts were successful in some regions (as in Spanish America) while having only modest effects in other areas (such as Asia). And we shall consider the different role played by the state in driving religious conversion in areas such as the Americas and the Ottoman Empire. The course has a theoretical component, which should stimulate students to take a critical approach to the historiography and develop their own perspective on issues such as religious boundaries, the state, and cultural change through sustained comparison. Yet it will also be rooted in particular moments of encounter as illuminated by a diverse range of primary sources. These sources will include chronicles, travel diaries, correspondence, sermons, reports of ecclesiastical visits, music, and images. Class 1 : The Concept of Conversion in History and the Social SciencesDr Gabriela RamosThis class will discuss historical and anthropological approaches to religion and the concept of conversion.Hefner, Morris and Vilaça (available on Camtools) are compulsory reading for this class.Asad, Talal, Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power in Christianity and Islam, 1993, and ‘Comments on Conversion’ in Conversion to Modernities: The Globalization of Christianity, edited by Peter van der Veer, New York: Routledge. Bellah, Robert N.  ‘Religious Evolution’, American Sociological Review 29 (1964), 358-74.Berend, Nora (ed.)

Conversion in Southeast AsiaIntroduction: This class will explore the spread of Islam and Christianity to Southeast Asia during the early modern era. Religious diversity has often been seen as a defining characteristic of this region: both Islam and Christianity were brought to societies with Hindu-Buddhist as well as animist beliefs. Our examples will beAs both Islam and Christianity were introduced by foreign traders, it will be possible to take a comparative approach to early modern conversion. We will consider some of the political and economic motivations for rulers to convert, and how far Islam and Christianity penetrated into the various layers of social strata. We will also evaluate the extent to which the new religions changed social structures, promoting some groups and marginalising others, such as women in the Philippines. Here, it will also be possible to see how conversion strategies appropriated and accommodated indigenous religious beliefs, language and rituals. We will further examine how the sources examined here were used and understood in Europe, in particular how they fed arguments for increased colonial involvement in the region. Lastly, we will examine how the economic, social and political impact of conversion has been evaluated in the historiography of the region, with a special focus on the role of  religion in what has been called Southeast Asia’s ‘Age of Commerce’, a period of economic prosperity which lasted until the end of the seventeenth century.Questions for discussion:General introductory reading Sources Suggested further readingAndaya, Barbara Watson, ‘Religious developments in  Southeast Asia, c. 1500-1800’, in Nicholas Tarling (ed.), The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia, vol.  I (1999).Brown, C.

Race, religious conversion, and colonialismThis class will examine the question of race in religious conversion in colonial contexts, drawing from a range of sources from the medieval and early-modern periods. It will begin by examining the sorts of ideas about difference and racialised difference that Europeans, and specifically Iberians, had developed by the end of the Middle Ages, which formed a conceptual framework that shaped their perception of the peoples they would encounter in their colonial expansion. The class will consider the factors that led early-modern Europeans to make radically different valuations of non-Europeans, using Jesuit reports on the people of Japan, India, and West Africa as a case study. It will then focus on the Spanish conceptualisation of the indigenous population of the Americas, and its significance in Spain’s colonial project. Finally, it will explore how such ideas were integral to the creation of an additional category in colonial society, that of the ‘mestizo’, and through it the significance of ideas of racial difference for religious conversion and colonialism.Secondary reading: Braude, Benjamin. ‘The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods.’ The William and Mary Quarterly 54.1 (1997): 103-142. * Burns, Kathryn. ‘Unfixing Race.’ Rereading the Black Legend : The Discourses of Religious and Racial Difference in the Renaissance Empires.

Andean and Mexican CatholicismAlthough there is enough evidence suggesting that the Spanish missionaries were quite successful throughout the New World, there has been much debate over how sincere was conversion among the indigenous people. At the heart of the question are the themes of adaptation and interpretation. Through the study of examples of colonial song, myth, and painting, this class will approach missionary strategies of conversion and indigenous adaptation of Catholicism in the Andes and Mexico.PrimaryAnonymous.

Christian Conversion and Personal Sanctification in Colonial South Africa Many twentieth-century Africans committed themselves to a form of evangelical Christianity that taught conversion was only the first step of a life of faith. It was not enough merely to be baptized into the faith as a child, nor did one remain a life-long Christian through force of habit. Instead, many African Christians understood conversion to be a dynamic, ongoing act, necessitating the daily recommitment of the self to God, and in this way, resulting in a state of personal holiness also known as sanctification. An important example of this intentional commitment to a life-long journey towards personal holiness was the ‘Divine Healing’ movement in South Africa. Adherents eschewed medicine and doctors and instead proclaimed that bodily and spiritual health and sanctification should be sought in Christ the Healer. This class examines the origins of Divine Healing in the Anglophone world of the late nineteenth century, its circulation throughout imperial networks and its immense popularity in the Transvaal amongst Boers, Britons and Africans at the time of the South African War (1899-1902). The class will consider why recently colonized Boers and especially Africans were drawn to these Holiness techniques of self-improvement and self-purification. The class will examine how Africans’ cultivation of personal holiness through Divine Healing became a route to advance towards modernization, progress and Western-style civilization. Africans used conversion and its twin – sanctification – to lay claim to rights that colonial regimes were increasingly denying them amidst a period of hardening racial segregation.Primary SourcesSelected Extracts from Leaves of Healing (US-published Divine Healing periodical that circulated widely in the Transvaal, South Africa at the turn of the twentieth century) Selected Extracts from William Burton, When God Makes a Pastor: A Biography of Elias Letwaba (Victory Press, 1934) Selected Extracts from Gordon Lindsay, John G.

For example, many practitioners were committed to a form of Anglo-Saxon ethnic chauvinism known as ‘British Israelism’ – what was this? What were the more progressive and cosmopolitan racial ideologies that also undergirded divine healing? What was the supposed link between a healthy body and a healthy race?2) What did Divine Healing mean for Boer adherents in the Transvaal, South Africa? What did the backdrop of the South African War (1899-1902) which pitted Boer against Briton mean for the success of Divine Healing in this period? How did Divine Healing provide a platform to articulate a new white South African identity, in which Boer and Briton were reconciled?3) How did the emergence of this white South African identity simultaneously exclude black South Africans from full citizenship? In this context of increasing racial segregation, why was Divine Healing so successful? For example, for black South Africans what were the progressive implications of Divine Healing? How did these techniques of bodily perfection promise full citizenship and equality within the British Empire? How did miraculous healing come to imply African modernity and progressive self-advancement? What were the other (possibly competing) idioms of African uplift and progress circulating in the Transvaal in this period?4) Where did Africans understand Divine Healing to sit in relation to their own existing healing therapies? How did Divine Healing transform existing local perceptions of health and sickness? How did its practices build upon and reprise indigenous healing repertoires? Class 8. Literacy and Conversion in AfricaThis class will examine the attitudes of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Protestantmissionaries in Africa to the translation of religious texts, and the challenges they faced in translating key religious concepts into indigenous languages. What role did indigenous translators play in the translation process, and how does examining their role change our viewof the relationship between conversion and colonialism? But literacy acquired in the context of conversion did not only offer the potential for a new relationship with the sacred, it also provided a new means with which to engage in the colonial world. This class will alsotherefore consider how converts used their literacy both to work with colonialism, as clerks or elected chiefs, and to critique aspects of colonial rule.Primary Sources, Secondary Sources and QuestionsPrimary Sources:Salomo Nkya: ‘The story of my childhood’, in Klaus-Peter Kiesel, Kindheit und Bekehrung in Nord-Tanzania, University of Leipzig Papers on Africa, History and Culture Series No. 12 (2005), p. 128Extracts from British and Foreign Bible Society Archives: BFBS/BSA/E3/3/78 ChagaExtract from Mtui, Nine Notebooks of Chagga HistoryExtracts from: ‘The first year of the Chagga Mission’, Church Missionary Intelligencer, 1886Extract from W.J.W.

The memory of the Nazi past has left a deep imprint on political culture in the two German states after 1945, and continues to inform politics, society and culture in reunified Germany. Tracing these debates thus provides a unique perspective on German identity and history after the war. Our course thus aims to analyze the often complex interrelationship between memory, politics and society. From the denazification policies of the Allies in the 1940s to the debates on the construction of a Holocaust memorial in the German capital in the 1990s this Themes and Sources option analyzes various attempts to come to terms with (or curb engagement with) the recent past. Such attempts were always part of a complex inner-German dynamic, as neither German state's attempt to come to terms with the past can be understood without the respective other. Core examples will be drawn from West German as well as East German material, in order to get a comprehensive picture and compare the development in East and West Germany.The Course Convener, Dr. Henning Grunwald, is DAAD Lecturer in Modern European History. He will be joined by Dr Helen Roche, an expert in the history of education in Nazi and postwar Germany in transnational perspective. Another focus will be on judicial efforts to deal with the NS past, from the Nuremberg trials to the recent proceedings against Oskar Groening, the ‘accountant of Auschwitz’.The course will be based on multimedia sources: Primary sources (documents, movies, visual material such as propaganda posters) will be in German, secondary reading in English. A prior knowledge of German is required for this course (AS or A level). An accompanying language course for this option will be offered by the language centre in the Lent and Easter term. Students with AS level will be offered a preparatory course in the Michaelmas Term before they join students with A level for the language course in the week prior to the Lent Term.

Fortunately there is nothing difficult or esoteric about the study of money in society, and there is no need to become an economic historian to do it.This option covers the period from the establishment of Barbarian kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire to the beginnings of the modern financial system, but a detailed knowledge of medieval or early modern history is not required. The course is concerned with money in its widest sense, including coinage, credit, commerce and banking.This course provides a rare opportunity for history students to engage with material culture, such as coins, as well as with more conventional primary and secondary sources. The classes are held at the Fitzwilliam Museum, which has one of the greatest collections of coins in the world, and there will be opportunities to see many coins and historical artefacts at first hand.Course website  [Access restricted to registered course participants only]Fitzwilliam Museum Department of Coins and Medals website Introductory reading:The Classes are as follows: LENT TERM 1. Introduction to Money and SocietyThe use of money is so universal in the modern world that it is easy to take it for granted, without much thought about how it works or where it came from. The growth of electronic means of payment and the decline of the use of cash in recent years has shown, however, that there is nothing immutable about the forms that money can take, and the recent global financial crisis has shown what can happen when money malfunctions.Until the invention of coinage in the seventh century BC, and in many parts of the world until recently, commodities of various kinds performed some of the functions of money as we now understand them. Commodities could be used as a means of exchange, to obtain other goods, and as a standard of value (for example, something could be worth a specified number of cattle). Some commodities (such as precious metal objects) could be used as a store of value, if they could be kept for long periods without deterioration or loss of value. Coins fulfilled all of these functions more conveniently than any form of commodity money, and their use was fundamental to the development of trade and state formation in the ancient and medieval worlds. The use of money took a further major leap forward with the spread of paper money and banking in the early modern period, laying the foundations for the financial system familiar to us today. 2. Coinage and currency in early medieval EuropeThis class focuses on the early Middle Ages (fifth to eleventh centuries), a period when the written sources relating to money and its use are sparse and can only be fully understood  with the support of the evidence of the surviving coinage and the archaeological record. While structuring our discussion around sources, we will be looking for answers to a range of general questions about money, such as: Where, when and by whom were coins struck? What was the purpose of coinage, and what incentives did the authorities have to issue it and the people have to use it? How much regulation was there over the production and distribution of coinage, and the subsequent use of it? Were old coins or foreign coins banned? Were there fluctuations in the amount of coinage in circulation, and what effect did this have on the way people carried out their transactions and on the economy generally? 3. Money, economy and Ideology in the Byzantine EmpireThis class will examine the connections between money, economy and ideology in the Byzantine Empire, focusing in particular on Byzantium’s seventh-century crisis, when the empire suffered major territorial contraction, caused by the Arab conquests, and large scale de-urbanisation. The extent to which a monetary economy survived this period of crisis will be examined through consideration of both numismatic and written sources. The iconography of the Byzantine coinage provides evidence of the religious and political ideology of the empire, but the class will show that it also became a focus of conflict with the rising power of Islam. 4. Merchants and money in Italy during the Commercial Revolution of the Middle AgesFrom the twelfth century onwards Italy experienced a period of radical innovation in trade and commerce that transformed the ways in which money was used. In the ‘Commercial Revolution’ the great merchant-banking companies of northern and central Italy established far-ranging networks, with headquarters in the home city and permanent branch offices in foreign cities, giving rise to the rapid expansion of long-distance international trade. Money could be transmitted across Europe by sending documents only and not coins, for the first time, and the Italians devised new ways to raise large sums of money to finance trade and government. At the same time, there were also major innovations in local banking. EASTER TERM 5. Money in medieval England I: The use of money in urban and rural society, c. 1086-1500In this class we shall investigate three themes. The first theme is the crucial role of money in the development of England’s urban economy, from the time of Domesday Book to the late medieval period. The second theme is the increasing use of money in the countryside. We will consider the role of commercialisation in the changes to be observed in the organization of life on the English rural manor. In Domesday Book the land yields a complex mixture of money rents, commodities and labour services. By the time of the Black Death rural life is increasingly dominated by the sale of produce and wage labour, to pay rents, manorial obligations converted to cash, and taxes. The third and final theme is the role of government. The sources show English medieval governments regulating the quality of the coinage, severely punishing mint officials blamed for making bad coins and taking measures against the import of foreign money. We will consider what effect these actions may have had upon the economy, and what they reveal about prevailing attitudes to money. 6. Money in medieval England II: Credit, debt and usuryIn medieval England the supply of coin was never sufficient to allow everyone to make all their payments immediately and in full. Also, in the middle ages as today, most merchants and households suffered from cash flow problems. These factors meant that almost everyone needed to borrow from time to time. Indeed, the economy depended on structures of credit. There were a number of different types of credit transaction, and this session explores the key types using primary sources. The sources reveal the activities of borrowers from different social groups, including rural landowners, townspeople, foreign and native merchants, and peasants. We also investigate the lenders in these credit transactions in town and countryside, devoting special attention to the Jews who acted as important creditors between the Norman conquest of 1066 and their expulsion from England in 1290. Lending and borrowing did not sit easily with medieval morality, however. In fact, lending at interest, or usury, was banned by the medieval church. The session also considers the reasons for the usury ban and its impact on commercial realities.One particularly important theme of this session concerns the relationship between the volume of credit and the supply of money. Through discussions of the period c.1100-c.1500, we will engage with the debate about whether the use of credit was ever able to make up for shortages of coin. We will also debate the pros and cons of heavy borrowing for economy and society, issues which remain as valid today as they were in the medieval period. 7. Early modern coins and creditThis class examines the strains put on the circulating gold and silver currency in the seventeenth century by an expanding market economy. We will explore currency shortages and the intractable problems associated with the coinage that was available, as well as the use of tokens in response to the need for small change. We will also consider the increasing use of credit and the question of trust in a society dependent upon credit. 8. The currency crisis of the 1690s and the Financial RevolutionIn this class we will examine the currency crisis of the mid 1690s, which resulted in the Great Recoinage of 1696, and the creation of the Bank of England, brought about by the cost of the war with France. The foundation of the Bank of England was crucial moment in the development of the modern financial system. We will also look at the some of the contending literature on banks published in the period, as well as ideas about state credit. © 2017 University of Cambridge

We will grapple with the multiple ideological constructions of race and class, as well as notions of ‘culture’, and examine how these changed over time. Offering an introduction to the history of Southern Africa as well as to the global history of colonialism and comparative history more broadly, the course draws upon recent historiography that emphasises patterns of interconnectedness between countries in the region. Our particular interest is to explore and explain specific notions of race and class, as well as the complex ways they shaped state and society in southern Africa from colonial conquest through to the history of Apartheid and struggles for self-determination and freedom.* Southern Africa is defined as comprising the following countries: South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Namibia and Angola. Class 1: Race and ‘civilisation’: The Eastern Cape frontier and the Xhosa cattle killing (Dr Watson)The course begins in nineteenth-century South Africa. After the British seized administrative control of the Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1806, colonial conquest of the region was far from complete. Contestation was especially fierce on the eastern frontier where the British army engaged in a series of bitter wars against the Xhosa peoples. In 1855, an epidemic of lungsickness killed two-thirds of their cattle. Subsequently, a prophecy from a young girl, Nongqawuse, that the Xhosa should slaughter all their cattle and destroy all their grain so that the world could be renewed, gained particular potency. The result was that the political, cultural and economic integrity of the Xhosa, long penetrated and undermined by colonial pressure, finally collapsed.This class will examine some of the racial discourses that emerged from these events and how they intersected with British notions of ‘civilisation’. Using the memoirs of British soldiers, published colonial records, and the biography of Governor George Grey, we will address questions such as: what were the cultural ingredients of Grey’s ‘civilisation policy’? How were racist ideas of ‘barbarous natives’ used to justify imperial subjugation? What role did ideas about wage labour play? Class 2: Class, culture and labour on South Africa’s diamond mines and goldfields (Prof Dubow)South Africa was transformed by the discovery of diamonds and gold in the late-nineteenth century. African workers migrated to the mines for short-term employment from across the region, including present-day Mozambique and Lesotho. The mineowners took action to exert coercive control over their labour force and housed their workers in closed barracks, known as compounds, which they were only permitted to leave to go to work. In this way, workers were controlled and labour discipline and lower wages were ensured.This class seeks to explore ‘the world the mineowners made’ in late nineteenth-century South Africa, through examining how conceptions of race, class and culture influenced the making of the labour force. We will address questions such as: Why were African men, rather than women, the first to migrate? How did coercive controls such as the closed compound and pass laws develop? By what means was the racial bifurcation of the industrial labour forces achieved? What were the short- and long-term consequences of the mineral discoveries for African societies? Class 3: Race and imperialism in southwest Africa: The Herero genocide (Prof Dubow)German colonisation of southwest Africa (today Namibia) began in the late nineteenth century. Facing the loss of over a quarter of their lands, the Herero and Nama peoples launched an uprising in 1903, in which about a hundred colonists were killed. A large German army led by Lieutenant-General von Trotha brutally defeated the Herero/Nama combatants the following year. Subsequently, von Trotha gave orders that all captured Herero and Nama men should be executed, while women and children were to be driven into the desert. From 1905, remaining survivors were put in concentration camps, where they were forced to work as slave labour, and were also used for medical experiments.Today, these events are classified as one of the earliest cases of genocide in the twentieth century. Building on discussions in the first class, in this topic we examine the construction of racial discourses about ‘native peoples’ as well as ideas of benevolent imperialism. Questions to be explored include: how far was the German conquest of southwest Africa conceived in racial terms? What influence did the broader imperial context have on German colonial practices?  How did colonial authorities explain and understand ‘native resistance’? Class 4: Contesting cultures of race, sex and class in African settler societies (Dr Watson)Control over the mobility and sexuality of African men and women were key issues in early colonial settler society. Debating these issues involved the defence of white settler economic and social interests, as well as ideological constructions of race and gender. Focusing on the settler colonies of Southern and Northern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe and Zambia) and South Africa in the early twentieth century, this class will examine issues of sexuality and domesticity, and the construction of a moral order. How did the perceived sexual unruliness of African men threaten key material interests in settler colonies? Why was policy-making around issues of sexuality important to the processes of early colonial state formation? How was the ideal of white racial supremacy undermined by the reality of white poverty? Combining analysis of novels and documentary sources (such as the Southern Rhodesian Native Affairs Department annuals and the Carnegie Commission report on white poverty in South Africa), this class will examine these questions and the construction of a moral discourse in white settler societies in southern Africa. Class 5: African migration and urbanisation in southern Africa (Dr Watson)  The remarkable expansion of towns on the Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt from the 1920s became a benchmark for African urbanisation during colonial rule. African urban administration presented a particular dilemma to British colonial rulers. Africans had been understood as ‘tribal’ residents living under chiefly control in rural areas. Growing demand for labour meant that increasing numbers of African men and women were spending longer periods in urban environments. This class will examine the processes of migration and urbanisation in the British colonies of southern Africa, paying particular attention to cultural and class identities, using colonial government reports, oral histories and contemporary ethnographic studies. Historical understandings of ethnicity and tribe, culture and custom will also be explored. Anthropologists associated with the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in Northern Rhodesia produced a series of pioneering studies on African urban life, from the mid-1930s to the 1960s. Their work covered issues from labour disputes and labour organisation, to the new habits, tastes and aspirations of urban men and women, as well as the emergence of new cultural phenomena, such as urban dance and burial societies. Although the Rhodes-Livingstone scholars were criticised for idealising ethnic groups, their studies were superbly observed and recorded, making for compelling source material. Class 6: Pass laws, group areas, and popular protest: Apartheid in urban South Africa (Dr Watson)The National Party won the 1948 election in South Africa on a platform of ‘apartheid’, meaning ‘apartness’. Apartheid developed earlier policies of segregation, but it was implemented on a much larger scale, and was supported by unprecedented levels of state repression. Numerous laws were passed during the 1950s, with the aim of enforcing a racially separate and unequal social order.This class examines two specific types of legislation: pass laws and the Group Areas Act. Pass laws had long been used to restrict the movement of black South Africans, but during the 1950s it became illegal for African men (and eventually, African women) to be in urban areas without a pass. These laws worked in tandem with the 1950 Group Areas Act, which enforced racial segregation in urban centres and also restricted the ownership and occupation of land to specific racial groups. To explore these developments, we will address questions such as: how far did popular protest undermine and effectively challenge apartheid laws? How should we judge the relative importance of race and class identities in understanding politics and society in South Africa during the 1950s? To what extent were South Africa’s African urban cultures destroyed by apartheid? Class 7: A luta continua (‘the struggle continues’): Liberation struggles in southern Africa (Dr Watson)By the late 1960s, the only non-independent African countries were those in settler-dominated southern Africa. Over the following decade, liberation struggles in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Angola escalated with armed conflict that spilled over the borders and impacted the entire region. Recently, new research has highlighted the interconnectedness and international dimensions of these liberation struggles, exploring the significance of the Cold War, the involvement of various former colonial powers, and their interaction with local political conflicts.This class presents a region-wide exploration of liberation movements in southern Africa from the 1960s until Zimbabwean independence, focusing on Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa. We will examine the experiences of exile, and the role of international agencies in these movements, as well as the significance of local tensions in shaping liberation struggles on the ground. Key questions include: to what extent did liberation movements in southern Africa articulate a shared class and race consciousness? How did cultures of exile politics influence ideologies of liberation? How, and why, did peasants play such a crucial role? Class 8: Long walk to freedom: Reflecting on the life of Nelson Mandela (Prof Dubow)This class focuses on how personal stories can add to our understanding of historical events by critically reading Nelson Mandela’s autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. We will follow his development from ‘country boy’, to urban black South African, to ANC activist and political leader, to political prisoner, president and world icon. The extent of reverence accorded Mandela was particularly apparent at his death in December 2013, when the world engaged in an unprecedented exercise of collective mourning.By analysing Mandela’s subjective experience in the context of broader collective experiences in his lifetime, this concluding class draws together some of the key themes of this course. These include the impact of colonial conquest on rural life, politics and society in early twentieth-century South Africa, industrialisation and African urbanisation, the impact of apartheid on black South Africans and their resistance to it, and the growth of black militancy. Key questions include: In what ways was Mandela’s childhood ‘different’ from that of other black children in interwar South Africa? To what extent did Mandela and the ANC use their criminal trials as platforms for their political beliefs? How should we account for Mandela’s achievement of iconic status after his release from prison? Reading List© 2017 University of Cambridge

Film is not a substitute for conventional historical documents but it is an extremely valuable addition.  Though more difficult at first to perceive, the benefits of studying the fiction film can be ultimately more rewarding for the historian than the more obvious information to be derived from contemporary newsreels and documentaries.  Fiction films rarely set out to document the events of their times but because they are designed to appeal to the widest possible section of the public, inevitably, even if unwittingly, fiction films tell future generations a great deal about the mores and customs of the time in which they are produced.D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation, a hugely successful and original telling of the story of the Civil War and Reconstruction, was released in February 1915 when the war in Europe was only six months old and still retained some novelty value.  It made the fortunes of Griffith, its producer and director and the film’s various distributors.  In 1917 Griffith made Intolerance, an equally original cinematic blockbuster but a commercial disaster because the film’s message of the horrors of war were not what the public wanted to hear in the year that the USA joined the war in Europe. Sometimes, a film’s failure can be just as useful to a historian as a film’s success.  A bad film can sometimes tell the historian more than a good film. This course is about Film and History, not film aesthetics. The popular feature films of the 1930s and 1940s drew vast audiences across the world, and as such can tell us as much about the hopes and fears of ordinary people as learned treatises by contemporaries claiming to speak on their behalf. Frank Capra’s films feature prominently in the classes on American history because they chimed so perfectly with the zeitgeist. Mainstream movies are designed to appeal to the largest audience possible so their commercial fate tells us how successfully they have captured the mood of the moment.  Capra’s Mr Deeds Goes to Town tells us things about America in 1936 that we can't get simply from a study of New Deal legislation.  If students want to know what America was really thinking during those fateful months between Hitler's invasion of Poland and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor they should watch the 1940 adaptation of The Sea Hawk directed by Michael Curtiz in which direct parallels are clearly drawn between Elizabeth I and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, between England’s fight against Spain in 1588 and the Battle of Britain and between the Queen’s instinctive desire for peace and the flawed arguments of the Americans who believed in isolationism. They should also watch The Great Dictator and Sergeant York and A Yank in the RAF and Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent. Certainly, they are "only" movies but it is a wise historian who opens his or her eyes and mind to the possibilities offered by the study of the fiction film.  Introductory Class 1 ~ Film history and Film as Historical Source 1895 - 1929 ~ Colin ShindlerMain film:  The Birth of a Nation (1915) The course is designed to teach undergraduates how to evaluate film as an historical source. It will therefore facilitate their understanding if they learn how the film industry started. The major technological innovations in the first years of the twentieth century took place in France, Russia, Great Britain, Italy and the United States. Films were rapidly exchanged between countries and new techniques instantly copied. Hollywood’s early establishment of its primacy in world markets was the result of the participation of the other developing film industries in the First World War. The effectiveness of wartime propaganda, however crude, was slow to develop but the astonishing impact of The Birth of a Nation confirmed its value.  Film was being taken seriously even in government circles as the crude propaganda films of 1914-1918 showed. The beginnings of vertical integration in the studio system in Hollywood shortly after the end of the war and the large capital investment it attracted maintained America’s domination abroad but each European country tried hard to institute its own native industry, making films about its own culture that Hollywood would never imitate. Other clips will include Civilisation, Battleship Potemkin, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, The Big Parade, Metropolis, Sunrise, The Jazz Singer, Blackmail and the British government produced and financed documentary feature The Battle of the Somme. Required Class Reading:Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (ed.) The Oxford History of World Cinema (1996) Roberta Pearson, Transitional Cinema pp23-42Suggested ReadingAnthony Aldgate,  Cinema & History chapter 1  (1979)Tino Balio (ed)  The American Film Industry (revised edition) (1985)Gerben Bakker, Entertainment Industrialised: The Emergence of the International Film Industry 1890-1940 (2008)Kevin Brownlow, Behind the Mask of Innocence (1990)Kevin Brownlow, Hollywood :The Pioneers (1979)Gorham Kindem (ed) The International Movie Industry (2000)Richard Koszarski, An Evening’s Entertainment: The age of the silent feature picture 1915-1928 (1994)Geoffrey Nowell-Smith (ed.) The Oxford History of World Cinema (1996)Eric Rhode:  A History of World Cinema (1976)K.R.M.

Films likeI Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and Five Star Final paint a portrait of a corrupt and venal America and they were made in the major studios, which for the first time in their short dramatic existence with the exception of MGM, lost money heavily. It is hardly surprising then that Hollywood embraced the New Deal eagerly, welcoming the revival in national self-confidence and the consequent economic recovery because it was good for its own business. In films like Black Fury and Massacre they showed how the government planned to deal with miners’ conditions and the fate of ethnic minorities. Even musicals like Swing Time starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and comedies like It Happened One Night are rooted in the Depression but all come with the mandatory happy ending. Ninety million Americans went to the movies each week in this decade. Film had a dramatic impact in a country in which only radio could compete for the attention of the mass audience.  The dictators knew the power of film.  The democracies were no less influenced by it.  Other clips include The Public Enemy, Scarface, Duck Soup, Gold Diggers of 1933, Wild Boys of the Road, Heroes for Sale, Gabriel over the White House Required Class Reading:Thomas Schatz, The Genius of the System : Hollywood filmmaking in the studio era (1998) pp. 159- 271Suggested Reading:Michael E.

The battle between isolationists and interventionists had been intense and, because Hollywood was full of European refugees from fascism and political liberals, the interventionists held sway there to an extent that prompted an investigation by Congress during 1941. The unity in the country created by Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war was instant and Hollywood worked sympathetically with the government directives through the Bureau of Motion Pictures and the Office of War Information.  Movies, if it were possible, became even more important as the public lapped up the government propaganda that ranged from Warner Brothers’ dramatization of the pro-Soviet memoir of Ambassador Joseph E. Davies Mission to Moscow to Bing Crosby singing about the Four Freedoms in Holiday Inn. If Casablanca had been made before 7 December 1941 it is arguable that Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman would have gone off together but in a war the sacrifice made by the hero was important and of course that ending made the film memorable at the time and an enduring classic.   Nazis like Conrad Veidt’s Major Strasser made useful villains in many melodramas but the depiction of the Japanese in films like Destination Tokyo, Thirty Seconds over Tokyo and particularly The Purple Heart additionally showed an ugly racist edge which reflected the domestic treatment of the Japanese immigrants and their American-born children.  Other clips might include: Confessions of a Nazi Spy, The Sea Hawk, Sergeant York,, Guadalcanal Diary, Since You Went Away, Mrs Miniver and Sahara  Required Class Reading:Richard Raskin, Casablanca & US Foreign Policy in Film History vol.iv pp. 153-164Aljean Harmetz, Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca – Bogart, Bergman and World War II (1993)  pp.102-116, 240-252Suggested Reading:John Morton Blum, V was for victory: politics and American culture during World War II (1976)Thomas Doherty, Projections of War: Hollywood, American Culture and WWII (1993)Robert Fyne, Long Ago and Far Away Hollywood Propaganda and WWII (2008)John W.

The working class is notable mostly for either its invisibility or its portrayal as cheerful and spirited (Gracie Fields in Sing As We Go) or comic and incompetent  (George Formby in Off the Dole). The importance of America to the British film industry can be seen from the establishment by the major Hollywood studios of British outposts and the making of A Yank at Oxford and Goodbye Mr Chips as films with a British subject but with an MGM gloss.   Towards the end of the decade an awareness of events in Europe starts to become a significant theme in British films although Michael Powell’s The Spy in Black, like Curtiz’s The Sea Hawk dresses the modern story in a tale of times past, in his case the Great War. Hitchcock was quick to respond to the new mood in the country with the heroism of Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes (1938), set in some nameless central European country, contrasting markedly with Cecil Parker’s pacifist coward. Margaret Lockwood appears again that same year as the star of Carol Reed’s Bank Holiday, a fascinating look at all levels of British society on a bank holiday weekend.

The triumph of Noel Coward and David Lean’s In Which We Serve (1942) which showcased the indomitable spirit of the Royal Navy was matched by Carol Reed’s superb The Way Ahead (1944), showing how the new British army took men of all classes and trained them to become a fighting force. Way to the Stars (1945), starring Michael Redgrave and John Mills, was Anthony Asquith’s realization of Terence Rattigan’s moving discourse on bereavement and the sacrifice of the American and Royal Air forces. The strength of the British film industry at this time was that it tackled all sorts of problems – the role of women in Leslie Howard’s The Gentle Sex (1943), the factory workers in Launder & Gilliatt’s Millions Like Us (1943), the danger of fifth columnists in Cavalcanti’s Went The Day Well? (1943).   The portrayal of Britain in Hollywood films of the time such as The White Cliffs of Dover (1943) and Mrs Miniver (1942) will also be of interest.

One of his problems was that some of the best film-makers, notably Lang, Dieterle, Siodmak, Zinnemann and Billy Wilder, had fled Germany. Of the directors who stayed behind, Leni Riefenstahl was probably the most accomplished. Her innovative techniques raised film as propaganda to a new level.  We will consider Riefenstahl’s artistic masterpieces Triumph of the Will (1935) and Olympia (1938), but our main focus will be on the more conventional Nazi propaganda films.  Contrasting the success of the costume drama Jew Süss (1940) with the pseudo-documentary The Eternal Jew (1940) will allow us to reflect on how Nazi ideology was incorporated into – and worked more effectively through – apparent “entertainment” films. That is why the main film that students are required to see before this session is Titanic (1943), the story of the disaster being utilised specifically to condemn the heartlessness of the British and to elevate the sole hero – a German whose warnings of impending doom were ignored. On a wider level it is instructive to see how different are the various film depictions of the 1912 disaster from this piece of anti-British wartime propaganda to the stiff upper lip hero played by Kenneth Moore in A Night to Remember (1958) to the last blockbuster version starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett and directed by James Cameron in 1998.  Once again the fiction film tells us much more about the year in which the film is made than 1912, the year in which it is set. Required Class Reading:D.

With the death of Jean Vigo and the exile of Rene Clair, Renoir was by the end of the decade the best director in France, producing on the eve of war his masterpiece La Regle du Jeu, a memorable portrait of a leisured class whose days were numbered.  Renoir began work on it immediately after the Munich agreement intending to portray a society that was “gnawed by a malady and dancing on a volcano”. Required Class Reading:Keith Reader, La Regle du Jeu (2010)Suggested Reading:Phil Powrie and Keith Reader, French cinema: a student's guide (2002)Martin O’Shaughnessy, Jean Renoir (2000)Colin Davis, Postwar Renoir: Film & the Memory of Violence (2012)Dudley Andrew, Mists of Regret: Culture and sensibility in classic French film (1995)Jill Forbes, Enfants du Paradis (1997)Julian Jackson, La Grande Illusion (BFI Film Classics, 2009)Andrew Dudley and Steven Ungar, Popular Front Paris and the Poetics of Culture (2005).  Class 8 ~ Italian film and Fascism  ~ Colin Shindler and Eugenio BiaginiMain Film: Roma Citta Apertà (1945)Italian films made during the fascist period were usually not "fascist" in tone, although they were often nationalistic and patriotic, much like their Hollywood counterparts. Mussolini, like Hitler and Stalin, recognized the vital importance of film in shaping the opinions of the masses and Italian cinema in the 1930s and there were, predictably, a number of productions with heroic nationalist themes.   Political opposition to the fascists was fashionable at film schools but the search for realism in the Italian cinema began not with those men who became the neo-realists of the postwar period but, rather, with directors working in the 1930s and the 1940s before the end of World War II. In an important manifesto published in 1933 a pro-Mussolini journalist called for Italian directors to take their cameras into the streets and to produce a non-Hollywood version of Italian everyday life. However, since Italian films were not exported abroad few Italian films of the interwar years have survived to be examined for such innovation. An exception is Luchino Visconti’s first film Ossessione, an adaptation of James M. Cain’s thriller The Postman Always Rings Twice, in which the influence of Renoir is unmistakably present. He had worked as 3rd assistant director on Renoir’s Une Partie de Campagne (1936) and it was the French director who sent Visconti a translation of the Cain book. The battles with the fascist censors were unending but eventually the film was made and contains some astonishingly frank depictions of adultery. Rossellini’s Roma Citta Apertà, co-written with Fellini, was made as German snipers remained in the streets of Rome after the invading Allied armies had liberated the city. The documentary, neo-realist nature of the film made it instantly famous and set the tone for the postwar decade of films by de Sica, Fellini, Visconti and Rossellini which are commonly regarded as a high watermark in Italian cinema, and as benchmarks for a new direction in world cinema.  Required Class Reading:David Forgacs, Rome Open City (BFI, 2000)Suggested Reading:Peter Bondanella, A History of Italian Cinema (2010)Angela Dalle Vacche, The Body in the Mirror: Shapes of History in Italian Cinema (1992)Paul Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy, 1943-1980 (1990) chs 1-3 [google]Stuart Woolf, The Rebirth of Italy, 1943-1950 (1972)David Forgacs, Italian Culture in the Industrial Era 1880-1980: Cultural Industries, Politics and the Public (1990)J.

Discovering how the words ‘work’ and ‘labour’ were used historically helps to   understand how these words are used in so many different contexts today. (Think of housework, in work, and needlework, or labourer and   being in labour.). Examining what kinds of work people did allows us to glimpse how different their daily lives were from our own, and also to assess processes of economic development in the long run. Covering five and a half centuries, between the poll tax of 1377 and the national census of 1911, we start with the endpoint because the early 20th century evidence is the most accessible to begin to understand the issues. Population lists like the poll tax and the census recorded occupations, which can be classified to determine the proportion of the population that worked in agriculture, in manufacturing, and in services. These three sectors are indicators of development for economists. But these sources more reliably recorded men’s occupations than they did women’s work. So we add other sources like account books to find out what work people were paid for. Formulaic sources like these which facilitate quantitative analysis are systematically contrasted with narrative sources providing qualitative discussions of work, including diaries, autobiographies, poetry and fiction. Throughout, close attention is paid to geography: from where in the country does the diarist or the quantitative source originate? Different types of landscape allow different types of economy which enables or limits ways of earning a living.Students taking this option will be using numerical material, but no knowledge of maths beyond basic numeracy is required. Training will be provided in the use of two software packages (MS Excel and MS Access) in the week before the option begins. Each chronological class is organised around this series of questions:(1)   What can the sources tell us about what ‘work’ meant?(2)   What proportion of men and women worked in agriculture, in manufacturing, and in services?(3)   Where were the most important clusters of nationally important economic activities?(4)   What regional differences were there?(5)   How specialised were individual occupations?(6)   What can we learn from these sources about how work varied across the life cycle?(7)   How did male and female patterns differ?(8)   How different are the above patterns from those we encountered in the previous class?(9)   What are strengths and limitations of the quantitative and qualitative evidence?(10)      What would like to know that the sources do not tell us?The classes are outlined below, along with their source material. Secondary reading lists and fuller class descriptions will be available on camtools for those taking this option. CLASS 0         Introduction to spreadsheets and databasesThe introductory session will teach students the basics of spreadsheet use with MS Excel and database use with MS Access, skills which they will use through the rest of the classes. Excel and Access are very widely used analytical packages with an unlimited range of applications outside of historical ones. CLASS 1         1851-1911: LABOURING LIVESThis class examines descriptive life histories of earning a living around the turn of the last century, in contrast to the quantitative census material. These are presented in types of narrative that we have seen before, like autobiography and investigators’ reports, and also in the form of reported speech, which echoes the seventeenth-century court records that we used in Class 2.Kitchen, F., Brother to the ox (1939)Sturt, G., Memoirs of a Surrey labourer (1907, reprinted 1978)Abram, A., ‘Newcastle’, in C.

As of 2014, they are available in digital form. We will examine the ways that occupations have been classified, and in census material aggregated, over time, and the ways in which historians have used census data, focussing on the 1851, 1881 and 1911 censuses1911 Census of England and Wales, National and County Occupational Data, Males and Females1881 Census of England and Wales, Parish Occupational Data, Males and Females1851 Census of England and Wales, Parish Occupational Data, Males and Females CLASS 3         c1377-c1522: TAXATION RECORDS & DESCRIPTIONS OF WORKThe main aim of this session is to establish what occupations were carried out by ordinary men and women in the countryside and small towns in the late medieval period. A further specific aim is to determine how far the range and importance of occupations changed between the later fourteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Was the period c.1377-c.1520 one of structural change in the economy which gave rise to new occupations, including new occupations for women? We compare sources which permit quantification with qualitative sources. Two of the four primary sources for this class are taxation records, so we will investigate especially closely the strengths and weaknesses of this category of material. We also ask whether the communities documented in our selected sources are typical of the country as a whole.C.C. Fenwick, ed., The poll taxes of 1377, 1379 and 1381.

Williams, ed., English historical documents volume V: 1485-1558 (1967), pp. 192-201 (a description of England in an early Italian ‘relation’, c.1500)  CLASS 4         1550-1650: COURT RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS    With the creation of extensive legal systems in the later sixteenth century, court records survive detailing occupations; these relate both to prosecuted offences and to administrative matters like wills and inventories for inheritance purposes. Household account books also indicate who was paid for what goods or services, although account books’ survival is much patchier than court records because they rarely made it to an archive. With the advent of printing in England, Thomas Tusser published his guide to husbandry and housewifery (what we would call agriculture) and William Harrison described the social order.Tusser, T., An hundred good pointes of husbandry (1557) William Harrison, Description of England (1577 and 1587)Court depositions in Women’s worlds in seventeenth-century England, ed.

Spicksley (2012) CLASS 5         Essay guidance and review of databases for Class 6 CLASS 6          1650-1750: PARISH REGISTERS & TAX LISTINGSParish registers recorded baptisms, marriages and burials from the mid-sixteenth century.  Sometimes parish clerks noted the occupations of fathers (for baptisms), and the Occupational Structure project of the Cambridge Group for the History of Population & Social Structure has collected these data for 1100 parishes which consistently recorded male occupations in the period 1695-1730 (referred to as the c.1710 database). We will use Access and Excel in this class to analyse different geographical areas from the database. Baptismal registers do not record women’s occupations, but these do sometimes appear in tax listings, which record the occupations of household heads of both sexes.Data sets from the Occupational Structure Project: Parish register dataset  c.1710Tax listings: Bristol St Nicholas (1692), Denham (1749) CLASS 7          1650-1750: AUTOBIOGRAPHY, POETRY AND FICTIONThis period saw an exponential growth in print production. Autobiographical writing as we know it began in this period, both for private purposes and for the press. The novel appeared as a literary form for the first time in 1688 with Aphra Behn’s Oronooko, and reached full development with Daniel Defoe. Poetry acquired a mass market, and the stage was now open to women as well as men. All forms of writing were available to literate women and men -- as a way to make a living, as well as providing a means to write about making a living.Autobiography of William Stout of Lancaster (1665-1752), ed.

The Occupational Structure project has collected these data from 11,400 parishes around the country, creating the first national survey available for this period. We will consider how the distribution of male occupations in the period 1813-20 differs from that which we saw for c.1710.Data set from the Occupational Structure Project:  1813-20 parish register data CLASS 9         1750-1850: INVESTIGATORS AND DIARISTSThis period sees the beginning of investigations into the problem of poverty on a national level, from individual surveys in the 1790s to the 1842 parliamentary enquiry into working conditions. These surveys sought explanations for dependence on poor relief or for high mortality, immorality or illiteracy. Personal memoirs including diaries and autobiographies written by the literate offer insight into the nature of work and the choices and constraints involved.David Davies, F.M.

The Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962) split France and led to the creation of two new régimes: the French Fifth Republic in Europe and the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria in North Africa. Without ever gaining control of Algerian territory, the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) managed to win the war on the terrain of public opinion in Algeria, in the French metropole and on the world stage.This option allows students the opportunity to closely study one of the most iconic conflicts of the 20th century using a wide range of written, visual and audio sources in the original French. Students will be able to see for themselves how participants in the Algerian War of Independence captured the public’s attention using propaganda films, radio broadcasts, spectacular acts of violence, posters and public speeches.A prior knowledge of French is required for this course, and students will receive additional language classes to help read the sources. The option is designed to bring students with A2 or AS-level French up to a level where they will be able to work with a range of primary and secondary source material in French. Primary source material will be in French, and secondary reading will draw on recent cutting-edge research in both French and English. The language component of the course will be taught by Dr Anne-Laure Brevet.French propaganda poster, 1959, Archives Nationales d'Outre-Mer, 9Fi344 Introductory reading:*Gillo Pontecorvo, Battle of Algiers (1966), [film, 120 mins.]*Sylvie Thénault, Histoire de la guerre d’indépendance algérienne, Paris, 2005.*Todd Shepard, The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France, Ithaca, 2006.*James McDougall, A History of Algeria, Cambridge, 2017.*Matthew Connelly, A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria’s Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post-Cold War Era, Oxford, 2002.Martin Evans, Algeria: France’s Undeclared War, Oxford, 2011.Thénault, Peyroulou, Bouchène and Siari Tengour (eds.), Histoire de l’Algérie à la période coloniale, Paris/Algiers, 2012.Mohammed Harbi, Le FLN, mirage et réalité des origines à la prise du pouvoir (1945-1962), Paris, 1980.Benjamin Stora, La gangrène et l’oubli: la mémoire de la guerre d’Algérie, Paris, 1998. Week 1: A Part of France? c.1945-1954This class establishes the background to the war by looking back at France’s long colonial rule in Algeria, which was declared part of French territory in 1848. What did it mean to say Algeria was a part of France, and how was this claim contested by Algerian nationalist movements? Week 2: Revolution! The FLN’s Insurrection 1954-58Starting with the attacks on 1 November 1954, the FLN was able in a few years to impress, scare or cajole a wide swathe of the Algerian population into supporting it, defeating rival nationalist movements and gaining widespread international recognition as the legitimate representative of the Algerian people. This session will look at how the FLN deployed spectacular acts of violence, careful propaganda, and diplomatic activity to grab attention and spread its revolutionary agenda. Week 3: Counter-Insurgency, 1956-1960This session examines the French response to the FLN’s insurrection. From 1956, successive governments oversaw a massive escalation of the French presence in Algeria that combined military action with the increased provision of social services. How did French governments try to gain the support of the majority of the Algerian population, as well as convincing the rest of the world that French rule in North Africa was legitimate? Week 4: Affairs and Controversies This session looks at the changing nature of metropolitan public opinion on the war, by focusing on a number of high-profile controversies that splashed the covers of the French press, from the French army’s use of torture to investigations into conditions in detention camps. How did shifting media coverage and censorship affect what the French public understood violence in Algeria? Week 5: Symbols of Liberation – Women in the War:Neither the French government nor the FLN gave Algerian women much effective political power, but both used images of women extensively to claim that they represented all of Algeria. While the French government argued that France was emancipating Algerian women from a retrograde Islamist movement, the FLN put its revolutionary female fighters at the forefront of its international image. This session explores why gendered representations were so important to both sides’ propaganda. Week 6: The French Civil War and The OAS, 1958-1962This session looks at the emergence of a new player in the war: the Organisation Armée Secrète (OAS), a militant organisation of French settlers that entered into violent conflict with both the French government and the FLN. How did the settlers try to mobilise the attention of the metropolitan public against the French government? At first they did so successfully, in the May 1958 that ended the Fourth Republic, and then unsuccessfully, through the failed coup of 1961 and the formation of the violent Organisation Armée Secrète (OAS). Week 7: 1962 - A Very Violent Peace This session examines the cataclysmic ‘end’ of the conflict in 1962. Why was that it was after the French government and the FLN signed a peace agreement in March 1962 that some of the worst violence erupted? We will look at how both sides tried to project images of peace and negotiation in spite of mounting violence and displacement, as the triumphant independence of Algeria in July 1962 was set against the backdrop of mass settler exodus and civil war among the FLN leadership. Week 8: Memory Wars Did the war to control public opinion ever really end? Issues of legitimacy and representation of the conflict are still very much up for grabs among both historians and politicians. This session looks at a number of controversies over the war years on both sides of the Mediterranean up to the present day, including debates about the role of torture in the French army, arguments about the place of the FLN as the founder of the Algerian nation, and alleged connections between the war and racial relations in France today. Bibliography © 2017 University of Cambridge

This course takes the 'Bandung moment' as a starting point from which to explore the theme of anti-imperialist thought and action and Afro-Asian solidarity in the global history of the twentieth century.Anti-imperialist thought and practice in the twentieth century took on a variety of guises, in terms of its ideological underpinnings, modes of expression and ultimate aims, and is therefore ideally suited to comparative analysis. To this end, we consider anti-imperialist thought from a series of angles: revolution and violence, socialism and economic thinking, religion, culture and universal human rights, with an eye to comparisons and connections across time and space. Running through all of the classes will be an interrogation of competing ideas of freedom, its meaning and the best path towards its realization.This course offers an introduction to global and transnational history and to the regional histories of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. It will take advantage of recent literature on the Bandung conference itself as a foundational moment in the making of the post-colonial world as well as a host of recent studies of the intellectual, cultural and social history of anti-imperialism, approached through a transnational framework of analysis. There is a wealth of source material available in English and in translation which will both provide the basis for class discussions and provide extremely rich opportunities for Long Essay projects. The published and unpublished writings and speeches of revolutionaries, intellectuals, politicians, officials and journalists will form the major body of source material, but use will also be made of images and film.Preliminary reading:* Roeslan Abdulgani, The Bandung Connection: The Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung in 1955, Singapore: Gunung Agung, 1981* George McTurnan Kahin, The Asian-African Conference: Bandung, Indonesia, April 1955.

The leaders of the new republic appealed directly to the international community. Its first prime minister, the westernised socialist, Sutan Sjahrir, took Indonesia’s cause to the United Nations. Its first president, Sukarno, unleashed a more charismatic, populist appeal to what he termed, the ‘New Emerging Forces’. This class examines the Bandung Conference of 1955 against the political thinking of the Indonesian revolution. Its international networks were complex and of long duration. It was characterised by attempts to reconcile different ideological traditions, such as in the thought of Tan Malaka, a prophet of a new ‘Aslia’; in the synthetic ‘Nasakom’ (nationalism, Islam, Communism) of Sukarno, and the socialist internationalism of Sjahrir. The class examines the precursors and planning of the 1955 Bandung conference; the role of powers such as India and China; its ideas and forms of diplomacy, and the birth of non-alignment. Was Bandung a gathering of nation-states rather than a movement of peoples? What was its imaginative purchase across the global South?Class 2: Precursors to Bandung: the roots of revolution and anti-imperialism inAfrica and AsiaBy the end of the First World War, anti-imperialist and revolutionary movements in the colonial world had begun to use new networks and to seek  new constituents, both nationally and internationally. In February of 1927, Jawaharlal Nehru attended the Congress of Oppressed Nationalities in  Brussels on behalf of the Indian National Congress. Delegates from 37 colonised countries met alongside supporters from Europe and the U.S. In a speech to the Brussels Congress often cited as a harbinger of non-alignment, Nehru argued that ‘the great problem of the near future will be American imperialism, even more than British imperialism. Or, it may be, and all indications point to it, that the two will join together to create a powerful Anglo-Saxon bloc to dominate the world.’ Speaking on U.S. imperialism in Latin America, Nehru emphasised the shared struggle of colonized and oppressed people around the world, and the necessity of working together to overcome imperialism. At the same Congress, he was elected to the Executive Council of the League Against Imperialism, (Ligue contre l’imperialisme et l'oppression colonial) an organisation affiliated with Comintern which aimed to establish itself as a League of Nations for the colonized world. Later that year, he attended the tenth anniversary celebration of the October revolution in Moscow. Also in 1927, the fourth Pan-African Congress met in Harlem, New York, addressing concerns about racialised oppression and violence in Anglophone Africa and the U.S., the drain of resources from African colonies by European colonial powers, and the necessity for accountable governance and home rule in West Africa and the West Indies. And in the same year the Ligue de defense de la race Negre, newly under Afro-Caribbean leadership, called in La Race Negre for the collaboration between Francophone black intellectuals and workers, and a student-led Pan-Africanism. How can we explain the remarkable explosion and convergence of global anti-imperial movements during the 1920s? And how did such movements influence postcolonial internationalism? This class explores the pre-history of Bandung by focussing on revolutionary and anti-imperial movements in colonial India, Africa, and Indonesia between 1917 and 1940, looking at how anti-imperial movements began to take on revolutionary aims and to formalise international partnerships.Class 3: Human RightsIn his account of the Bandung Conference, the Lebanese diplomat and philosopher, and former member of the commission which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Charles Malik, wrote that: ‘One of the basic issues on which we were sharply divided… was the question of Human Rights. What are the ultimate fundamental Human Rights? For the Communists these rights are for the most part social and economic rights; but for some of the rest of us the ultimate human rights that should now be guaranteed by the world and by the diverse nations are the personal, legal, political rights to freedom’. This class explores the theme of human rights in the history of anti-imperialist thought, engaging with recent literature on the role of human rights in decolonization. For the historian Samuel Moyn, anti-imperialism and decolonization had nothing to do with human rights. In contrast, for Roland Burke, human rights were at the centre of the decolonization process. In this class, we will explore this debate by looking at the competing ways in which human rights were conceptualised in the colonial world, both at the Bandung conference itself and in wider traditions of anti-imperial thought. Was it possible to have a universal conception of human rights? What was the relationship between individual human rights and rights to national self-determination, and how did this relationship change between the 1940s and the 1960s? Did freedom lie in protecting political rights or in the fulfilment of social and economic rights? How might conceptions of duty be integrated into a theory of human rights?Class 4: Violence and RevolutionThe ‘Bandung moment’ was a tumultuous time across much of the colonial world. While some territories, such as the Gold Coast/Ghana, Senegal, Morocco, and Tunisia, witnessed a relatively peaceful transition of power from Britain and France to the newly anointed leaders of independent states, others descended into a violent cycle of insurgency and counter-insurgency. This was the case in British Malaya, Kenya, and Cyprus, where the British declared ‘emergencies’, introducing a swathe of repressive measures in an attempt to quell local contestation, and in Algeria, whose brutal war of independence, which lasted from 1954 to 1962, threatened the very stability of the French Republic.In this class, we will look at a number of writings which examined the intimate relationship between colonialism and violence, and asked whether violence might serve to put an end to colonialism and forge a new world order. We will focus in particular on a number of writers from France and its empire who analysed, and criticised, the various forms of violence – both psychological and physical – that characterised what the French scholar Georges Balandier christened the ‘colonial situation’. These range from the existentialist philosopher and engaged intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre, to the poet and Communist deputy for Martinique Aimé Césaire, the Tunisian Jewish novelist Albert Memmi, and the Martiniquais psychiatrist Frantz Fanon, who experienced the violence of colonialism first hand while working in Algeria. All published stinging rebukes to colonialism in the 1950s and early 1960s, which chronicled the considerable violence of colonial rule, and suggested ways to overturn imperialism. What political events led them to write these, and how did their intellectual formations and lived experiences influence their arguments? How typical were their arguments, and what claims did those who disagreed with them make? How did they influence debate in France, and further afield, in the immediate wake of their publication? And how have they been read and understood in the decades since Bandung?Class 5: SocialismFrom the beginning of the twentieth century, critics of imperialism argued that imperialism was fundamentally an economic phenomenon which drained wealth from the colonised world to the West. Regaining economic independence was a central element of anti-imperial thinking. And for many, it seemed axiomatic that capitalism itself was at fault, serving metropolitan economies but not the needs of colonial peoples. But if some form of socialism was the route to economic prosperity based on equality and economic justice, what should that socialism look like? How might an Arab, Indian or an African socialism differ from Western traditions of socialist thought? In the era of the Cold War, how could leaders navigate a path that allowed them to pursue economic justice and employ a global language of socialism while pursuing a political course of non-alignment between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.? Should newly independent countries turn to the U.S. or the U.S.S.R for technical expertise or instead seek to exchange ideas and build connections across the post-colonial world? In this class, we look at a range of thinkers from across the Afro-Asian world, the roots of their socialist thought and the different types of socialism they proposed.Class 6: Islamist anti-imperialismThis class will examine the broad phenomenon of Islamist anti-imperialism across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. It will focus on the diverse ideologies that make up Islamist anti-imperialist thought, look at the manner in which these ideas are articulated in various contexts, and discuss the aims of Islamist anti-imperialist thinkers and activists. Central to these ideas are the construction of alternative Islamic political geographies and frameworks that would be implemented once freedom from imperialist rule had been won. Islamist anti-imperialism had its roots in the nineteenth century, and played a key role in many revolts and broader anti-imperial movements during the twentieth century. This class will consider how existing binaries between Islamists vs. Europe/‘the West’ can be nuanced through discussing case studies from the Ottoman Empire, Africa, and the secular empire of the Soviet Union.Class 7: Language and CultureThis class explores anti-imperialist thought in the domain of culture. Many anti-imperialist thinkers agreed that culture was a central battle ground in the fight against colonialism. But where they disagreed was on the form which cultural independence should take. In this class, we will read the writings of a number of those who reflected on what cultural independence might mean. For Léopold Senghor and Aimé Césaire, the philosophy of négritude, developed in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s offered a way of reclaiming cultural authenticity through a new articulation of black identity, but for others négritude seemed to accept the negative stereotypes which had legitimised colonialism. The question of language also prompted lively debate. Did using colonial languages mean accepting colonial or neo-colonial domination or not? For the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, colonial languages could be turned to anti-colonial ends, while the Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiong’o rejected English in favour of the Kikuyu language. We look at the origins of these debates in the intellectual culture of the 1930s, and consider how they were reworked in the era of decolonization.Class 8: Legacies of BandungThis class will explore the political, diplomatic, intellectual and cultural legacies of the ‘Bandung moment’.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Section A contains specific, targeted questions whose wording may not be altered.  Section B outlines broad topics within which a student could devise a more precise title, in consultation with the teacher of the option, who must formally approve the final title.  Option teachers must ensure that the title eventually chosen relates to the overall issues developed by the option, and that there is adequate source material and secondary literature available to the student.Skills ExaminedThe basic skills to be tested are similar to those expected in a supervision essay: the ability to argue clearly and cogently; to expound the issues involved in a given topic or problem; to evaluate interpretations and their relevance to the evidence on which historical argument is based.  Essays may vary in the extent of their treatment of historiography depending on the approaches of individual options, but because many Themes and Sources options focus particularly on primary source material, students are expected, where possible, to pay special attention to evaluating sources, e.g. by discussing and comparing their reliability and explaining their value for the historian. Sophisticated discussion of such matters raised by a question or topic may constitute the main contents of an essay.  However, in other cases students may be expected to concentrate more on secondary literature; advice will be given about the most suitable course of action appropriate to each essay title.  In addition, students should show ability to use footnotes and to present an adequate bibliography of the sources and literature used.The Long Essay provides the opportunity for students to show how well they have grasped the general issues raised by the option and their ability to analyse them in terms of a particular historical problem.  It can often be written using the materials provided in the source books (or similar source material indicated by option teachers) and supplemented by secondary reading.  Again, more precise guidance on this point will be given in individual options.  Students may be expected to show some initiative in finding and identifying literature on their subject, but the option teachers will provide sufficient material to make a start.The marking criteria for assessment of Themes and Sources Long Essays are available here (see p.5).Writing the Long EssayDuring the Easter Term there will be a ninth class and an individual supervision of 30-45 minutes (which will be arranged with one of the class teachers) devoted to discussing the requisite content, research methods, and format of the Long Essay, amongst other general issues.  The supervision is also an opportunity to discuss the nature of a question and its relation to the overall option theme, as well as bibliography, and for the teacher to give more general advice concerning structure and presentation.  Students should give careful thought to the choice of questions before the supervision and if possible narrow down their choice to one or two questions or topics.  Students are also advised to look at some of the reading in advance, so as to make best use of the supervision.Students should note that as this is an examination paper, this is the only individual tuition permitted and no further supervision is provided during the course of their work on the Long Essay. It is permissible to approach option teachers to ask for further bibliographical advice at a later stage, but they will not provide further supervision, read drafts or give further advice concerning the content of an essay.  In the interests of equity and to preserve the integrity of the examination, Directors of Studies have no involvement in the preparation of the Long Essay.  While they may assist in planning of work schedules, they must on no account be approached to discuss content or to read or comment on drafts of the Long Essay, nor is it permissible to ask other teachers or graduate students to do so.It should be emphasised that the bulk of the work necessary for this paper must be done during the LONG VACATION.  Because of difficulties of access to libraries during that time, a lengthy period has been allowed for completion and submission of the Long Essay.  Students should plan their work carefully in advance so that some preliminary work is done before going down for the Long Vacation and so that a final draft is ready before coming up for the Michaelmas Term in the second year.  The Christmas vacation should only be used for final corrections and adjustments, so that a completed and revised essay can be submitted at the beginning of the Lent Term.The Faculty Style Guide (available on the website) gives detailed guidance about word count, presentation, footnotes and bibliography, and is essential reading.Submission of Long EssaysThe Long Essay must be submitted to the Themes and Sources Secretary in the History Faculty by 3.30pm on the first Thursday of Lent Full Term.Late submission will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Your College must apply to the Secretary of the Applications Committee for an extension to a deadline and should not approach the Chair of Examiners directly. Any extension will be for a specified period. Applications must be made in reasonable time to enable the Secretary to consult the Chair.  An essay submitted later than the date specified by the Chair of Examiners, or by the due date if no extension has been granted, will not be accepted  (University Ordinances, Chapter III, Section 2, Regulation 7 refers). Students are required to submit TWO hard copies and ONE digital copy of their Long Essay, on the day that the essay is due.  All copies of the Long Essay must be typed, unless permission to the contrary has been granted in advance by the Themes and Sources Convenor, which will only happen in exceptional cases.A completed Cover Sheet should be stapled or securely attached to the front of each hard copy of the Long Essay, ensuring that all information is clearly legible.  The full title of the essay should be repeated at the top of the first page of all copies, and particular attention should be paid to any supplementary rubric at the top of individual option papers.Students are required to submit the digital copy of their Long Essay to Turnitin UK via Moodle, the content of which must be identical with that of the hard copies.  Further instructions for the digital submission will be issued prior to the submission date.  Turnitin UK text-matching software is an online service that compares submitted work for matches with a database of material available online and with a ‘private’ database of previous submissions.  Twenty percent of each submission will be selected for scrutiny by the Academic Secretary, acting as Faculty Academic Integrity Officer.  Normally, this will be work highlighted by the Turnitin software as containing a significant amount of recognised text. Work recommended by Examiners for further investigation may also be selected for scrutiny. Originality reports for scrutinised work will be referred to the Examiners responsible for the academic assessment of the work if there is prima facie evidence of plagiarism or poor academic practice.Students will be asked to confirm their awareness of this process on a separate (unbound) Declaration form, which is to be handed-in at the time of submission.  Identifying information must not appear anywhere other than on this form.  The Declaration contains a statement about plagiarism, which is the unacknowledged use of the work of others as if it were original work.  All material must be fully referenced and acknowledged.  Plagiarism is a serious offence and will not be tolerated by the Faculty of History.  Further information about the Faculty’s use of Turnitin and how to avoid plagiarism, can be found on the Faculty website: Guidance on Plagiarism.  The University also publishes detailed guidance here: http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/plagiarism/students/Students are reminded to take care of their work and to back-up text, keep extra copies separately etc.  Students, and not the Faculty, are responsible for submitting their essays on time.  Computer difficulties, stolen equipment, failure to allow sufficient time for printing problems etc. will not be accepted as excusable reasons for late submission.Finally, please note that the essay will not be returned after the completion of the class list, but will be retained by the Board of Examiners for 6 months like any other examination script.  If students wish to keep a copy for their own purposes, they should bear this in mind before submitting the essay.Related contentHistory Faculty Style Guide © 2017 University of Cambridge

At micro level we ask how individuals and households worked to survive and thrive in the context of the shifting sets of material resources and social and political relations with which they lived and, in some cases, sought to change. At macro level we examine the political economy of accumulation and development. The general aims of the course are to introduce the major themes and debates in the economic history of West Africa, from the slave trades to the present, and, equally, to encourage students to sample a wide range of different kinds of sources, quantitative and qualitative, used by economic historians of Africa and other regions of the Global South. Students are invited to develop a sense of the region and period as a whole, but within that to focus their own reading (and watching) of primary sources on selected themes and cases. No previous training is required in African history or economics, and the level of maths needed is basic numeracy. Again, the only language required is English. If you can read French, you will have the option in a couple of classes of choosing a French source instead of an English-language one.Preliminary readingHopkins, A.

Introduction: Wealth and Poverty in West African HistoryThis session briefly introduces:a) The region: its changing environmental and human characteristics over the last three centuries, including its long history of extra-subsistence, market-oriented economic activity, and, until the late twentieth century, a relatively high ratio of land (albeit often of fragile fertility) to labour.b) The debates, especially about the historical origins of (West) Africa’s relative poverty today: institutional, resource-based and cultural explanations offered by rival schools, and ‘internalist’ versus ‘externalist’ approaches.c) The primary sources, qualitative and quantitative: their problems and potential.Primary sourcesLevtzion, N., and J.E.P.

The Atlantic Slave Trade in West African contextWe ask how many people were shipped as slaves from West Africa; how this trade could have been profitable to both buyers and sellers, considering that labour was relatively scarce in the region; who gained from the trade; and how it affected economic development in the region, immediately and in the long term.Primary sourcesEltis, David, et al (2008 + updates), Voyages: the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database http://www.slavevoyages.org Please explore this amazing resource.Narrative of a freed slave, Mohammed Kaba/Robert Peart, in Letter from B.

Commercial, Political and Labour Transformations, 1804/7--c.1929We consider the interconnections between three fundamental transitions:a) From the export of slaves to export agriculture (‘legitimate commerce’): this began during the gradual decline of the Atlantic slave trade from West Africa (from 1807) and was intensified during the early colonial period, still often at the initiative of African entrepreneurs.b) From the formation of new Islamic states, notably the Sokoto Caliphate (1804) to the European colonization of West Africa, mainly during the ‘Scramble’ of 1879-c.1903. Some African entrepreneurs expected that colonial rule would make it easier for them to make and keep wealth.c) From slave to wage labour within the region: but prefaced by an expansion of slave-holding, supplying labour for cash-crop production, before the colonization; after which most European administrations proceeded to take a very gradual approach to implementing their promise to abolish slavery.Primary sourcesWilks, Ivor, ‘Dissidence in Asante Politics: two tracts from the late nineteenth century’, in Wilks, Forests of Gold, pp. 169-88 (‘lightly revised’ from a 1975 publication).

Economic Discontents, Hopes, and ‘Development’ under Middle and Late Colonialism, 1929-1960We discuss different strands of economic unhappiness, some of which were profound but largely beneath the surface of the political conflict of the era (notably struggles over the gender division of work and its rewards in household and community contexts), while others were much more visible to both African politicians and colonial administrations, because they challenged the domination of much of the economy by private European monopolies, the practices of colonial governments, and eventually colonial rule itself. Relatedly, and partly in specaific response to some of the mass discontents, an increasingly strong tendency emerged for states to be more active than before, both in seeking and spending revenue, often in the name of ‘development’, While our focus will be on what was happening within West Africa, it is important to take account of the international contexts, notably the trends in the world market for African primary products (adverse during the world depression and Second World War, much more positive in the 1950s) and the increasing critical pressures on the policies and principle of colonial rule, especially after 1945.Primary sourcesTete-Ansá, W., Africa at Work (New York: self-published, 1930), pp. 63, 68-73, 78-87.Meyer Fortes Papers from the Ashanti Social Survey (in Cambridge University Library):  a selection of copies of papers from file of widows’ testimonies, c.1945.Government correspondence on the Nigerian ‘General Strike’ of July 1945, in Martin Lynn (ed.), Nigeria, Part I, Managing Political Reform 1943-1953 (British Documents on the End of Empire, Series B, Volume 7) (London: Stationery Office, 2001), pp. 50-59.Central Office of Information, United Kingdom, Here is the Gold Coast (1947), www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlDSHqVhPZE  A 35-minute official film on poverty and development expenditure. Secondary sourcesFor general reference and broader contexts: John Iliffe, Africans: The History of a Continent (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition, 2007), pp. 219-72.Miles, John, ‘Rural protest in the Gold Coast: the cocoa hold-ups, 1908-1938’, in Clive Dewey and A.

Living Standards, Demographic and Structural Change under Colonial RuleThe beginning of West Africa’s transition from labour-scarcity to labour-surplus can be timed from the aftermath of the world influenza pandemic of 1918, since when the population has risen continuously, including probably a doubling by the end of colonial rule c.1960. Stimulated by colonial and African investments in improving transport, the growth of agricultural export economies entailed a degree of urbanization. Meanwhile, living standards varied considerably between different ecological zones: the cocoa-growing areas of southern Ghana and southwest Nigeria, and even the coastal, groundnut-exporting parts of Senegal and the Gambia, offered much more reward for farmers than the more isolated parts of the savanna, still less in the Sahel. Economic historians have focussed on comparing the real wages and other measures of living standards in non-settler economies (which comprised most of West Africa) with the settler and plantation colonies of much of central and southern Africa. While British West Africa, especially, does well in that comparison, its record was very unimpressive for the growth of manufacturing industry. Let us examine the strengths and weaknesses of the sources available on all these topics, and consider the uses and limits of the methods applied to them. As a primary-source case-study, we consider two pioneering quantitative studies from colonial Ghana. Cardinall was the Gold Coast Census Officer, and made an effort to estimate many things, including what we would now call GDP per capita.Primary sourcesCardinall, A.

Political Economy of Ghana: From Independence to Economic Liberalization, 1957-83Ghana has rightly been called ‘the perennial test-case’. It was the first country in West Africa to achieve independence from colonial rule (1957), under the charismatic leadership of Kwame Nkrumah, who took the economy on an increasingly state-led development path. By 1983 it had become the proverbial ‘basket case’, with an inexorably shrinking economy accompanied by multiple coups. Then a left-wing populist ‘revolutionary’ government, led by J. J. Rawlings, felt obliged to  reverse the policy trend of itself and its predecessors, and embark on systematic economic liberalization, in conjunction with loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Ghana became the most successful of the few conspicuously successful cases of ‘Structural Adjustment’ in Africa, with its economy growing by about 5% a year on average to the present. Rawlings held elections in 1992 under a new constitution. He won, but since then there have been two occasions on which the ruling party handed over power after election defeat. That never happened during the period we study, which includes Ghana’s first three republics, three conventional military regimes, and two Rawlings ‘revolutions’. We ask: how and why did this relatively prosperous newly-independent economy, then the world’s leading exporter of cocoa beans, fall into economic stagnation and then absolute decline by the late 1970s? By the early 1980s, the leading rational-choice political scientist of Africa, Robert Bates, was arguing that most post-colonial governments were essentially urban coalitions interested only in rewarding their own supporters and relaxed about the fate of the economy as a whole. Yet Rawlings’ government did reverse policy: why, and how did it succeed, if this was against the urban interests that supported it?Broadcasts and speeches by heads of statePresident Kwame Nkrumah, Dawn Broadcast, 8 April 1961. 10 pp.Colonel I.

Poverty and Wealth in Post-Independence West AfricaIt is arguable that since independence West Africa, like Sub-Saharan or at least tropical Africa as a whole, has seen one watershed in economic policy, and two in economic performance. The 1960s and 1970s saw, on the whole, a continuation of the trend established in the late colonial period, for growing state intervention in the economy. This was drastically reversed by Structural Adjustment in the 1980s, which established the liberal economic regime which essentially prevails to this day.  Meanwhile, in most countries in the region, economic growth outpaced the continued growth of population until after the international oil price rise of 1973; then broadly stagnated until roughly 1995, since when the Sub-Saharan Africa economies, in aggregate, have apparently grown about 2% faster than the population; though manufacturing, as a share of output, actually shrank. In this section we will ask:a) How sure are we about this (or any alternative) summary of the trends of economic performance, given that there are major weaknesses in the national economic statistics?b) What other kinds of evidence, qualitative and quantitative, can we adduce on economic and social changes in post-independence West Africa, including on education, health, the relative importance of the ‘formal’ and ‘informal’ sectors of the economy? c) What can be said about changes in the motivation and capacity of states to facilitate economic (and broader human) development, including in the context of relations with foreign firms, states and international agencies? On this, we use the largest state in West Africa as a key case-study.‘Primary’ sourcesA selection of data series covering most of the period.World Bank, Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action (Washington DC: World Bank, 1981).

How does nature give shape to history, and how is it shaped itself by human action through history? How have categories like ‘nature’, ‘climate’ or ‘environment’ emerged and been understood? This course takes a transnational view of how features of the natural world – forests, rivers, poles, mountains, climate – have played a role in history; both in how they have been exposed to physical change, but also acted as resources for the imagination and become objects of research. It will introduce students to the wide range of sources and interdisciplinary demands of environmental history. We will draw on examples from around the globe, and also consider the issue of appropriate scale in the study of history, from local case studies through to arguments about the planet. We will examine how certain categories such as ‘frontier’ or wilderness’ or ‘pristine’ get attached to regions of nature, how natural features come to embody local and national identities, and how geographical spaces become ‘gendered’, associated with the activity of men or women. Equally, this option will keep to the fore scholarship that links nature, humans, and resource use. Are the resources of nature limited? How has scientific knowledge about the environment affected, if at all, our use or protection of it?   Food, resources and technology are the staples of environmental history, and we will discuss connections between environmental history on the one hand, and economic and political history on the other.IMPORTANT NOTE – The reading on the list below is indicative of the kind of works you can expect to read on the course. As well as preparing the sources, secondary readings will be allocated to individuals each week, and generally comprise a book chapter, single article or work of equivalent length. You are of course free to read more!Class 1: Introduction (Paul Warde) We will discuss the objectives and overview of the course, the form of discussions, reading expectations. We will establish the frameworks of both world history (in various traditions) and environmental history. Reading will begin to explore historiography and methodology. What questions can be asked of and through world environmental history? Through what methods of research are they answered? What are the scales of environmental history?Introductory readingJ. R.

European maritime and territorial expansion had environmental impacts on these ‘frontiers’ that were sometimes acute, sometimes chronic. This week the environmental legacy of imperial history is examined, focusing on two dynamics. First, we look at ecological and political histories of disease and imperial encounters. This allows us to examine one founding tradition of environmental history-writing: the “Columbian exchange” or, elsewhere, “the fatal impact”. Second, we consider land and land-use: this is what environmental history, imperial history, and economic history have in common, especially in settler colonial contexts. Land-clearing, deforestation and resource depletion accompanied most imperial ventures, escalating over the industrialising 19th century. In turn, arguments about the ‘proper’ state and use of the land became an important justification for imperialism itself.Questions for discussion:Is the frontier central to environmental history?Was the idea of the frontier simply a tool of imperialist expansion?DocumentsBattiste Good, Winter Count, National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution.  (see also Candace S.

They became treated as sensitive indicators of whether ‘progress’ was being made, or ‘nature’ was being destroyed. Equally, as the source of key materials for fuel, construction and shipbuilding they became sites of contestation between different interests, whether states and imperial powers, industry, or peasants and indigenous peoples. This week we examine foundational texts in arguments over the effects and reasons for deforestation, sustainability, and subjecting forests to centralised control and management. How were arguments about the state of a resource, and measures of ‘decline’ or ‘sustainability’ established?

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the capacity of soil to support population and economic growth became a matter of increasing concern, particularly during the ‘Dust Bowls’; history could be read as a race between soil degradation and technological improvement. This week we examine a series of iconic texts that projected the state of the soil as a local and global problem for society, and developed the idea of the ‘environment’ as an area of anxiety and policy. We will focus in particular on the visual presentation of the state of the environment through painting and film.Questions for discussion:‘The history of the soil is a history of over-exploitation and reaction to the consequences.’ Discuss.‘Attitudes to the soil will tell you much about a society’s attitude to itself’.DocumentsEdward Ruffin, ‘An address on the opposite results of exhausting and fertilizing systems of agriculture’ (1852) in Edwin C.

Upstream and downstream movements must often be different. As well as routes for transport and travel, they present rich food resources but risk through flood. Technologies can tap into the power of water to run mills, generate electricity, and irrigate the land. Rivers have thus functioned as a major resource, source of both fertility and fear, and cause of contestation among the many users of the waters. Yet they also bring people ‘together’ as a mark of identity, and in very practical ways. The state and fate of the river become key direct indicators and carry metaphorical resonance for how power operates in particular societies. This week we will look at arguments about the appropriate use, and how they rivers are given personas and roles in culture.  We will examine sources on the issues of who takes responsibility for the river, and how it has appeared in song and literature.Questions for discussion:How useful are artistic representations of landscapes for reconstructing their history?How have rivers helped to forge the cultural and political identities of those living on their plains?DocumentsJimmy Nail & Mark Knopfler ‘Big River’, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_519h95XFsWood Guthrie, ‘Talking Columbia’, and ‘Roll on Columbia’, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z58V-NxJcEIProceedings of the Tyne Improvement Commission 1876–1968, 92 vols.

History, culture and ecology (London: Reaktion Books, 2013) Class 6: Climate (Paul Warde) The idea of human-induced (or ‘anthropogenic’) climate change is not a new one; it has been a commonplace in different periods of history, but with explanations that have shifted over time. Similarly, environmental historians have traced how historical authors believed climate profoundly influenced humanity, from deterministic theories about it shaping character and health, to current debates about the economic and environmental consequences of global warming.  This week we trace these ideas from Enlightenment debates about climatic determinism to the development of climate science and knowledge about of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels and its emergence in public debate in the 1960s and 70s. A crucial question to examine this week is how ‘expertise’ about the environment is established. What kind of knowledge or authority is required to be able to say what is really happening and whether it might be dangerous? Can something as big or amorphous as climate be ‘measured’, and how was this achieved?Questions for discussion:What was understood to be the ‘climate’?How do you become an expert in ‘the environment’?DocumentsWilliam Falconer, Remarks on the influence of climate on the Disposition and Temper of Mankind (1781), pp.109-129.Wallace S.

How can they also places of human history? Understanding the history of human engagement with the polar regions requires the frameworks of imperial history, environmental history and international history. This week we focus on the latter – the linked international history and environmental history poles, and especially of Antarctica. The continent was a site of imperial expansion and intense national struggles, but it also held out the possibility of a new kind of international commons for the twentieth century. The Antarctic Treaty, the International Geophysical Years, the possibility of UN trusteeship, all reflected international political matters that were unfolding elsewhere on the globe. Conversely, “environmentalism” has justified increasing exploration, occupation, and intervention into the region. This week we shall look in particular at the physical artefacts held at the Scott Polar Research Institute, and how they can operate as sources: from equipment to art, crockery and postage stamps.Questions for discussion:‘The history of Antarctica is a history of gender.’Why was the ‘race’ to the South Pole between Britons and Norwegians?DocumentsAnon., “Antarctic Treaty signed by IGY nations: Polar region established as neutral science reserve,” Science 130, no. 3389 (1959), pp.1641–44.The Antarctic Treaty, 1 December 1959.Scott Polar Research Institute, Picture Library and Museum.

They have been viewed by lowlanders as regions to be feared, but also of challenge – a place to demonstrate power, identity, virtue, and in more recent times, as a location for escape. This class will examine how mountains have been presented as an ‘other’, a place charged with special value that lies outside ‘normal’ society, but also as a goal for mountaineers, tourists, and scientific investigation. How to the supposedly more stringent conditions of the mountain reveal what is valued in society, or operate as a critique of its failings? Why has elevation been associated with more extreme experience or emotion? What kind of person belongs there?Questions for discussion:‘Mountainous regions are, as a rule, spaces of exception.’Why have mountain regions exercised such a pull on the imagination?DocumentsJohn Tyndall, Glaciers of the Alps (…), pp.172-93; 247-52: ‘Winter Expedition to the Mer de Glace, 1859’; ‘The Motion of Glaciers’. Leslie Stephen, The Playground of Europe (London: Longman, Green & Co., 1871), ch.13: ‘The Regrets of a Mountaineer’. 10J.B.L.

The Fund supports students who would not otherwise be able to visit or access the primary source materials necessary to complete a Part II dissertation, through the provision of grants for travel and research expenses related to their study. Its annual yield is likely to be c. £1,200. The Faculty is able to make a small number of grants each year to specially deserving cases. Successful candidates are expected to demonstrate both academic and financial need. Applicants will be expected to make the academic case for consulting specific archival materials (either in person or by obtaining copies); to indicate the total sum requested (with breakdown of costs) and to give details of other possible sources of funding, such as college travel grants (and to state whether there are applications pending or grants received). Directors of Studies shall provide a supporting statement.The Fund Managers are the members of the Dissertation Titles Committee (as appointed by the Faculty Board), who shall, at their annual meeting to approve Dissertation Titles, make awards from the Fund. The number and size of awards are at the discretion of the Managers, but the Faculty Board suggests awards in the range of £100-£300.Applications must be submitted with the Dissertation Application form. Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.Successful applicants will be notified of awards at the same time that approval of the Dissertation title is notified. Award holders are required to submit, with their Dissertations, a short report of 250-500 words on the use made of the award. Reports may be sent to the donor and retained by the Seeley Library. Awards will not be made in advance of expenditure: expenses incurred will be reimbursed on presentation of receipts to the Faculty Accounts Office. Any moneys unexpended each year shall be added to the capital in the Fund. These regulations were approved by Faculty Board on 20 November 2012. The application form may be downloaded here.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

If you are considering using interviews for your research, we strongly recommend the advice and support offered by the Oral History Society through its website here Ethical considerations, including the protection of sources, are central to the exercise of responsible research using interview methods. To this end the Faculty has put in place a procedure for approval. This is outlined below, alongside some initial advice on the handling of oral history materials.2.    Design and Approval2.1.      Oral History ApprovalYou must discuss the practicalities and ethical issues of your oral history interviews with your supervisor, and, with them, complete the Oral History Approval form (Word / PDF).  This is to be forwarded to the Academic Secretary (academic.secretary@hist.cam.ac.uk), for final approval.2.2.       Retrospective approval for exceptional circumstances3.    Undertaking Interviews[1] Before an interview takes place, interviewers should:3.1.        Obtain ConsentSupply the prospective interviewee with the Oral History Information Sheet and Consent Form (Word / PDF).Information should be given on how informants for the study are being recruited and how the interview will be used (for use in your thesis/dissertation, and/or for transcription, and/or for publication). Ensure that the interviewee has understood this background information and ask him/her whether or not they wish to remain anonymous for the purposes of the study. All informants should sign the consent form.Where an interviewee is non-English speaking, it is your responsibility to translate the consent form into their native language.Where an interviewee is illiterate, a recording of the interviewee’s verbal consent will be sufficient.3.2.        Determine the preferences of the interviewee as to the location and conduct of the interview (for example, the presence of other persons; subject matter or personal references to be avoided, whether or not he/she agrees to be audio-recorded).3.3.        Carry out research and acquire sufficient knowledge to conduct an interview of the best possible standard.3.4.        Consider the purpose of the interview and the range of possible future uses to which it might be put, assessing potential implications for the safety and dignity of informants.3.5.        During the conduct of an interview, interviewers should try to ensure that the interviewee's preferences are abided by; treat interviewees with respect and courtesy.4.     After the interview: Working with Oral History Sources4.1.       Transcription and AnalysisEven a small number of interviews will produce hours of audio (and/or video) and thousands of words for analysis. Most historians find that the best way to work with this material is to make full transcripts of each interview. This is a laborious and time-consuming process, but allows you to get into the interview and understanding the source in a much greater depth. It is not, however, absolutely required. Other researchers use software packages such as atlas.ti or envivo which allow them to catalogue audio and video files in detail. These can also be used in tandem with transcripts.At the very least, you should seek to fully index each interview (with contents and time indices of key passages) and transcribe the passages that will be used in your work. The Oral History Society provides further advice here . 4.2.        StorageIt is vital that you store your interviews, transcripts, consent documents and other related materials safely and securely. This is your responsibility as a researcher, and a commitment you have made to your interviewees. Ensure that materials are backed up or copied in two independent locations. Keep interview recordings, transcripts and source identifying-documents securely (that is, in locked spaces) to protect the privacy and any requested anonymity of interviewees.It is your responsibility to keep these documents at least until the examination process is complete (as they may be requested by the examiners) and it is highly advisable that these are kept for longer since you may publish your work or return to it at a later date.5.     Submission of Dissertation and Supporting MaterialsTranscripts of interviews and other materials, including interview guides or questionnaires are not normally submitted with the dissertation. If, however, in consultation with your supervisor it seems appropriate to include any of these, they may be submitted as appendices.Please note, however, that examiners may request to see the transcripts and audio/video recordings used in the research for the purposes of assessment, as they may seek to check any other primary material. If you cannot produce these on request this may lead to any parts of the dissertation based on them being discounted.In general, your thesis will explain your oral history methodology in its introduction.The primary source section of your bibliography must include a list of interviewees (anonymised as necessary), indicating the date and location of the interview, unless the latter compromises the anonymity of the source. (First issued July 2016) Links to:Oral history approval form  Word / PDFParticipant's information sheet and consent form   Word / PDF[1] Adapted from: Alan Ward and Oral History Society, ‘OHS Ethical Guidelines’ (2003) http://www.oralhistory.org.uk/ethics/index.php The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

These involve a different style of study from the weekly essay. Undergraduates select a Special Subject from a list of options. This gives the opportunity for advanced study in depth of an important historical process or problem. Teaching is by Faculty lectures and/or classes, spread across the third year. Undergraduates are expected to do the reading in their own time. The reading concentrates on primary sources, again of a variety of types.The Special Subject constitutes two of the five papers (Papers 2 and 3) on a one-year Part II course - 40% of the total. Work for your Special Subject is examined by means of a Long Essay (Paper 2) submitted during the Easter Term and a three-hour exam on 'gobbets' taken from the set sources (Paper 3) in late May/early June.The list of Special Subjects available for any particular year are listed under the Part II papers.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

They visited postwar new housing (ranging from affluent gated communities to low and medium-rise social housing), pedestrianized shopping streets, a modernist roundabout, and gentrified Victorian terraces.Their work echoes the investigations of the 1930s and 40s organisation Mass Observation, in seeking to capture the practices of everyday life, while also recognising the politics of access, ownership and public space.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

We took a day trip to St Ives in Huntingdonshire, walking from there across the meadow that is a flood plain for the River Ouse to three nearby villages: Hemingford Grey, Hemingford Abbots and Houghton. We studied the data from 19th-century censuses, to see the proportions of women and men employed in these four locations in different sectors of the economy, and then went to see the traces of those historic local economies that remain in the built environment and the landscape.The market town of St Ives had much more employment in retail and in transport than the villages, and nearly twice the female labour force participation rate. Hemingford Grey (pop c.1000) had  millers and maltsters in addition to its agriculture, though no trace survives of mill or malt kilns, and many men and women making shoes and clothing. By contrast, Hemingford Abbots (pop c.500) was purely agricultural. We ended the day at the 18th-century water mill at Houghton, which still grinds flour in the summer months under the auspices of the National Trust.The Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

After a brief tour of the armoury gallery, Senior Technician Andrew Maloney took the group behind the scenes into the museum's Applied Arts department. Wearing their protective purple gloves, students handled a variety of objects dating back to the sixteenth century, including fragments of mail, a breast and back plate, gauntlets, greaves, and tassets. From Bartels, they learned about the materiality, construction, and function of both mail and plate armour while handling and inspecting these items up close. Decorative techniques such as etching, bluing, embossing, and gilding were similarly examined. Students also explored the iconographic themes most commonly found on early modern armour and in small groups, dissected the mythological and Christian imagery adorning a beautiful German breast plate from the museum's permanent display. Their visit concluded by looking at weapons, including a mace, a rapier, and a hunting sword with its scabbard.Photos: Victoria BartelsThe Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship Internal Competition 2018 is now open.

It may be supplemented by course-specific guidance from Faculties and Departments.Plagiarism is defined as submitting as one's own work, irrespective of intent to deceive, that which derives in part or in its entirety from the work of others without due acknowledgement. It is both poor scholarship and a breach of academic integrity.Examples of plagiarism include copying (using another person's language and/or ideas as if they are a candidate's own), by:Plagiarism might also arise from colluding with another person, including another candidate, other than as permitted for joint project work (i.e. where collaboration is concealed or has been forbidden). A candidate should include a general acknowledgement where he or she has received substantial help, for example with the language and style of a piece of written work.Plagiarism can occur in respect to all types of sources and media:Acceptable means of acknowledging the work of others (by referencing, in footnotes, or otherwise) is an essential component of any work submitted for assessment, whether written examination, dissertation, essay, registration exercise, or group coursework.  The most appropriate method for attribution of others' work will vary according to the subject matter and mode of assessment. Faculties or Departments should issue written guidance on the relevant scholarly conventions for submitted work, and also make it clear to candidates what level of acknowledgement might be expected in written examinations. Candidates are required to familiarize themselves with this guidance, to follow it in all work submitted for assessment, whether written paper or submitted essay, and may be required to sign a declaration to that effect. If a candidate has any outstanding queries, clarification should be sought from her or his Director of Studies, Course Director or Supervisor as appropriate.Failure to conform to the expected standards of scholarship (e.g. by not referencing sources) in examinations or assessed work may affect the mark given to the candidate's work. In addition, suspected cases of the use of unfair means (of which plagiarism is one form) will be investigated and may be brought to one of the University's Courts. The Courts have wide powers to discipline those found guilty of using unfair means in an examination, including depriving such persons of membership of the University, and deprivation of a degree.The University makes use of text-matching software for the purpose of plagiarism education and detection, and reserves the right to submit a candidate’s work to such a service. For this purpose, candidates consent to the submission of their papers to the service and for the submitted papers to form part of the service’s comparative source work database. To facilitate use of the service, students (and participating Examiners and Assessors) may be required to agree to the service provider’s end-user agreement and provide a limited amount of personal data upon registration to the service, for instance, their name, email address, and course details.(July 2016) - Statutes and Ordinances 2016, p.192No candidate shall make use of unfair means in any University examination. Unfair means shall include plagiarism* and, unless such possession is specifically authorized, the possession of any book, paper or other material relevant to the examination. No member of the University shall assist a candidate to make use of such unfair means.  (Statutes and Ordinances 2016, p. 191).* Plagiarism is defined as submitting as one's own work, irrespective of intent to deceive, that which derives in part or in its entirety from the work of others without due acknowledgement.Note that in all documentation produced prior to October 2015 this was known as Discipline Regulation 6.The Proctorial Notice for 2016 can be viewed on the Proctors' website.© 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of HistoryStudying at Cambridge
