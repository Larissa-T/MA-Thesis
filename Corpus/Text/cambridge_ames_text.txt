All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarize themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has wide academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely.Applicants must have good reading skills in the language appropriate to their chosen topic. All applicants must have an excellent command of the English language (evidenced by the appropriate English-language test scores). The following two MPhil Pathway Options will be offered for the MPhil in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Hebrew Studies) for 2018 - 2019:Papers for the Cairo Genizah MPhil pathway include:1. The Cairo Genizah: Paleography and CodicologyThis module will open with an introduction that will cover the history of the Cairo Genizah, its scope and contents, its discovery by western scholars, the dispersal of its materials to "Genizah collections" in Europe and the United States, and their occasional re-discovery in these collections. The main focus of the module will be on the fundamentals of Hebrew codicology and paleography, especially as these two disciplines relate to the Genizah manuscripts. Students will be introduced to the main concepts underlying the production of Hebrew codices and other written formats in the medieval Middle East. They will also learn to recognize the main varieties of Hebrew script that are encountered in the Genizah.2. Genizah GenresIn this module students will read Genizah manuscripts of texts relating to selected genres. These will include documents and poetry. The aim is to expose students both to a selection of the primary text materials with which a given field operates and provide them with an introduction to the research current in the discipline on the basis of secondary literature. If students have a knowledge of Arabic, they will have the opportunity to read Judaeo-Arabic documentary texts.3. Genizah languagesIn conjunction with their choice of genre, each student will select a language of specialization. Alongside work with the chosen genre, the student will then undertake an advanced study of the language in which the genre is composed, viz. Medieval Hebrew or Judaeo-Arabic. This module has the aim of improving language skills as well as exposing the student to a sample of literature composed in the selected language beyond the material that is available in the Genizah.OR:Papers for the Modern Hebrew Culture MPhil pathway include:1. Historical PerspectivesAn introduction to the history of modern Hebrew literature and culture, their scope and contents, their development in Eastern Europe and eventual migration outside of Europe, primarily to the Land of Israel. The module examines a variety of representative works (literary, poetic, cinematic, aesthetic) from the last 150 or so years that highlight different aspects of the major changes that marked Jewish history and society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, primarily the breakdown of tradition and the transformation from a predominantly religious society in eastern Europe to the secular and more pluralistic culture of the State of Israel today.2. Thematic PerspectivesStudents in this module examine more closely specific themes that preoccupy Israeli literature, cinema or cultural production. The module looks at literature, cinema, or other modern Hebrew cultural products (language, music, visual culture, material culture etc.) as media that both reflect and shape it by focusing primarily on aspects of ideology and history. By focusing on a limited number of works that engage with one major issue or theme students develop a deeper understanding of Israeli culture and the various forces that shaped it.3. Generic VarietiesIn conjunction with the previous two modules and based on the materials in both students in this module explore major genres in modern Hebrew culture—literary, cinematic, aesthetic—and the challenges these genres posed for writers, film-makers and cultural innovators. The first part of the module consists of an introduction to generic varieties in modern Hebrew literature and culture in their historical context. In the second part of the module, each student selects one medium and genre and develops a deeper acquaintance and understanding of it based on primary materials as well as secondary readings (theoretical and critical). The aim of the module is to expose students both to the varieties of modern Hebrew cultural media and genres as well as give them an opportunity for more focused critical work. Applicants for both MPhil Pathway options must have a sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to read medieval Hebrew primary sources. Students must take each of the three papers listed in either of the two options offered and submit a 15,000 word dissertation in mid-August.The one-year MPhil in Hebrew Studies has the following structure:The dissertation provides an opportunity to learn the process of carrying out research and will help train students to be a future researcher (in academia or elsewhere). Applicants should consider carefully the formulation of a potential MPhil dissertation topic before applying. They should be in touch with members of staff who would act as supervisors before submitting the final version of their dissertation proposal.Applicants for the PhD will be expected to have scored at least 67% or above (or the equivalent from an overseas University) in their Master's degree which should be related to the PhD programme they wish to pursue. All applicants should submit with their GRADSAF (graduate application) a workable and interesting research proposal and demonstrate that they have the required academic knowledge and skills to carry out their project.Admission is at the discretion of the Degree Committee, which judges each graduate applicant on his or her own merits and in accordance with its own set rules and regulations. For further information about this course and how to apply, please refer to the following webpage(s) on the Graduate Admissions website:http://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/amammphbs© 2017 University of Cambridge

All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarize themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has wide academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely. For the avoidance of confusion, although this course is an MPhil with taught elements the Graduate Admissions website identifies it as predominantly research. This is the correct course for which to apply. Applicants for this course will be expected to have a University qualification in either Hebrew or Arabic. At present, the following modules are offered:Papers for the Muslim Jewish Relations MPhil Pathway include:1. Muslim-Jewish Relations, FoundationsThis module introduces students to the analytical tools required for studying Muslim-Jewish relations, primary sources in translation and original language, bibliographical method, objectivity in the study of interfaith relations and controversial themes. Themes may include the Jewish languages of the Islamic world, key historical documents in the study of Muslim-Jewish Relations; Jewish and Muslim thought; Law and Society; the Ottoman Empire, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.2. Muslim-Jewish Relations, Special TopicsThese topics will generally focus on contemporary issues between Muslims and Jews and why these relations are important to understanding the position of religious minorities, faith identity and politics in the Middle East and North Africa. Comparisons will be made to Europe and the United States in order to understand how trends in the region are related to politics and social change elsewhere. Topics may include: Religious Identity and Politics in the Middle East and North Africa; Globalization, Faith and Identity in the Middle East and North Africa, Europe and the United States; Comparative Perspectives on Muslim-Jewish Relations in Middle East and North Africa and Europe; the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab Spring.3. Cairo GenizahIn this module students are given an introduction to the Genizah manuscripts and its importance for the study of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Middle Ages. Most of the teaching will be based on a selection of Genizah texts in Hebrew or Judaeo-Arabic. These will be read in edited form and also from the original manuscripts in the Taylor-Schechter Genizah collection in Cambridge (www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor-Schechter/Introduction.html)OR from:(OPTION 2) Persian Cultural HistoryApplicants for this course are expected to have a university qualification in Persian.This course offers readings in Persian cultural history, identifying persisting trends in Persian literature and cultural production from the medieval period down to modern times. These themes revolve around kingship and the image of the ideal prince, theories of justice and good government, and competing sources of secular and religious authority. Similarly, the motif of love, both earthly and divine, is a common thread running through Persian literature and entails also the extensive use of imagery of the natural world. In the modern world, the course examines a number of issues by studying Iranian cinema and focusing on gender, historical adaptation, nation and approaches to narration and resistance to dominant discourses, reflecting also on how the stories and legends of the classical tradition are adapted for contemporary literature and media.In discussing these topics, attention is paid to their visual as well as written representation.At present, the following modules are offered:Papers for the Persian Cultural History MPhil Pathway include:This module introduces some key texts of historical and hagiographical literature, exploring their different literary and narrative approaches to addressing essentially the same purpose, namely establishing the legitimacy and idealised image of both the rulers and the saints who form their subject matter. Poetry plays a large part in the delivery and expression of these topics and the module concentrates on readings that explore the relationship between history, sufism and poetry in Persian culture.This module focuses on texts written for princes and monarchs, which are meant to shape the knowledge and morality of the people at the top. Texts picturing the pre-Islamic royal history, Mirror for Princes, didactic prose and poetry… all these participate in informing the understanding and political intelligence of young princes. The course also looks at the practical results achieved during the life time of the monarchs: art historical elements of courtly life and historical events are analysed and discussed.The purpose of this module is to introduce the students to different approaches to analyzing cinematic form and studying culture through films. Each session, therefore, includes watching and discussing a film and reading one or two critical texts that examine different aspects of life and film production in Iran. The key cultural concepts are gender relations, resistance against dominant discourses, historical and intercultural adaptation, nation and nationalism, and cinematic narration. The one-year MPhil in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) will have the following structure for the Muslim-Jewish Relations (OPTION 1) and Persian Cultural History (OPTION 2):The dissertation provides an opportunity to learn the process of carrying out research and will help train students to be a future researcher (in academia or elsewhere). Applicants should consider carefully the formulation of a potential MPhil dissertation topic before applying. They should be in touch with members of staff who would act as supervisors before submitting the final version of their dissertation proposal.Applicants for this course are expected to have a university qualification in either Hebrew or Arabic (Muslim-Jewish Relations stream) or Persian (Persian Cultural History stream).Applicants for the PhD will be expected to have scored at least 67% or above (or the equivalent from an overseas University) in their Master's degree which should be related to the PhD programme they wish to pursue. All applicants should submit with their GRADSAF (graduate application) a workable and interesting research proposal and demonstrate that they have the required academic knowledge and skills to carry out their project.Admission is at the discretion of the Degree Committee, which judges each graduate applicant on his or her own merits and in accordance with its own set rules and regulations. For further information about this course and how to apply, please refer to the following webpage(s) on the Graduate Admissions website:http://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/amammpmei© 2017 University of Cambridge

Many world-renowned scholars of China have taught here or were trained here. The University also has world-leading research resources in Chinese Studies (e.g. archival and library holdings, collaborations with colleagues and institutions worldwide). Today Chinese Studies at Cambridge encompasses diverse disciplines and expertise, ranging from textual scholarship to fieldwork-based socio-cultural anthropology, from paleography (the study of ancient manuscripts and inscriptions) to modern literature (even 'internet literature'), from ancient history to modern history, from archaeology to linguistics, from art history to politics. We believe that the training of the next generation of China scholars is one of our most important tasks, as the rise of China and the global recognition of the importance of Chinese civilisation mean that the world will need many more experts on China in diverse disciplines, not only to research and publish on the endlessly fascinating Chinese world but also to introduce the richness of Chinese civilisation to generations of young people all over the world through university-level teaching.We offer degree courses at both the MPhil and PhD levels. We encourage you to apply to pursue a PhD in Chinese Studies with us if you already have substantial background training related to your chosen topic and can work relatively independently (but of course with constant guidance from your PhD supervisor).The MPhil Programme in Chinese Studies is a specially-designed one-year research course with substantial taught elements, aimed at training budding scholars in theories and methodologies in various fields in Chinese Studies. We welcome applications from prospective students who have taken Chinese Studies as a major subject in a first degree programme or those who already have substantial Chinese-language abilities, who had undergraduate training in other subjects (e.g. literature, history, anthropology, art history, music, archaeology, classics, politics, etc.), but who wish to consider switching to Chinese Studies for their future career (in the latter case the MPhil in Chinese Studies can serve as a so-called 'conversion course').Please browse through the Chinese Studies staff and graduate student profiles and their current research projects to find out more.Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation. This is essential especially if you are applying to the PhD programme since your proposed project has to be within the range of research expertise and interest of the supervisor. All graduate students in Chinese Studies are attached to the China Studies Research Group.

It is designed for highly-motivated future researchers who have a substantial undergraduate background in Chinese Studies or related fields but need more exposure to topic-specific or discipline-based analytical frameworks and more intense training in primary source language(s) and research skills. All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarise themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has much wider academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely. Do not feel obliged to find a topic that caters to the specific interest of potential supervisors.Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation (sometimes a staff member will be on sabbatical or research leave and cannot take on any new research student during that year). Applicants with a substantial training in the relevant skills and with a very specific research interest are advised to consult with individual staff members to explore the possibility of doing a MPhil in Chinese Studies ‘by dissertation only’. Those who do 'dissertation only' will write a longer dissertation (up to 25,000 words) and the assessment includes an oral examination of the dissertation (viva).All applications for graduate study at the University are made online via the Graduate Admissions Office (GAO). Applicants should ensure that they are familiar with the admission requirements.Please note that any applications submitted before the beginning of January, with the exception of those applying for Gates US funding, will be reviewed as a gathered field.  You will therefore not receive a decision on your application until the beginning of February.  Applications submitted after the beginning of January will be reviewed within the normal guidelines.Applicants must already have good reading skills in the Chinese language, though a student can choose to enhance his or her skills in reading and interpreting texts specific to a particular topic (more on this below). For those whose interests are in pre-modern, medieval or early China, at least two years of experience of literary Chinese (文言文) is essential.Those applicants who are not native speakers of English must have an excellent command of the English language (evidenced by the appropriate English-language test scores). If you have performed exceptionally well in your undergraduate degree (including a high GPA) you should have a decent chance of getting a scholarship to cover the cost of your MPhil studies. A number of of our past and current MPhil students have been funded by scholarships. We encourage you to explore widely various funding opportunities, including those that are based in specific countries and are for nationals of those countries (e.g. Gates US for US nationals, China Scholarship Council for Chinese nationals, Cambridge-Taiwan for Taiwanese nationals, etc.). If you are not a native speaker of English your chance of being considered for a scholarship would be greater if you had IELTS scores considerably higher than the minimum that Cambridge requires for postgraduate studies (currently 7.5 average and above 7 in all sections).Please note that if you are not a native speaker of English your chance of being offered a place in our MPhil programme would be reduced if you did not supply, upon applying, IELTS results that already satisfy the above-mentioned Cambridge postgraduate admissions requirement. So please plan well ahead and make sure that you will get the IELTS results before the particular application deadline by which you plan to apply.Here are some information on funding opportunities that are specific to the Faculty and are University-wide.Also check out The Tunku Abdul Rahman Fund (for Malaysian nationals studying in Cambridge, especially in humanities and social-science fields relating to Southeast Asia and East Asia)Once admitted into the MPhil Programme in Chinese Studies, you will have the option of following one of two streams:With the consent of your supervisors and the relevant teachers, you may combine papers from both streams.You are required to choose three papers – courses usually run over two terms – in addition to doing a 15,000-word MPhil dissertation under the supervision of a supervisor. The dissertations are submitted no later than mid-August following the start of the course.For modern and contemporary Chinese Studies, you need to choose three of the following papers:An individual student or a group of students sharing similar interests can arrange an 'Alternative Exercise'. Possible topics include:Most papers are assessed by long essays and research projects; some advanced text papers are assessed through an examination. Please note that not all papers will be available every year.Subject to approval by the Degree Committee, a student who has special needs in disciplinary or other kinds of training can use a course (paper) outside the Department or Faculty to serve as one of the option papers (called 'alternative exercise').You can find out about the details of our graduate programmes (including brief course descriptions) in our online Graduate Handbook.If you only have an intermediate-level command of Chinese and wish to improve your Chinese skills in preparation for advanced-level research, our MPhil programme can cater for that specific need. For example, one recent MPhil student who is a non-native speaker of Chinese was working on contemporary Chinese art and elected to work intensively on improving her readings skills in Chinese-language texts relating to her dissertation topic (involving meeting with her supervisor every week to translate and discuss a wide range of texts) and this constituted one of her two option papers (as a specially-arranged 'alternative exercise') (see above for the MPhil course structure and paper options). Students can also audit advanced undergraduate text-reading and liteary Chinese classes. Many other venues in Cambridge provide excellent opportunities for improving one's Chinese-language skills, e.g. the Friday text-reading seminars at the Needham Institute (primarily texts in literary Chinese), student-organised readings of Chinese classics, the Cambridge University Language Centre, language-exchange partnerships, etc.Even though your dissertation (up to 15,000 words) needs to be a piece of original research with fresh insights, it is not supposed to be a magnum opus. One should understand the process of researching and writing the MPhil dissertation as part of your training to be a future researcher (in academia or elsewhere). Applicants should consider carefully the formulation of a potential MPhil dissertation topic before applying to the programme. However, the proposed topic is not considered binding. Students work with their supervisors to fine-tune their focus or even find a different, more suitable topic.For a list of some of the past MPhil dissertation topics click here. Please note that these topics reflect not only the personal intellectual interests of the students but also the shifts over time of the research expertise of the staff members. Current graduate students and their projects.Besides the above-mentioned coursework you will have plenty of other opportunities within and beyond the Department of East Asian Studies or the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies to hone your research and other professional skills. You will have the opportunity to meet many well-known scholars who are invited to speak in our DEAS Seminar Series, the China Research Seminar Series as well as other numerous China-related events. Weekly text-reading seminars are held in the Needham Research Institute (李約瑟研究所) where scholars share their current research and the pleasure of using pre-modern Chinese texts in their work. You can also participate in the popular student-run graduate research presentations in the department. The University of Cambridge has a large number of researchers and scholars who specialise in China or have research interests in China who work in other faculties and departments (e.g. at the Needham Research Institute, the Fitzwilliam Museum, the Judge Business School, in History, Social Anthropology, Politics, History and Philosophy of Science, Architecture, Land Economy, Development Studies, Theoretical and Applied Linguistic, etc.). And every year we also host quite a few visiting scholars and PhD students from many parts of the world. These are all valuable resources for you to draw upon. Cambridge has a vibrant and welcoming Chinese Studies community and we would like to invite you to join us and the world-wide community of Chinese Studies scholars.And of course if you study with us you will be living and working alongside other intellectually-serious young people in one of the most famous and beautiful university towns in the world.Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Funding Opportunities for Postgraduate Studies at Cambridge [Link]The Needham Research Institute [Link]Reviews of Doctoral Theses Relating to China [Link]Bibliography of Western-Language Works on Chinese Popular Religion (maintained by Prof. Philip Clart of Leipzig University) [Link]British Association for Chinese Studies [Link]European Association for Chinese Studies [Link]Association for Asian Studies [Link]Bibliography of Asian Studies [Link]Great Britain China Centre [Link]Fitzwilliam Museum's Exhibition on Tomb Treasures of the Han Dynasty [Link]The British Museum's China-Related Resources [Link]China Scholarship Council [Link]The Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange [Link]Center for Chinese Studies (National Central Library of Taiwan) [Link]Chinese culture through visual materialsYou can follow 'Chinese Studies at Cambridge' on Facebook (with publicity on latest activities in Chinese Studies at Cambridge).© 2017 University of Cambridge

Many have become academics who teach all over the world, while others have pursued their interests in other equally exciting careers.Prospective applicants interested in pre-modern history should contact Professor Roel Sterckx or Dr Imre Galambos.Prospective applicants interested in modern history should contact Professor Hans van de Ven.Late Qing Policies towards the Diasporic Chinese in British Malaya (supervised by Dr Adam Chau)Prospective applicants interested in literature should contact Dr Heather Inwood.Prospective applicants interested in film, theatre and dance should contact Dr Heather Inwood.Ligne Claire: The Cross-Cultural Transmission and Transformation of Chinese Painting TechniquesProspective applicants interested in anthropology and sociology should contact Dr Adam Yuet Chau.Prospective applicants interested in linguistics should contact Dr Boping Yuan. Please note that the current Chinese Studies MPhil curriculum does not provide any concentrated training in linguistics.Although the Chinese Studies teaching staff in this department does not include economists or political scientists,  Dr Adam Yuet Chau is interested in supervising topics relating to Chinese political and economic life as it relates to broader social transformations. (This excludes topics involving technical research such as econometric or statistical analysis). [The past MPhil dissertations relating to economics reflect the fact that our department used to have an economist on the staff.] Two political scientists at the University of Cambridge are connected to our programme, Dr Kun-Chin Lin of POLIS and Dr Robert Weatherley, an affiliated lecturer in Chinese politics. Please note that even though Drs. Lin and Weatherley are available for consultation about MPhil research projects in their areas of expertise they will not be able to serve as official MPhil supervisors in FAMES.© 2017 University of Cambridge

While it was somewhat difficult adapting to a very different educational system, for the most part, I’m actually a bit surprised by how comfortable I’ve felt here. The university’s college system does an excellent job of helping both British and international graduate students to naturally establish a kind of “home base,” something which can be a bit more difficult than it would be for undergraduate students. I’ve found that my college has quickly become the centre of my social network at Cambridge. It’s been great to have the opportunity to become close with people who aren’t on my course and who are engaged in and passionate about a wide range of disciplines. As I’ve progressed in my degree, I think this has actually allowed me to bring more depth to my own academic work, broadening my objects of enquiry and modes of thinking. I have found the MPhil in Chinese Studies to be quite a challenging course, best suited for students who are self-motivated and interested in cultivating their research and analytical skills as well as improving their Chinese language abilities. I hadn’t had much exposure to anthropological theory and research methodologies during my undergraduate degree so I was quite worried about any gaps in knowledge. After finishing two terms of lectures and seminars (learning from my peers as well as my professors), however, I’ve begun to feel comfortable using a range of anthropological theories and approaches in my own written work on a variety of research topics. I’ve also been conducting interviews and doing some short-term fieldwork for the purpose of presenting a more complete ethnographic understanding of China’s young, upwardly-mobile urbanites’ daily life, habits, customs, rituals and practices.Last year I completed my MPhil in Chinese Studies and this year I began my PhD in the anthropology of Chinese religion, both in the Department of East Asian Studies.  Having studied Chinese and History at SOAS for my undergraduate degree, I was looking for a course which would be challenging and allow me to develop my research skills.  I found the MPhil Programme in Chinese Studies to be flexible and suited to those who want to use their language skills to focus on a specific area of interest, particularly in preparation for a PhD. During my MPhil, I took courses in ‘Anthropology of China’ and ‘Asia in Theory’, which provided me with a theoretical basis for my research and allowed for group discussions of key themes and concepts.  As my focus is on Chinese religion, specifically Daoism, my department arranged for me to take a special module in ‘Ritual and Religion’ to support my dissertation project.  In addition to classes with other MPhil students, I had one-on-one teaching for two hours a week with my dissertation supervisor, who is a specialist in the anthropology of Chinese religion, and this really pushed me to develop my ideas and deepen my understanding of the subject.  My supervisor also helped me to arrange language exchange with native Chinese speakers on postgraduate programmes in the department.  This has fostered a real sense of community and camaraderie in learning which I believe is vital to progress in any degree that requires intensive use of a field language. The PhD can seem a daunting prospect but with support and input from my supervisor and contemporaries, I am enjoying the process of preparing for my first year report and planning my fieldwork.  Postgraduate students have the opportunity to participate in regular seminars in order to practice presenting research and conducting question and answer sessions.  These are invaluable as they give us the chance to try out new ideas in a non-judgemental academic environment, and to discuss and defend our work amongst peers before presenting at external conferences. The department also arranges research seminars throughout the academic year, inviting an impressive range of speakers to present on a broad variety of topics. In this way we can get to know academics in our field, build networks, and discuss our research in both formal and informal settings. I have also had the opportunity to attend several external conferences and workshops, including the ‘Shifu Conference’ in Paris which focused on Chinese religion and included an array of researchers who presented on their topics and were keen to discuss with and encourage the postgraduate students.  Between the MPhil and the start of the PhD I attended a week long text-reading summer training programme which featured a range of Chinese language materials from Dunhuang manuscripts to Republican period reports.  Engaging with these different sources was exceptionally helpful practice for considering material for my own thesis.The collegiate system at Cambridge also offers many opportunities to broaden one’s interests and skills, providing a necessary counter-balance to the intense rigour of academic life.  Colleges arrange lots of events for postgraduates both socially and academically, with many hosting their own postgraduate conferences and speaker events, as well as providing pastoral support for students.  I sing with a chapel choir a couple of times a week during term-time which not only allows me to develop my musical skills and expand my knowledge of Western sacred music, but also to get to know people outside my subject area and practice discussing and explaining my research to non-specialists. This unique collegiate system creates a rich and diverse academic environment which supports us in our research and gives us opportunities to develop a wide range of supplementary skills. The MPhil programme in Chinese Studies was a rewarding and demanding year of study, and a year that I thoroughly enjoyed.The students in my MPhil cohort had all spent quite a bit of time in China, and being able to put language skills and experience of living in China to use in furthering our research interests was really intellectually stimulating. I had done a lot of Chinese language in my undergraduate degree, and really valued the opportunity to think more theoretically and structurally about the study of Chinese society.The course had a good balance between taught components and individual research, and the year is spaced out well with teaching in the first two terms, assessment essays due after Easter, and time to focus on your dissertation research after the beginning of Easter term. Apart from the papers you take, there is also the option to audit other classes. Staff in the department have a range of expertise and experience, and are both knowledgeable and demanding, pushing you to achieve your best: they won’t hold your hand and tell you exactly what to do, but they will encourage you to ask good questions, think analytically, and to apply yourself in your studies. There were certainly a few challenges – getting through substantial amounts of reading, engaging with theoretical frameworks and primary sources in Chinese, and narrowing down my research topic to make it something that could be dealt with in a 15,000-word dissertation – but with a strong sense of excitement and enjoyment during the whole course.Cambridge is an excellent place to be a student. There is a wealth of libraries, archives and electronic resources, and there are plenty of activities (academic and otherwise) going on – the difficulty is just fitting it all in! The collegiate structure is also a great advantage for graduate students. Although teaching happens in the Faculty rather than the College, your College still provides great opportunities to get involved and have a sense of community.If you have a strong interest in China, a good grounding in understanding Chinese society, and want to develop your research skills for a career either inside or outside academia, doing an MPhil in Chinese Studies at Cambridge will be an enduringly rewarding and memorable year.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Cambridge offers world-class library resources as well as academic staff who are world-recognised in the study of both modern and pre-modern China.  Our graduate students meet regularly with their supervisor/advisor and attend lectures and seminars in the Faculty and across the University. There is a weekly China Research Seminar with guest speakers from all over the world, as well as several established distinguished lecture series. These are excellent opportunities for you to meet many well-known scholars and interact with them in seminars as well as in many informal settings.Doctoral students working on topics relating to the history of science and technology in China also have the unique opportunity to work with the collections held at the Needham Research Institute (李約瑟研究所) (NRI). Students working on pre-modern topics can attend weekly seminars at the NRI, where a constant stream of visiting scholars with exciting projects share their ideas and the pleasure of using pre-modern, textual primary sources in their various fields of research. You can also participate in the popular student-run graduate research presentations in the department. The University of Cambridge has a large number of researchers and scholars who specialise in China or have research interests in China who work in other faculties and departments (e.g. the Needham Research Institute; the Fitzwilliam Museum; the Judge Business School; History; Social Anthropology; Politics; History and Philosophy of Science; Architecture; Land Economy; Development Studies; Theoretical and Applied Linguistic; etc.). And every year we host quite a few visiting scholars and PhD students from many parts of the world. These are all valuable resources for you to draw upon.During your time at Cambridge you are also likely to be involved in one or several conferences or workshops. The collegiate environment stimulates exposure to ideas and work by colleagues and fellow graduates in other disciplines. Whenever opportunities arise, we also do our best to engage our advanced doctoral candidates in undergraduate teaching and college supervisions to enable them to gain teaching experience. Our graduate community in Chinese studies is very international and friendly, and nearly all our doctoral graduates have secured postdoctoral and/or continuing academic employment.Cambridge has a vibrant and welcoming Chinese Studies community and we would like to invite you to join us and the world-wide community of Chinese Studies scholars.And of course if you study with us you will be living and working alongside other intellectually-serious young people in one of the most famous and beautiful university towns in the world.The proposed topic of research is the central element in any application, and an application is strengthened if a topic is clearly described. The application is done via the Cambridge online application platform. Amongst other application materials such as past academic transcripts, you will be asked to submit up to two pieces of writing samples. One can be a piece of significant writing from your past degree programmes (e.g. an essay or chapter from your undergraduate/master's dissertation), while the other can be a detailed PhD project proposal that includes sections on the research question, review of secondary literature, research design (how you plan to gather relevant data and how you will analyse your data) and significance of the proposed research (i.e. in what ways your research will contribute to scholarship). The Teaching Officers in Chinese welcome inquiries. Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation (sometimes a staff member will be on sabbatical or research leave and cannot take on any new research student during that year). Please note that under normal circumstances an applicant to our PhD programme must be currently engaged in a master's-level (or MPhil) academic programme or has already obtained a master's-level (or MPhil) degree.We recognise that doing a PhD is a considerable investment in time, energy and money. While occasionally individual students manage to finish in three years, the more typical scenario is four years. Because all PhD students are required to pay three years of full fees, the financial cost of doing a PhD is considerable (even more so for non-EU students). However, if you have performed exceptionally well in your undergraduate and master's degrees (i.e. high GPA) you should have a decent chance of getting a scholarship to cover most of the cost over the three to four years of PhD studies. Many of our past and current PhD students have been funded by scholarships. We encourage you to explore widely various funding opportunities, including those that are based in specific countries and are for nationals of those countries (e.g. Gates US for US nationals, China Scholarship Council for Chinese nationals, Cambridge-Taiwan for Taiwanese nationals, etc.). Some colleges at the University of Cambridge also offer graduate scholarships, though they require that you put them down as first-choice college when you apply.For applicants who are not native speakers of English their chance of being considered for a PhD place and a PhD scholarship would be enhanced if they have already met the English-proficiency requirement for postgraduate studies (currently IELTS 7.5 average and above 7 in all sections) when they submit their applications. So please plan well ahead and make sure that you will get the IELTS results before the particular application deadline by which you plan to apply.Here are some information on funding opportunities that are specific to the Faculty and are University-wide.Noteworthy:The Louis Cha Scholarship for Pre-Modern Chinese StudiesThe Tunku Abdul Rahman Fund (for Malaysian nationals studying in Cambridge, especially in humanities and social-science fields relating to Southeast Asia and East Asia)PhD scholarship offered by the Universities' China Committee in London (UCCL) The PhD degree involves writing a thesis which should not exceed 80,000 words exclusive of footnotes and bibliography. The overall word limit is 100,000 words, exclusive of bibliography. PhD students must meet a residence requirement of not less than six terms at Cambridge.A graduate student is allocated a Supervisor, with whom he or she meets regularly to discuss his or her research programme in detail. The first year of research is regarded as probationary, and at the end of it candidates take a PhD Progress Examination. This usually consists of two submissions, the first an account of the topic of research in the context of secondary scholarship relating to it, and the second an exercise in the sort of research that will ultimately form part of the PhD thesis itself. If the first year's submission is assessed as satisfactory, the Degree Committee will recommend registration for the PhD Degree.The second and third years are spent in research and writing. Graduate students also participate in the seminars and reading classes organised in the Faculty. If there are opportunities to do so, they may also help in teaching undergraduates, through the supervision system (paid on an hourly basis).  The Graduate Handbook contains detailed information on the PhD programme. Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Some recent Cambridge PhD theses have formed the bases for important books.

The department also arranges research seminars throughout the academic year, inviting an impressive range of speakers to present on a broad variety of topics. In this way we can get to know academics in our field, build networks, and discuss our research in both formal and informal settings. I have also had the opportunity to attend several external conferences and workshops, including the ‘Shifu Conference’ in Paris which focused on Chinese religion and included an array of researchers who presented on their topics and were keen to discuss with and encourage the postgraduate students.  Between the MPhil and the start of the PhD I attended a week long text-reading summer training programme which featured a range of Chinese language materials from Dunhuang manuscripts to Republican period reports.  Engaging with these different sources was exceptionally helpful practice for considering material for my own thesis.The collegiate system at Cambridge also offers many opportunities to broaden one’s interests and skills, providing a necessary counter-balance to the intense rigour of academic life.  Colleges arrange lots of events for postgraduates both socially and academically, with many hosting their own postgraduate conferences and speaker events, as well as providing pastoral support for students.  I sing with a chapel choir a couple of times a week during term-time which not only allows me to develop my musical skills and expand my knowledge of Western sacred music, but also to get to know people outside my subject area and practice discussing and explaining my research to non-specialists. This unique collegiate system creates a rich and diverse academic environment which supports us in our research and gives us opportunities to develop a wide range of supplementary skills. Deciding to return to graduate school mid-career to get my PhD was not easy because it required a great commitment of time and money, as well as long bouts away from home and family. There are so many things to consider when choosing a graduate programme: the reputation of the school, faculty, department and supervisor. Then, of course, there are the considerations of funding, training opportunities, library resources and everyday things like accommodation, meals and the local community. Finding the right place is difficult, but fortunately I have found that here in Chinese Studies at Cambridge.As a first-year graduate student in our department, the fast pace and intense coursework are challenging. Being a student of modern Chinese history, I participated in three weekly seminars on Asia in Theory, Chinese Historical Documents and War in the Making of Modern China. I capped each week by attending the China Research Seminar, where scholars from around the world come to give talks on a variety of China-related topics and then have dinner with our graduate students. I met my supervisor regularly throughout the year to discuss my own research and went to talks held by the History Faculty to learn more about the field. Most importantly, I found that our department has a very positive vibe, which buoys your spirits when you are trying to grasp new concepts or when reading and translating difficult texts. Apart from my supervisor being very supportive of my research, the other faculty members in our department are also very giving of their time, and there is good camaraderie amongst the graduate students in our Faculty. Another aspect that is nice about Cambridge is the collegiate system. Your college is more than just a dormitory—it's a small community outside of your daily work in the faculty. Most of my neighbours in college are from other disciplines, but we are all going through a PhD programme. We commune together in the buttery, gym, food hall, staircase kitchen and middle common room, or at formal dinners, club meetings or academic society events. I myself like to get my hands dirty weeding, digging, planting and picking vegetables during our gardening club work sessions. We also like to take weekend excursions to Cambridge’s city centre, which is a lovely place, or to its surrounding villages by bicycle, which is the best way to get around town. All in all, I think of my college as a home away from home.As a PhD candidate (second year onward), the pace is just as fast and the research work is equally as intense as the first year. This academic year, I am working on my dissertation topic, which is about the history of Nationalist radio in Republican China, and spend much of my time going through radio-related primary sources such as memoirs, literature, official documents, radio plays, children’s shows, operas, lectures, news, programming schedules, musical recordings, song lyrics and photographs. In addition to doing research in one of the many libraries on campus, I am receiving training as a teaching assistant in a first-year undergraduate East Asian history paper (i.e., a course) and as a supervisor to second-year undergraduates taking a paper on China and globalisation. I also am taking personal and professional development courses offered by the university as well as a Japanese course to further improve my research skills.If you were to ask me whether I would recommend the graduate programme in Chinese Studies at Cambridge, you probably already know my answer by now: it would be an unequivocal yes. I would also recommend stocking up on strong coffee and tea.I started my PhD in modern Chinese history (supported by an Arts and Humanities Research Council doctoral scholarship) at the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (FAMES) in 2012 after having read Chinese as an undergraduate here before. Making the transition from being an undergraduate to becoming a PhD student was somewhat daunting at first. While I enjoyed the new freedom to follow my interests and delve into my research on foreign banking in late 19th and early 20th century China, in the beginning I was at times not sure how to actually do a PhD. Fortunately, both the guidance of my supervisor and advisor and the courses at the University’s Researcher Development Programme quickly helped me develop a clear research plan and structure my studies in terms of what classes to attend and audit, what seminars to attend and how to prepare my first-year progress reports. The DEAS Postgraduate Seminar gave me the opportunity to start presenting my work in a friendly environment and to meet other graduate students in the faculty. Starting from the first year of my PhD, funding from the Faculty and my College also enabled me to spend several Easter and summer breaks collecting archival materials in British and German archives.During my first year, I also discussed my plans for archival work in China with my supervisor. Not only did he suggest possible sources of funding but through a partnership he had established with East China Normal University (ECNU) in Shanghai I was able to find a Chinese advisor and an affiliation with a Chinese university for the period of my archival work, which made everything much more convenient and easy to organise. Subsequently, research funding from both the German Academic Exchange Service and the partnership programme with ECNU allowed me to spend sixteen months conducting archival work in China. Spending such an extended period of time in China allowed me to visit numerous archives in China from Tianjin and Beijing in North China to Nanjing and Guangzhou in the South and unearth many hitherto unused primary sources crucial for my research. Throughout the period I spent in China, I kept in touch with my supervisor and also benefitted from the guidance of my Chinese advisor and the history faculty at ECNU. Contacts of the Faculty to the Academia Sinica in Taiwan also allowed me to spend a month collecting sources in archives in Taiwan.After my return to Cambridge, I began writing up my thesis. In the writing-up process, I again benefitted from the guidance of my supervisor and other members of faculty in East Asian Studies. Participating in the weekly China Research Seminar at FAMES, which brings many prominent scholars in Chinese Studies to the Faculty, as well as in the numerous seminars at the Faculty of History provided the ideal intellectual environment for the writing-up process. Moreover, financial support from both the Faculty and my College allowed me to present my work at national and international conferences, where I could receive useful feedback and meet with other researchers in my field. I was able to organise a panel for the annual Association for Asian Studies conference, the biggest and most important conference for Asianists. As my doctoral career is drawing to a close, both my supervisor and other faculty members at FAMES and the University’s Careers Service have provided invaluable help in preparing my job applications. In sum, FAMES has provided me with an ideal environment that proved to be both intellectually stimulating and extremely supportive throughout my PhD career.© 2017 University of Cambridge

The Faculty Library and Common Room are natural centres of activity for undergraduates and postgraduates reading Chinese Studies and other AMES subjects. The library site provides some links to useful Chinese Studies resources.Students may also use the University Library's sizeable holdings of Chinese books. The Library's Chinese collection, founded on Sir Thomas Wade's donation of his books in 1888, is recognised as one of the finest in Europe. The Library has entensive holdings in history, local and national; biography; geography; archaeology and epigraphy; law and literature. It is especially strong in holdings relating to early and premodern Chinese history; but twentieth century materials are also being built up. The Library is open-shelf, and easy access to its stacks is one of the great advantages it offers to research students.The Chinese collections comprise about 120,000 printed volumes (including bound serials) which contain over 150,000 monograph titles and over 250,000 individual titles of other (reprinted) materials such as manuscripts from Dunhuang, Huizhou, etc., archival documents and epigraphical rubbings. Over 300,000 titles are included in some 2,000 cong shu. The Chinese collection is complemented by large Japanese holdings.Cambridge is within easy reach of London and the British Library and the School of Oriental and African Studies Library.© 2017 University of Cambridge

This involvement can range from having studied the tripos to research and teaching in China-related areas.The aims of the Society are twofold. Firstly, to promote contact between Cambridge Chinese studies alumni through a combination of events (in the UK and China). Secondly, to encourage contact between alumni and current Chinese studies students, staff and researchers at Cambridge. Sir Thomas Francis Wade, GCMG, KCB (25 August 1818 to 31 July 1895) was a British diplomat and sinologist. He was the first Professor of Chinese at Cambridge and produced a syllabary in 1859 that was later amended, extended and converted into the Wade-Giles Romanisation for Mandarin Chinese by Herbert Giles in 1892.The year of the Thomas Wade Society's foundation, 2009, coincides with the University's 800th anniversary year and the 150th anniversary of Sir Thomas Wade's romanisation system for Mandarin Chinese.After a brief hiatus following the departure of the outgoing committee, The Wade Society is being rebooted for 2017. Following a short consultation with alumni, we will build a society both faithful to the founding aims and suited to its membership. The de facto General Secretary is currently Gregor McMillan (2016), who will hand over to a formal committee later in 2016. We will hold a launch event in London in Late Summer-Early Autumn 2017, and annual events thereafter.If you would like to get involved with the society, please contact Gregor, the General Secretary at gregorjmcmillan@gmail.com © 2017 University of Cambridge

Topics covered include Michel Foucault, the nation, gender, modernity, and recent developments in historiography.This Paper will be assessed by a paper of 5,000 words due at the beginning of Easter Term.A choice of several options will be offered, out of which students choose two; some of them are existing courses available for students taking either the Chinese option of the MPhil or Part II of the Oriental Studies Tripos. The precise range of options will vary from year to year. Please note that no option will be offered if fewer than two students choose to take it. These options will be assessed either by means of a three-hour examination in June or by an alternative exercise (for example, a 5,000 word essay). In 2014-2015, the following options are expected to be available:In their dissertation, students will be required to demonstrate research competence in one or more of the languages of Northeast Asia (Chinese, Japanese or Korean) and to conduct research that addresses contemporary and/or historical issues normally of relevance to two or more of the countries of East Asia (incorporating both Northeast and Southeast Asia). Students are required to submit a plan of their dissertation by the beginning of the Easter Term.The East Asian Studies course follows the existing Asian and Middle Eastern Studies MPhil rubric as set out in the general Graduate Handbook accessible to all graduate students in the Faculty:The two parts are of equal weight and shall each count for 50% of the final mark.For more information, please consult the Graduate Handbook.© 2017 University of Cambridge

In most cases, it also aims to develop students' linguistic skills as well as methodological sophistication.There are two kinds of MPhil in Japanese Studies:The Advanced Studies MPhil in Japanese Studies is a specially designed one-year research course with substantial taught elements for students who want to deepen their undergraduate education and/or prepare for a PhD in Japanese Studies. The aim is to equip students to carry out independent academic work, including training in how to use primary sources for research purposes, which lies at the heart of the programme. Our guiding principle is to ensure that each student receives the best possible education, providing a coherent course but with the flexibility to cater for individual needs.The Research MPhil in Japanese Studies allows students who already have strong research skills to focus mainly on a thesis but there is also one required researcher development seminar. For the thesis the Degree Committee, after considering the candidate's experience, qualifications and proposed subject, grants permission for the student to offer a thesis. The thesis should be on a subject approved by the Degree Committee, and has a word limit 25,000, including footnotes and appendices but excluding bibliography. In this option, an oral examination on the thesis and on the general field in which it falls will be required.Where possible, we would encourage you to discuss your particular interests with potential supervisors before applying. A summary of the research interests of the Japanese teaching staff can be found here. A more detailed list of the relevant teaching officers with their fields of expertise can also be found on the teaching staff page.For students interested in applying for admission in October 2017, a new set of Japan and the World Graduate Scholarships are now available. © 2017 University of Cambridge

        The Raven web authentication system is provided and managed by University Information Services.© 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern StudiesStudying at CambridgeThe official regulations for this course can be found here (The Japanese Studies pathway was approved in November 2015 and is thus not mentioned here): http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2013-14/weekly/6355/section4.shtml#heading2-27  In their dissertation, students will be required to demonstrate research competence using Japanese-language sources, and to conduct research that addresses contemporary and/or historical issues of relevance to Japan. Prospective students are asked to contact potential supervisors before applying to Cambridge to ensure that an appropriate supervisor is available.One-on-one supervisions will be held by the main supervisors and will take place typically at the beginning of the academic year and in the Easter term. In addition, the Researcher Development Seminar (see under 2.1) will help to guide students through the research process.Form and conduct: a dissertation of max. 15,000 words (incl. footnotes but excl. bibliography)Submission date: mid-August.  Each of the three papers (a paper is an exam for which teaching is provided) is assessed either by a research essay of maximum 5,000 words or an alternative exercise agreed by the Degree Committee and counts for one sixth of the total grade (i.e. 16.67 percent).Please note that modules offered vary according to the staff available each academic year and the interest of students, and that papers are usually only offered if there are at least two takers.Submission date of essays and alternative exercises is at the start of Easter term (check the Graduate Handbook for submission date).  This is held by all the supervisors of the MPhil pathway and external teachers, and is convened by Prof Mickey Adolphson.The Researcher Development Seminar meets throughout the first two terms, providing important skills for a successful dissertation. Students will receive training on sources and resources, library searches, academic writing, analysis and presentation skills, writing a research proposal or grant application, career planning etc., and will have opportunities to engage in peer review as they present their dissertation proposals.Form and conduct: Alternative exercise; regular participation is required.      Historical Narratives of Ancient and Medieval Japan (Mickey Adolphson)This paper offers graduate students an opportunity to critique and analyze Japanese narratives of the pre-1600 era and to work directly with primary sources. Students will initially be introduced to sources, methods, approaches and tools used by scholars in the field of pre-modern Japanese history and will subsequently read and interpret a variety of premodern Japanese sources, working towards an independent translation and analysis.Form and conduct: essay of max. 5,000 words that analyzes and contextualizes a set of sources chosen by the student. New Approaches in Early-modern Japanese Literature (Laura Moretti)This paper explores Japanese early-modern literature by taking graduate students beyond the limited canon normally discussed in literary histories to date. Students will be trained in how to access, decode, describe and analyse a wide range of primary sources in their original format. This will allow reflections on publishing genres, themes and issues in the field of early-modern Japanese literature that remain under-researched to date. The paper is taught in seminar format over two terms. The assessment takes the form of an essay where the student analyses and contextualizes a set of sources chosen by the student.Form and conduct: essay of maximum 5000 words.  [EA.1] Asia in Theory (Adam Chau, Hans van de Ven)This paper consists of weekly seminars in Michaelmas and Lent terms, each of which focuses on a particular type of theory and its relevance to the study of East Asia. Topics covered include Michel Foucault, the nation, gender, modernity and recent developments in historiography.Form and conduct: research essay of maximum 5,000 words.  [EA.4]: Topics in modern Korean history: Japanese imperialism in Korea (Michael Shin) *Not available in 2017-18*Teaching provision: 16 sessions of two hours per academic yearForm and conduct: research essay of maximum 5,000 words. Additional papers may be introduced.   Classical Japanese Texts (Laura Moretti)This is a language-based paper for which you will read a variety of pre-modern and early-modern texts, thereby providing an opportunity to explore a range of topics related, more or less directly, to pre-Meiji Japan (e.g. intralingual translation, parody, national identity, news, popular medicine, popular Buddhism, humour, visual culture, graphic prose, etc.). The topic (or topics), and consequently the choice of the primary sources, is decided in consultation with students as the aim is to accommodate individual research interests. If you are planning to write a dissertation that deals with the Meiji or pre-Meiji period, you will find this paper extremely useful as it will help you acquire the necessary skills for reading primary sources. It will also enable you to consolidate and extend your knowledge of modern Japanese as a result of extensive reading of secondary sources in Japanese on the topic(s). This paper requires previous knowledge of classical Japanese, obtained either by having taken J7 (see language options) or simply by having studied and mastered Haruo Shirane’s Classical Japanese (2005). Contemporary Japanese Society (Brigitte Steger)This is an advanced seminar-based course focusing on contemporary Japanese society. The focus will vary from year to year, and will cover issues such as learning and education, family, time, space and gender, investigating these topics from a wide range of angles. In each instance the emphasis will be on situating the study of Japan within the disciplinary context of Social Anthropology and Sociology. The course is aimed at deepening students’ understanding of selected aspects of Japanese society as well as developing research and writing skills. It will involve working with both secondary and primary source materials (in Japanese). [EA.2] The Cold War in East Asia and its Aftermath (John Nilsson-Wright, Barak Kushner)This seminar-based course employs a comparative approach. It concentrates on thematic and policy issues relevant to understanding Japan, the Korean peninsula, China (broadly defined) and Southeast Asia, as well as the role of the United States in East Asia. The course runs over two terms and draws explicitly on historical research and social science methodology in addressing how best to conceptualize ‘East Asia’ as a region. Topics addressed will vary from year to year, depending on the research interests of the teaching officers involved, but an indicative list of subjects would include some, but not necessarily all, of the following issues: the Cold War as a historical phenomenon; conflict and war in East Asia and contemporary security challenges; comparative models of economic development in East Asia and the role of ‘plan-rational’ policy-making; the role of the nation-state and competing models of historical identity; multilateralism, the emergence of trans-national actors and economic integration in East Asia; political legitimacy, contrasting models of authoritarian rule, and democratization as a political movement; demographic change; energy and environmental policy and technological change. [J.15]  Modern Japanese Cultural History (Dr Victoria Young)This seminar-style paper will explore specific facets, approaches and methodologies of modern and contemporary works of Japanese literature and culture. Topics may vary from year to year, but will generally cover a range of works that have been produced within contexts deemed ‘other’ or marginal vis-à-vis the mainstream, and will pay particular attention to issues of social, gendered, and ethnic difference that these works present. Informed by feminist, postcolonial, and translational approaches, this course aims to broaden your awareness of the kinds of texts produced in Japanese. Moreover, by drawing on key concepts and works of literary criticism, this course aims to hone your critical reading skills and enable you to engage with key questions pertaining to identity and difference in the study of a non-western literature. Supervision for all papers in group B: one short one-on-one discussion about the mini dissertation in Michaelmas term, and a one-on-one supervision in Lent term. Form and conduct: research essay of maximum 5,000 words.   J.12 Modern Japanese Texts 3 (various teachers)This paper consists of reading texts in advanced modern Japanese with attention given not only to grammar and syntax but also to context. Supplementary reading will also be expected. J.7 Literary Japanese (Laura Moretti)An introduction to the grammar of literary pre-modern Japanese, followed by readings of simple prose and poetry. Intermediate Japanese ability is required.This is an introduction to the world of pre-modern and early-modern written Japanese. We will read a variety of primary sources, beginning with the Edo period (graphic prose, humorous prose, didactic prose) and working backwards through the Muromachi period (otogizōshi), the Kamakura period (Tsurezuregusa and Hōjōki) to the Heian period (Ise monogatari and/or Genji monogatari and waka poetry). You will gain an in-depth knowledge of Japanese classical grammar that will enable you to read texts produced up to the 1910s, while developing an understanding of pre-Meiji culture and literature (both learned and popular). You will also receive instruction on translating literary texts into English and have a chance to practice translation from classical Japanese into contemporary Japanese, thus helping to improve your modern Japanese language skills.

The aim is to equip students to carry out independent academic work, including training in how to use primary sources for research purposes, which lies at the heart of the programme. Our guiding principle is to ensure that each student receives the best possible education, providing a coherent course but with the flexibility to cater for individual needs.While all students in the year group attend the Researcher Development Seminar, thereby meeting together regularly and being guided through the various steps of academic research, writing, presentation and career development, they are also free to choose two courses from a variety of options so that each student receives a tailor-made education. Approximately half of the time is allocated to individual research and the writing of a dissertation under the guidance of leading scholars. Detailed course information, including specific requirements and information on electives can be found here. We welcome applications from prospective students who have taken Japanese Studies as a major subject in a first degree programme, have acquired Japanese-language ability or have a strong interest and background in other subjects (e.g. history, anthropology, art history, music, classics, politics, international relations etc.) in the Japanese setting, or have professional experience in a Japanese and/or East Asian context.Please note the general requirements for an MPhil in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, as well as the details of the application process:http://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/applying  If you are interested in our programme, please follow the instructions on the website. We also recommend putting together an informal research proposal and contacting one of the potential supervisors by e-mail before beginning the application process: Prof Mickey Adolphson (premodern and early modern history), Dr Barak Kushner (modern history), Dr Laura Moretti (pre-modern and early modern literature), Dr John Nilsson-Wright (politics and international relations), Dr Victoria Young (modern and contemporary literature) or Dr Brigitte Steger (society). Dr Michael Shin, who teaches modern Korean history, is also available.If they wish, applicants may contact more than one academic member of staff. They will provide feedback on your project and offer advice on how to submit a formal application. They will also be able to advise you whether or not the course is right for you.The prospective supervisor will contact the applicant to discuss the research proposal by e-mail and/or by Skype.Staff list: http://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/faculty/biographies 4 January 2018 for those who want to apply for funding and want to be considered in the first round, Starting this year, the Japanese Studies section will offer full and partial Japan and the World Scholarships to offset the costs of tuition and living expenses. Applicants wishing to be considered for this scholarship should indicate so at the time of applying, but will also be expected to apply for other funding, such as from the university:https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/funding/studentshipsFor support via the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, please look into ‘Japanese Studies Scholarships’ and ‘GB Sasakawa Scholarships’:http://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/funding/faculty The final application deadline for those who do not require funding is 31 May 2018.    © 2017 University of Cambridge

For the thesis the Degree Committee, after considering the candidate's experience, qualifications and proposed subject, grants permission for the student to offer a thesis. The thesis should be on a subject approved by the Degree Committee, and has a 25,000 word limit, including footnotes and appendices but excluding bibliography. In this option, an oral examination on the thesis and on the general field in which it falls will be required.The successful applicant will be assigned a supervisor upon entry and the thesis topics and relevant training must be discussed with the supervisor as early as possible in the academic year.Where possible, we would encourage you to discuss your particular interests with potential supervisors before applying. A list of the core research areas of the teaching staff is available here. More extensive information on the relevant teaching officers with their fields of expertise can also be found on the teaching staff page.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Over the decades since Japanese Studies started at Cambridge in 1947 there has been a growing number of PhD students and many have gone on to publish their dissertations and to secure academic posts.Current students are researching topics that range from seasonal labour migration in Japan to the Shingon temple complex Kyasan in the medieval period, from political satire in 18th-century Japan to proletarian women's writing from the period of the Japanese occupation of Korea, and from Japanese foreign policy in Central Asia to the history of medicine in Japan.As a minimum requirement, if you are hoping to do PhD work at Cambridge you will need to satisfy the Faculty that you have a strong foundation in the Japanese language and a clear idea of the research you propose to undertake. The doctorate is not a taught course. The topic should be in a subject area which a member of staff can realistically supervise, but all enquiries are welcome and students are advised to write to a potential supervisor in the first instance to discuss their research proposal. Formal application is made to the Board of Graduate Studies, and the Faculty’s Degree Committee makes recommendations. Students who are accepted are assigned to one of the Cambridge colleges, which can usually provide some accommodation. Colleges also offer a place to socialize, and exchange ideas with graduate students in other disciplines.The PhD degree involves writing a thesis which should not exceed 80,000 words exclusive of footnotes and bibliography. The overall word limit is 100,000 words, exclusive of bibliography. PhD students must meet a residence requirement of no fewer than three terms at Cambridge and are expected to meet the cost of nine terms of study irrespective of where they reside. As a graduate student you are allocated a supervisor, who will meet regularly with you and monitor your progress. At the end of your first year of research you are required to submit a PhD Progress Examination. This usually consists of two long essays, one of a bibliographical nature and the other a substantial piece of work based on the first year's research. Once you have passed the PhD Progress Examination you are formally registered for the PhD degree.The second and third years are spent in research and writing. It is expected that the dissertation will be completed by the end of your third year. It should be emphasized that there is no course work at any stage: you are expected to devote your time to research in your chosen field. It is for this reason that the period of time spent acquiring a PhD at Cambridge is comparatively short. In addition to your supervisor, the various members of staff are available for conversation, exchanging ideas, and advice.© 2017 University of Cambridge

The University Library began acquiring Japanese books in 1911 and it is now one of the best research libraries for Japanese studies in Europe; as a copyright library it of course offers magnificent research facilities in almost all other fields as well.The modern Japanese collection of some 90,000 volumes is well chosen and is still expanding. Its strengths at present lie in the areas of history, religion and literature, but over the last few years strenuous efforts have been made to provide the necessary resources for modern studies in such areas as economics, modern history, society and politics. The Library subscribes to more than 300 Japanese periodicals in all areas and also to the major relevant Western-language journals.Under the Japanese Librarian, Mr Koyama, a project is now underway to provide an online computerised data-base of modern Japanese books throughout Britain, and this already provides access to the other major Japanese collections in the country.Owing to the generosity of Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance, the Library was given in 1991 a complete set of microfilms covering all 160,000 works published in the Meiji Period held in the National Diet Library in Tokyo together with state-of-the-art reader- printers. At present, this is the only set in Europe and it means that Cambridge is an ideal place at which to conduct research on all aspects of the Meiji Period.In addition, the Library contains the famous Aston Collection of some 2000 works dating from the Edo Period or before: the oldest printed items date from the Nara period and there are many rare or unique works. The collection is described in N. Hayashi & P. Kornicki, Early Japanese Books in Cambridge University Library (Cambridge U.P., 1991). Finally, the Library is also the base of the Union Catalogue of Early Japanese Books in Europe project, which is in the process of building up a data-base of all pre-1870 books throughout Europe.In addition to the University Library there is also the Faculty of Asian & Middle Eastern Studies Library which acts as a teaching library for undergraduates. It contains over 6,800 books on Japan in English and other European languages, dictionaries and basic reference books, and English-language journals. College libraries tend also to be equipped with Japanese language dictionaries and reference books.The Fitzwilliam Museum has a substantial collection of Japanese works of art as well as its own library collection.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Once a year, a prominent scholar on Korea will visit Cambridge to engage issues to which he devoted his life and to commemorate his connections with the university.Press Release [PDF]Korean newspaper article about the founding of the lectureshipNews of the most recent Kim Date Jung lecturesThe 2013 lecture was given by Professor Sohn Suk-Hee, one of the most widely respected journalists in South Korea. He is a graduate of Kookmin University in Seoul and did graduate work at the University of Minnesota. He began his career at MBC in 1984, serving as a reporter and then as a news anchor. He was the anchor of the show "100-Minute Debate" from 2002 to 2009 and has won numerous awards for his work. He teaches journalism at Sungshin Women's University and anchors a show on MBC FM radio - "Sohn Suk-Hee's Focus" - which is broadcast in the morning six days a week.The inaugural Kim Dae-Jung Memorial Lecture was given by Professor Moon Chung-in of the Department of Political Science at Yonsei University. He has published over 40 books and 230 articles in edited volumes and scholarly journals, with recent publications addressing arms control, Korean unification, and ending of the cold war in the peninsula. He served as Dean of Yonsei’s Graduate School of International Studies and taught at Williams College, University of Kentucky, Duke University, and UCSD. Professor Moon is currently a board member of the Korea Foundation, the Sejong Foundation, the East Asia Foundation, and the International Peace Foundation. He is also Editor-in-Chief of Global Asia.Often referred to as the “Nelson Mandela of Asia,” Kim Dae-Jung (1925–2009) was a democracy activist, dissident politician, and President of South Korea (1998-2003).Over the course of his decades-long struggle against the military dictatorship in South Korea, he survived an assassination attempt and was once sentenced to death. His leadership was crucial to the victory of the democracy movement in 1987, and he later became the first opposition politician to be elected President of South Korea in 1997.As President, Kim led the country through the Asian financial crisis and tried to break through decades of Cold War animosity by pursuing a policy of engagement with North Korea termed the Sunshine Policy. He went to Pyongyang for a historic summit between the two Koreas in 2000, and for his efforts to reunify and bring lasting peace to the peninsula, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.After his defeat in the presidential election of 1992, he spent several months as a visiting scholar at Clare Hall, Cambridge. He began his political comeback soon after his return to Korea and remained a devoted friend of the University until his passing. He received an honorary doctorate from the University in 2001.© 2017 University of Cambridge

She will describe North Korea’s alternate journey, and relate both to the role the United States and other powers have played – or tried to play – since the Korean War. What lessons can we draw – positive or negative – from the Korean experience about outsider efforts at nation-building, about the relationship between economic development, human rights, and democratization, about the role of security alliances and development assistance? And what does the future hold for the still-divided Korean Peninsula, and for a North Korean leadership determined to be accepted as a nuclear power?Kathleen Stephens was American ambassador to the Republic of Korea from 2008 to 2011. She first went to South Korea in the 1970s as a Peace Corps volunteer, teaching for two years in rural Korea. She returned in the 1980s as a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul covering South Korea’s tumultuous political scene. Before her nomination to be U.S. ambassador to Seoul, Stephens was Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 2005 to 2007, involved in the Six-Party Talks efforts with North Korea.Ambassador Stephens was the first Korean-speaker and first woman to hold the top U.S. job in Seoul. Her Korean-language blog was published in book form in 2010. She is the recipient of numerous awards in Korea, including the Hangul Goodwill Ambassador, Sejong Cultural Prize, Kwanghwa Diplomatic Order of Merit, and YWCA Woman Leader Special Prize. She was named the State Department’s Linguist of the Year in 2010.Stephens’ other diplomatic assignments over three decades included postings in India, China, and fracturing Yugoslavia. She was U.S. Consul General in Belfast, Northern Ireland from 1995 to 1998. In Washington, she was Director for European Affairs during the Clinton Administration, negotiator on post-conflict issues on the Balkans as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs (2003-2005), and acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs (2012).For further information, contact:Dr Matthew ShoresUniversity Lecturer in JapaneseFaculty of Asian & Middle Eastern StudiesE-mail: mws42@cam.ac.uk© 2017 University of Cambridge

Within this framework our research shows great variety from the disciplinary and geographic perspectives. Historians, anthropologists, linguists and literature specialists work alongside each other to generate a rich and diverse research environment looking at China, Japan, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.The Faculty library contains around 70,000 monograph volumes and around 180 current journals. It is primarily an English and European language collection for teaching, but it also contains numerous publications in the various Asian and Middle Eastern languages taught in the Faculty.The University Library is a legal deposit (copyright) library and has one of the largest open access collections in Europe. Acquisitions specialists complement the collection with selected purchases of overseas and foreign-language material including electronic resources. The UL also houses several major collections in all the ancient and modern Asian languages taught in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.College libraries are mainly teaching libraries. However, especially the libraries of the old Colleges often have impressive collections of books and manuscripts. © 2017 University of Cambridge

The Faculty has limited funds to offer small bursaries to enable its graduate students to attend special methodology, text-reading or foreign language courses (including travel costs). Please note that the funds cannot be used for languages taught in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies or The Language Centre. Researcher Development activity is intended to be used for transferable skills and it cannot be used for any training which is used for students to complete their current course.For further information and an application form, please contact the Secretary of the Degree Committee Dr Christine van Ruymbeke (cv223@cam.ac.uk)The majority of graduate students who study in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies are International and non-native English language speakers. The Faculty are mindful of the fact that for these students, there are different teaching methods used at their Home Institutions. It is particularly important for these students to learn how to develop their ideas in a logical, cohesive and sophisticated manner and to adopt an independent style in their research and thinking.The Faculty strongly encourage these students to attend the Academic Development and Training for International Students (ADTIS) (formly known as English for Academic Purposes (EAP)) session offered at The Language Centre before they start their course:http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/lc/adtis/adtis-index.html#There is no formal teaching training requirement required for graduate students who study within the United Kingdom. The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies understands however, that this is a concern among its graduates. The Faculty encourages its students to be proactive and speak to their supervisor and discuss any possible opportunities for teaching training in their subject area.The Language Centre has put together a web resource with tools to help with Language teaching in collaboration with the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies:http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/graduates/gradtr/index.htmlCourses offered at The Language Centre include ‘Training for Supervisors: How to Improve Students Writing’.Any research students who wish to supervise undergraduate students in the Faculty, must sign up for the 'Supervising Undergraduates: An Introduction' course which is taught by Dr Matthew Lane (Researcher Development Consultant for the School or Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences).  Please search the Training Database to find the next available session.Any research students who are interested in supervising undergraduate students must approach their supervisor in the first instance to discuss what options for gaining teaching experience are available to them.The Language Centre has compiled a web resource guide for graduate students in language-based disciplines. Please refer to their website for further details:http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/graduates/gradtr/index.htmlPilot Project: Training Workshop Organised by the Faculties of Modern and Medieval Languages and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and The Language Centre Please check The Language Centre's website to see if this will be running this academic year.http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/graduates/gradtr/index.htmlTraining for Supervisors: How to Improve your Undergraduate students WritingThis pedagogy course trains graduates and Faculty members to teach academic writing skills to the undergraduates which they supervise. The training programme will have four components:1)  An initial online module which seeks to raise awareness of what is expected of its undergraduates in their supervision essays as well as what the key features of 'good writing' are. The module will also highlight what the key difficulties are which undergraduates grapple with in their writing, especially the challenges which non-native speakers face.3)  Having completed both the online module and the workshop, the participants will be allocated mentors from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and The Language Centre who will be available to discuss any matters which they may encounter in their supervisions. Depending on the nature of the enquiry, these mentoring sessions may be conducted over the telephone, via e-mail or in person.The School of Arts and Humanities offers bursaries to both its graduate students and early career researchers towards the cost of organising workshops and conferences.For further information, please contact Dr Ben Warn at the School of Arts and Humanities E-mail: ben.warn@admin.cam.ac.ukAt the completion of their degrees, the majority of graduate students start to look for employment. Your Principal Supervisor will be able to advise you on which Researcher Development Courses to take to make you more attractive to potential employers. Supervisors are happy to look through job and grant applications and give their advice on application covering letters, application forms and CVs etc. Your supervisor and advisor (PhD students only) will be able to provide you with reference letters.There are a number of extremely useful courses offered by the University via the Cambridge University’s Skills Portal and the Human Resources Division of the University of Cambridge:http://www.skills.cam.ac.ukhttp://www.ppd.admin.cam.ac.uk/Graduate students should also check other Faculty and Department websites to see if there are career guidance or relevant opportunities there.For graduate students who are particularly interested in teaching, there is a one-year Teaching Associate Programme offered by the Higher Education Academy which is accredited:https://www.cctl.cam.ac.uk/tap There are a variety of relevant transferable skills courses which are offered by the School of Arts and Humanities, other Faculties and Departments and the University's Researcher Development Programme - PPD.

The programme offers an in-depth introduction to South Asia’s seminal textual sources, significant language skills to interpret and analyse such sources, an understanding of the relevant historiographical and theoretical issues, and methodology training. Students with an interest in Pali or Prakrit literary cultures can work on them under Dr Kahrs' guidance.The programme is appropriate for students who have already had some previous training in Sanskrit (and, where appropriate, in Pali or Prakrit). The MPhil is by dissertation only. It aims to give students an opportunity to develop their analytical, research and writing skills in preparation for further academic research or as a way to complement and enrich their interest in the Indian religious and intellectual traditions. The dissertation-only format entails working closely with one supervisor throughout the year on a dissertation to be submitted in mid-August (see below).Even though there are no taught courses, MPhil students attend a weekly graduate seminar and other reading groups with PhD students and post-doctoral researchers, thus having an opportunity to interact with their peers and seniors in a supportive environment. They may also receive training in codicology, manuscriptology, and other skills. Where relevant, they are also encouraged to attend advanced undergraduate lectures and language courses. Students can also benefit from access to Hindi language literary sources under the guidance of the Faculty's Teaching Officer in Hindi. Students are required to submit a dissertation of not more than 25,000 words (including footnotes and appendices but excluding bibliography), on a subject approved by the Degree Committee of the Faculty. Dissertations must demonstrate the student's research competence and make use of primary sources in one or more of the languages of pre-modern South Asia.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Some have chosen to apply the languages and cultural understanding gained from their BA directly to their chosen field. Others have used the analytical skills acquired from the rapid acquisition of language to other careers, including banking.Here are what some of our graduates have to say."I now work in Tokyo for an international strategy and brand consultancy, where everything I've learnt in my degree - from Japanese language to history and sociology - has helped me excel at my profession."Sven Palys, Entrepreneur"The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies offered me an extraordinary education in the complexity and diversity of Chinese language, history and culture. Studying here laid the foundations for my subsequent career researching Chinese history and literature."Julia Lovell, University Senior Lecturer, Birkbeck CollegeMore detailed individual career profiles from recent graduates are included throughout the site:© 2017 University of Cambridge

This option allows you to continue your studies in one European language through the Modern & Medieval Languages Faculty (MML), as you start learning a Middle Eastern language from scratch in FAMES.One especially popular combination is Arabic and French, which allows students to examine the colonial presence of France in North Africa and other parts of the Middle East. Exploring the puzzle of languages through their distinctive grammars and linguistic histories has led other students to continue their studies of Russian or German alongside Arabic and linguistics, for example. Many students love taking on the challenge of learning languages for their own sake."Having spent nine years studying French and Spanish, I saw university as a unique chance to try something new. Applying for an ab initio course can be quite daunting, but the Tripos is tailored to ease you into the murky world of non-Romance languages, and once you overcome the initial hurdles (new alphabet, new sounds, new grammatical concepts) it can be endlessly exciting.The major benefit of an Asian and Middle Eastern Studies degree, especially when combined with Modern and Medieval Languages (in my case Spanish), is that you can gain exposure to papers from a range of subjects and Faculties. The University may classify you as a linguist but the term is perhaps reductive, as you’ll undoubtedly end up a philosopher, historian, literary critic, translator, interpreter and even ethnographer at some point during your degree. During my four years at Cambridge I’ve taken modules in everything from Latin American cinema to Islamic travel writing, political anthropology to Portuguese modern art. As someone with wide-ranging academic interests, the course afforded me constant opportunities to explore different areas, and build on the other subjects I studied during Part IB (2nd year).When the time came to choose a Year Abroad destination I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of options - between Arabic-speaking and Spanish-speaking countries, I had a large proportion of the globe to choose from. Eventually I decided on Cairo, hailed as the cultural hub of the Middle East despite its ongoing political and civil unrest. The experience was endlessly exciting, often bizarre and certainly never dull. I managed to get an internship with the Regional Arts team of the British Council, helping facilitate projects across the 17 countries of the Middle East and North Africa, and it was a fantastic opportunity to meet passionate artists, entrepreneurs and social activists from the region. In particular I was tasked with making two documentary films, organizing three ‘Cultural Leadership and Innovation’ conferences in Dubai, Beirut and Cairo and translating a script into Arabic for a collaborative performance project with the National Theatre of Tripoli. Outside of work, life was a whirlwind of the absurd and the sublime. Cairo is a city that never stops, in fact it rarely pauses for breath, but if you approach it with a bit of gumption it can provide infinite opportunities. Over the 8 months I was there I joined an Arabic band, appeared in a KFC advert, went stargazing in the Sinai, trekked with the Bedouins, scuba-dived in Dahab, learned to train camels, worked as a journalist at the Cairo International Film Festival, founded a book group and took salsa lessons - to name but a few activities! Having feared my interests might be incompatible with Egyptian society, it ended up being one of the most interesting and eye-opening experiences I’ve ever had, and if all goes well I plan to return after graduation.The Middle East has been at the forefront of global affairs in recent years, and will undoubtedly continue to feature not only in the political sphere, but in international business and culture as well. For me, studying Arabic is a way to engage with these rapidly-changing events as they happen, and feel a part of the action on an entirely different level.""I am a second year undergraduate studying Arabic in the AMES Faculty, in combination with French in the Modern and Medieval Languages Faculty. After finding out that in combining two languages from two faculties I was setting out to "do two degrees packed into the same time as one", I felt somewhat daunted. However, this combination has allowed the diversity and broadness of study that most other Cambridge degrees could not provide. This year, for instance, I find myself in the library juggling Taha Hussein's autobiography, Al-Ayyam, French linguistics textbooks, and ethnographies of the Middle East. It is rather exciting, after a year of intensively studying the Arabic language, to be let loose on the range of papers the department of Middle Eastern Studies has to offer. Yet, I feel strongly that without having spent those many hours memorising long lists of vocabulary and the seemingly unending rules of Arabic grammar, it would impossible to study effectively, or to any level of deeper understanding, the literature, politics, history, or culture of Arab societies. This ideal is central to degrees in the Middle East Studies department, and it is something I really value. Over my first year-and-a-bit studying Arabic I have particularly enjoyed the change from school language learning, where progress was slow and the language focused towards "getting-by". Instead, in Cambridge, the process is much more rewarding, if considerably more demanding, as the majority of the basics of grammar, and a substantial amount of vocabulary, are packed into the first three 8-week terms. This meant that last summer, after studying the language only a year, I was able to travel to Jordan, along with a group of my fellow Arabists, where we were able not only to admire the tourist attractions, but indeed to visit people's homes, have conversations, go to cafes off the beaten tourist track and really engage with Jordanian social and cultural life. Such a confidence in the spoken language is the direct result of weekly classes in colloquial Arabic - the aspect of my course I have found the most challenging, but equally which will, in practice, be most useful. Certainly, as I contemplate the options for my year abroad in the Middle East, I am increasingly grateful for all that preparation!"© 2017 University of Cambridge

But East Asia as a geopolitical and cultural region is a relatively recent invention in the Western imagination (it used to be called 'the Far East', as opposed to 'the Near East' or 'the Middle East'; or 'the (Extreme) Orient'). With the rise in influence of East Asia in global affairs and the increasingly recognised importance of East Asian civilisations the demand for expertise on East Asia is on the rise. The Department of East Asian Studies (DEAS) runs two full degree courses: Chinese Studies and Japanese Studies, aiming at providing undergraduate students with solid language abilities in the chosen language as well as a deep understanding of the region through its history, politics, culture, philosophy, and literature. The skills that you obtain will open up a wide range of career options, as East Asian language skills provide a foundation for further study (in Chinese Studies, Japanese Studies or other academic or professional training programmes) and work in fields such as art and museums, the performing arts, translation, business, diplomacy, law, and journalism. Cambridge students who graduate with a strong foundation in the languages, history, and politics of these countries are well prepared to find their place in the burgeoning market in business, ideas, and cultures of East Asia. They are also well prepared to continue to advanced degrees.An essential element of the BA in Chinese or Japanese studies is the year you spend abroad in China or Japan. It is here that classroom learning comes to life, as you are given an opportunity to live amongst and communicate with native speakers. The year abroad enables you to consolidate your language skills, and to gain a deeper appreciation for the cultures and history of your chosen country.The Department of East Asian Studies holds Undergraduate Open Days in mid-March and early July each year. The Open Day provides an excellent opportunity to meet academic staff from the Department and to ask any questions that you might have about our courses.Further information about postgraduate courses at the Department may be found in our Graduate Studies section.@JapanWorldCam onTwitterJapan and the World on  Facebook© 2017 University of Cambridge

Great! Then you have no excuse to not apply!'     Sarah Eisenacher, current third-year student, 2017 Chinese is spoken by one-fifth of the world's population (though most Chinese people speak some form of dialect and learn standard mandarin and acquire literacy in Chinese in school), and more and more young people all over the world are learning Chinese. But the language is only a means towards a much more important goal, that is, to be able to access a fascinating world through the medium of its own language and conceptions. The BA in Chinese Studies at Cambridge will provide you with extensive abilities in the modern Chinese language, a solid grounding in classical and literary Chinese, and a critical understanding of the rich variety of Chinese culture. You will experience an exceptional challenge that will equip you for rewarding careers and a lifetime of appreciation of the vibrant living tradition of China and Chinese communities worldwide.Although prior knowledge of Chinese is not a prerequisite for the course, imagination, perseverance, and a sense of adventure are essential! We are looking for students who can demonstrate a serious commitment to learning about this vital, and politically and economically important, part of the world. Our curriculum caters to students learning Chinese from scratch (ab initio) as well as those who have done some substantial Chinese in secondary school (e.g. GCSE, A-level, IB, pre-U, etc.). However, this course is not suited for native speakers of Chinese.To study China, the Chinese language and Chinese culture is a tremendously fascinating challenge. The Cambridge course offers depth and breadth across many topics but it is equally true that no four-year course can cover each and every aspect or academic discipline related to China. It is important therefore that you study carefully whether our course is right for you. The Chinese Studies BA  requires a commitment to very intensive language work; alongside learning modern spoken Chinese (Mandarin) and written Chinese (in both simplified and non-simplified forms, which is why the Chinese welcoming phrase at the top of this page is in both simplified and traditional characters), the study of classical and literary forms of the Chinese language is a required component of the course in all four years. We do not teach Chinese for you to only be able to ask for directions when visiting China as a tourist, order dishes in a Chinese restaurant (though that is an important skill!), or negotiate a business deal with a Chinese company (though many of our alumni have done very well in the 'real world' of business and government). We hope that you will build the necessary foundations for a life-long engagement with, and enjoyment of, things Chinese. This course demands dedication and hard work. You need to envision yourself spending long hours (for four years!) learning and mastering the Chinese language (literary as well as modern), as well as reading and thinking about Chinese history, literature, art, anthropology, religion, philosophy, etc. Even though the course has a definitive structure, there are plenty of built-in flexibility and paper choices to allow each student to pursue his or her own inclinations (emphasising more on pre-modern or contemporary China, literature and cinema or anthropology and politics, etc.).A note on joint degrees. Many universities now offer the option of joint degrees, allowing the students to combine Chinese (usually only modern Chinese in simplified characters and up to the intermediate level) with another subject (e.g. law, business, history, politics, economics, linguistics, etc.). The increasing popularity of these joint degrees might reflect the 'hedging one's bets' and 'covering all the bases' mentality of many young people today (as well as that of their parents and career advisers), who think that 'more' must mean 'better', and that 'two' must appeal more to prospective employers than 'one'. However, we believe that an integrated Chinese Studies programme such as ours will produce graduates with genuine proficiency in the Chinese language and sophisticated understanding of China whom all prospective employers in need of China-related expertise will find attractive. Whatever other skills they might need they can easily acquire through on-the-job training.Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Here is a detailed description of the Chinese Studies course structure and study-abroad arrangement.What our current and former students are saying about our programme: student testimonials.What careers do we prepare you for: career opportunities.Details on the application process and admissions interviews.

However, there are two key differences that you should be aware of. At Cambridge, the application process starts earlier to allow time for interviews to be organised. You will also be asked to specify a College as well as naming your chosen degree subject in the application.While most of our students are UK nationals, we strongly encourage young people from other countries to also apply to us. In the past few years some of our students have hailed from Ireland and continental Europe (e.g. Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, the Netherlands) as well as farther afield (Australia and the USA).Please note that Brexit will not affect the tuition fees (during the whole course of their studies) of those EU applicants who apply for 2018 entry. [Here on tuition fees]All undergraduate admissions decisions are the responsibility of the Cambridge Colleges so check College websites for College-specific requirements (please check section below on how to choose colleges). Typical offers require: A-Level: A*AA; IB: 40-41 points, with 776 at Higher LevelNote: Chinese can be one of the three A-level subjects, but the A* can be in any of the three subjects.[We understand that some applicants might feel apprehensive about the A-Level A*AA requirement, which is a Cambridge-wide requirement, but we hope that you will work hard to make the required grades rather than turn away from a course that you really want to pursue.]Starting with the 2016 round of applications, all applicants are required to take the pre-interview written assessment for AMES at an authorised centre local to them (for a lot of applicants, this will be their school/college).Section 1 Reading Comprehension (60 minutes)Section 2 Essay/text response element (60 minutes)Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment SpecificationYou must be registered in advance (separately to your UCAS application) to take the assessment – the registration deadline for the 2018 admissions round is 15 October, 2017. Your assessment centre must register you for the pre-interview assessment; you’re not able to register yourself.The pre-interview written assessment for AMES will be taken on 2 November, 2017 (Thursday). Please check the Admissions Testing Service website for scheduled start times.Please note that your performance in the pre-interview assessment will not be considered in isolation, but will be taken into account alongside the other elements of your application. A specimen paper has been produced to allow you to sample the written assessment format and practice under timed conditions. It is not expected that you will answer every question correctly; the written assessment is designed to be challenging. Even some strong candidates may not  complete the paper in the time allowed; it is designed to distinguish across our field of high-calibre applicants.Experience with similar assessments and from trials indicates that, on average, typical applicants to the most highly selective undergraduate courses (who are by definition academically very able) will gain approximately half of the available marks. The best applicants will score more highly, but only relatively few are expected to gain more than 80% of the available marks.Written assessments help admissions tutors to assess whether candidates have the skills, aptitudes and any required subject knowledge and understanding required to study the relevant course at Cambridge. They are only one of the elements used in the admissions process. Others include a candidate’s academic record and forecast grades in school-leaving examinations; UCAS application form; examples of recent written work submitted to the College to which they are applying; and performance at interview, if invited to attend.Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Text BookletAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Answer SheetAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Answer KeyAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Explained AnswersAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 2More information on admissions requirements can be found here.In your College you will have a Director of Studies who will be responsible for your academic welfare and for your progress. In most other subjects your Director of Studies also arranges your supervisions, but in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies supervisions are arranged by your teachers in the Faculty.Students choosing Chinese Studies and wondering which College to apply to should be aware that members of the Chinese Studies academic staff are Fellows of the following Colleges. In most cases they act as Director of Studies (DoS) for all students in their Colleges doing Chinese Studies as well as other subjects within Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. In other colleges your Director of Studies is likely to be a specialist in Middle Eastern Studies, Japanese or South Asian Studies. Having a Chinese Studies DoS in your own college would mean that you will have much readier access to help and advice if needed.In addition to talking to you about your personal statement, interviewers will want to know why you want to study the language and culture on which you will be spending the next four years of your life (and even beyond Cambridge). Before your interview you will need to do some exploratory reading about China and to be prepared to talk about your reading in the interview. This can include general history, literature in translation and other reading that relates to your main interest in China. Wikipedia (which is not always a trustworthy source) and other internet sources alone are not good enough, though they can often serve as convenient entry points to more proper and scholarly sources.You will find some reading recommendations in our section on 'Preparatory Reading'. You will impress the interviewers positively if you can demonstrate your commitment to pursuing Chinese Studies by having done some relevant readings and having watched some Chinese films.Each applicant will have two interview sessions, each lasting approximately 25-30 minutes. The 'general interview' is often conducted by the College admissions tutor and another Fellow of the College, both of whom are most likely non-China specialists. This interview's aim is to assess the applicant's general academic and intellectual aptitudes. The 'subject interview' is usually conducted by two members of the Chinese Studies staff, one of whom can be the Director of Studies for AMES subjects for the College. This interview's aim is to assess the applicant's suitability for the Chinese Studies course. The interviewers will write up reports on the interviews that will serve as an important basis for the admissions decisions at the College to which the applicant has applied and/or at the admissions pool in the event that the applicant is considered suitable for the course but the College in question does not have enough space for the applicant. All highly-qualified and suitable applicants will have a fair chance of getting admitted no matter which college they have applied to (though we suggest you consider first and foremost those colleges with Chinese Studies staff members as fellows and/or directors of studies for AMES subjects).No one should be intimidated by the interview. There are many resources to help you familiarise yourself with the interview process.

Some have joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, or international scientific or welfare agencies. Others have entered large business concerns based in London or in East Asia. Some of our graduates have become journalists, widely read for their reports on current events in the People's Republic of China. Others have become teachers in Britain, North America, Hong Kong, Japan and Europe. Still others have joined the staffs of major museums and libraries. One even runs a successful travel agency specialising in China tours.Very few graduates have set aside Chinese to take up work unrelated to China; they have preferred instead to employ the skills learned in the Cambridge course for distinctive and highly rewarding careers. Studying Chinese at Cambridge is not only fascinating, but it also helps you develop an invaluable set of skills. The rigorous course, the broad range of subjects covered and the opportunity to immerse yourself in a different culture really do make a unique and rewarding experience.Small classes mean a greater sense of community and support - both classmates and staff encouraged me to achieve the most I could from my studies. In particular, I co-wrote and published an academic article [article here] with my dissertation supervisor – something I never thought I would be doing as an undergraduate!Every day I use what I have learned at Cambridge in my work. At the UK Department for International Development, I depend upon the analytical skills and ability to quickly understand new topics that I gained from AMES. Within the Department I work in the trade policy team, looking into how international trade can benefit developing countries. In this work an understanding of China, the world’s second largest economy, has proven invaluable and I firmly believe these skills will continue to support me in my future career. "I chose Chinese Studies because I love a challenge, and relished the idea of a course that provided such a rich insight into an extraordinary country. I studied a mix of disciplines at A-level (Ancient Greek, Maths, History and Politics), so the breadth of the course also appealed to me. My time in the Faculty was everything I'd hoped for and more. By the time I reached my third year, which is when I spent six months at Beijing University, the focus of my interest was international relations. I decided to write my dissertation on Chinese-African relations, and after some persistent cold-calls and emails, I landed an internship in the political section of the European Commissions Delegation in Beijing that summer.My time at the Delegation led me to realise that I would be better suited to work in a business with commercially-driven goals, and so during my final year (in 2008) I sought a training contract with an international law firm that had shown a particular focus on China. I loved my two years there, particularly the six months I spent in the firm's Hong Kong office, but at the end of the two years I realised that none of the departments quite felt like the right fit for me. Fate then played a wonderfully-timed hand, and I received a call from a US singer's manager who had often seen me at gigs in previous years. He asked me if I wanted to be a music lawyer. Ive now been a music lawyer for over a year in a niche law firm and am loving every minute, looking forward to the moment when we can fully realise the potential of the music market in China.""Having graduated in 1997 with a joint BA in Chinese and History, I went on to complete an MPhil and PhD in modern Chinese literature at the Faculty in Cambridge, and studied also at the Johns Hopkins Center for Chinese Studies in Nanjing and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. I am now Senior Lecturer in Modern Chinese History at Birkbeck College, University of London. Since graduating, I have published three books on the links between modern Chinese culture and national identity. I have also translated several works of modern Chinese fiction into English, including the complete short stories of Lu Xun for Penguin Classics.The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies offered me an extraordinary education in the complexity and diversity of Chinese language, history and culture. Studying here laid the foundations for my subsequent career researching Chinese history and literature. The training that I received here provided me with linguistic and intellectual resources upon which I continue to draw today."© 2017 University of Cambridge

The course is taught by scholars and teachers who are actively engaged in research and publication and by native speakers of Chinese. Its overall aim is to train undergraduates in both the modern and pre-modern forms of Chinese, and to give them a well-informed understanding of China through learning its language, literature, religions, history, society and politics. The course gives students an understanding of both traditional and modern Chinese society and how China’s past has informed, and continues to impact, much of its present, and provides students with a skill set that enables them to analyse China through its own language(s) and sources. The course has five main components and aims to obtain the following learning outcomes:                        The Chinese language is taught from scratch at Cambridge, so the course requires no prior knowledge of the language. A GCSE or A-level in Chinese may give some indication of your motivation and commitment to the subject, but it is by no means a requirement. The course comprises a wide range of cultural, historical, and literary papers that require analytical skills beyond basic language training.For those applicants doing A-level, Chinese can be one of the three A-level subjects, and the A* can be in any of the three subjects. Once offered a place in our programme (normally sometime in January of the year of matriculation), it is important for you to do some exploratory reading about China, which will make it much easier for you to assimilate the enormous amount of information with which you will be presented in your first year (and you will soon find out that the efficacy of your language-learning is very much heightened by your knowledge about Chinese history, society and culture).What if you have performed well in A-level Chinese or have taken quite a bit of Chinese before coming to Cambridge (especially since many secondary schools now offer courses on Chinese as a foreign language)? On very rare occasions, we have tested the student’s Chinese abilities and decided that she or he could begin with second-year Chinese (Part IB). However, in most cases of students with some substantial prior exposure to Chinese (still a minority amongst our students but increasingly common) they will still begin with the first-year course (Part IA) and find it challenging and interesting. This is because there are so many other components in the first-year course in addition to modern Chinese. They will do the East Asia history survey paper (EAS1) that involves reading (lots of reading!), lectures, essay-writing, seminar discussions and supervisions; they will begin learning classical/literary Chinese in the Lent term (i.e. the second term); they will have to learn how to recognise and write in both simplified and non-simplified (i.e. traditional) characters. Even in modern Chinese learning they will find their advantage over those starting from scratch quickly disappearing in the first year because of the quick pace of the language course. Another scenario could be that such students can skip some of the first-year modern Chinese language papers (C1, C2 and C3) but will be challenged and kept busy by alternative language training, special supervisions and projects all the while taking the other essential first-year papers (East Asian History and Literary Chinese). Please note that the BA in Chinese Studies is not suitable for native speakers of Chinese.You are advised to put only one subject (i.e. Chinese Studies) on your application form. You cannot combine Chinese Studies with Japanese Studies (because such a combination is only considered under special circumstances) or with any MML subjects.The course is four years in duration, and is divided into two parts. Part I, lasting two years, will provide you with a thorough grounding in reading, writing and speaking modern standard Chinese (putonghua), in reading literary and classical Chinese, and in Chinese and East Asian history from ancient to modern times. In Part II, you spend your third year in China. In your final year, you continue with intensive language work in both modern and literary Chinese and concentrate on a special subject (contemporary society, modern literature and film, modern history, dynastic China, linguistics, politics). You will also work on a 12,000-word dissertation on a topic of your choice.One of the distinctive strengths of Cambridge teaching is the supervision system, in which you have the opportunity to test out your ideas with a member of academic staff. We see this as a critical part of the pedagogical process, and expect you to participate in a genuine dialogue in which you should feel free to challenge us as much as we, inevitably, will challenge you. In the first year you will have supervisions for language and for history, usually in pairs or small groups. Unlike larger subjects that are well represented in the colleges, we arrange supervisions centrally through the Faculty to ensure that all students reading Chinese Studies receive an equal amount of attention, regardless of what college they are in.During your first year, the main part of your time will be spent learning modern Chinese. You will have covered its basic grammar and have acquired a substantial active and passive vocabulary. You will also receive an introduction to East Asian history, from antiquity to the present, with break-out sessions zooming in on topics specific to China. This course is taken by all students studying Chinese and Japanese. In addition you will start learning literary Chinese through reading classical texts from the pre-imperial and early imperial period, mainly (but not exclusively) focused on philosophy. In addition, you will prepare for an examination in spoken Chinese. The following are the compulsory language papers: Modern Chinese Translation and Writing 1, Modern Chinese Texts 1, and Literary Chinese 1.You may expect to receive around seventeen hours of teaching per week at the Faculty, in the form of lectures, seminars, and supervisions.During the second year, your intensive training in modern Chinese will allow you to start tackling original material (so-called ‘authentic texts’), including extracts from novels, newspapers, and other forms of literary production. You will have the opportunity to delve more deeply into Chinese history through a paper in pre-modern and modern history (one of which is compulsory, though both can be taken).  In literary Chinese you will learn to read traditional Chinese poetry, and have a taste of fiction and historical writing from dynastic China. There is also provision for you to choose from a number of other content courses.You will take the following compulsory modules: Modern Chinese Translation and Writing 2, Modern Chinese Texts 2, Literary Chinese 2; plus two of the following: History of Dynastic China*, Globalisation in China, 1850 to present*, Japanese History, Japanese Literary Modernity, Japanese Society, Japanese Politics, Cinema East, Structure and Meanings (from the Modern and Medieval Languages Tripos) (* Denotes papers where at least one must be chosen).You may expect to receive up to fifteen hours of teaching per week at the Faculty during your second year.Please note that, while core papers will always be available, the Faculty reserves the right to suspend any elective paper in a given academic year.You will be required to spend at least eight months in China during your third year, attending courses at either Peking University in Beijing or the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.The object of the year abroad is to increase fluency and understanding of the language, and to provide the opportunity to start work on a dissertation, which must show evidence of a substantial use of Chinese language sources, whether oral or textual.When you return from China for your fourth year, you will have a core curriculum in both modern and literary Chinese, and a number of special subject options. These options reflect the expertise of the teaching staff, and they give students an opportunity to study a particular period or subject within Chinese Studies in a far more focused manner. Options available include papers on modern literature, modern history, dynastic China, China’s role in the international order, contemporary society, and language and linguistics. Note that not all options will be available in a given academic year but you will always have a choice of a minimum of three. A dissertation of 12,000 words is also a requirement, giving the students the opportunity to engage in original research and the challenge to produce a substantial piece of scholarship (individually supervised by a dissertation supervisor). Dissertations can (but need not) be connected with one’s special subject paper, or they can simply be on a topic of interest not covered in depth elsewhere.You may expect to receive up to twelve hours of teaching per week at the Faculty during your fourth year. There will also be supervision meetings with your supervisor on your dissertation research.The Chinese Studies course is demanding and intensive. Given the nature of the Chinese language, it requires a strong commitment to continuous, and often time-consuming, language work that includes a substantial amount of memorisation. You should expect having to work a minimum of 20 to 25 hours per week outside your classes, lectures, and supervisions. But think of the pleasure and satisfaction that come with, and after, the hard work!According to existing faculty regulations, it is possible to combine Japanese with Chinese Studies at Cambridge (but only in exceptional circumstances and with permission of the Faculty Board). Chinese is already a very challenging language, and we would prefer our students achieve a high level of Chinese proficiency (vernacular and literary) as well as adequate exposure to Chinese history, culture and society rather than graduating with only an intermediate-level competence.If you decide to combine Japanese with Chinese Studies, you will have to forego your study-abroad experience in China in the third year and do introductory Japanese in Cambridge. Not spending a year in China and spending most of your third year studying Japanese (which is also a very difficult language) would inevitably mean that your Chinese proficiency will suffer, and you will also miss out on personally experiencing Chinese society and culture in an intimate and sustained manner. [Since some of the students leave for China in early July and come back to the UK in late September the next year they can be spending as many as 15 months in China, which often include extensive travels in the country and/or volunteering in NGOs and doing internships.] If you combine Japanese with Chinese Studies you will also be deprived of the pleasure and challenge of researching and writing the undergraduate dissertation on a topic of your choice.You are advised to put only one subject (i.e. Chinese Studies) on your application form. Though we would of course encourage our students to pursue the study of other languages and cultures in their spare time, we strongly believe a dedicated and focused approach to Chinese Studies will yield the best outcome. Please note that currently Japanese is the only language that can be combined with Chinese Studies according to existing regulations. You are not able to study Korean as an option (Japanese Studies students have the option to study introductory Korean because Japanese and Korean are grammatically cognate languages).© 2017 University of Cambridge

Great! Then you have no excuse to not apply!'     Sarah Eisenacher, current third-year student, 2017 Chinese is spoken by one-fifth of the world's population (though most Chinese people speak some form of dialect and learn standard mandarin and acquire literacy in Chinese in school), and more and more young people all over the world are learning Chinese. But the language is only a means towards a much more important goal, that is, to be able to access a fascinating world through the medium of its own language and conceptions. The BA in Chinese Studies at Cambridge will provide you with extensive abilities in the modern Chinese language, a solid grounding in classical and literary Chinese, and a critical understanding of the rich variety of Chinese culture. You will experience an exceptional challenge that will equip you for rewarding careers and a lifetime of appreciation of the vibrant living tradition of China and Chinese communities worldwide.Although prior knowledge of Chinese is not a prerequisite for the course, imagination, perseverance, and a sense of adventure are essential! We are looking for students who can demonstrate a serious commitment to learning about this vital, and politically and economically important, part of the world. Our curriculum caters to students learning Chinese from scratch (ab initio) as well as those who have done some substantial Chinese in secondary school (e.g. GCSE, A-level, IB, pre-U, etc.). However, this course is not suited for native speakers of Chinese.To study China, the Chinese language and Chinese culture is a tremendously fascinating challenge. The Cambridge course offers depth and breadth across many topics but it is equally true that no four-year course can cover each and every aspect or academic discipline related to China. It is important therefore that you study carefully whether our course is right for you. The Chinese Studies BA  requires a commitment to very intensive language work; alongside learning modern spoken Chinese (Mandarin) and written Chinese (in both simplified and non-simplified forms, which is why the Chinese welcoming phrase at the top of this page is in both simplified and traditional characters), the study of classical and literary forms of the Chinese language is a required component of the course in all four years. We do not teach Chinese for you to only be able to ask for directions when visiting China as a tourist, order dishes in a Chinese restaurant (though that is an important skill!), or negotiate a business deal with a Chinese company (though many of our alumni have done very well in the 'real world' of business and government). We hope that you will build the necessary foundations for a life-long engagement with, and enjoyment of, things Chinese. This course demands dedication and hard work. You need to envision yourself spending long hours (for four years!) learning and mastering the Chinese language (literary as well as modern), as well as reading and thinking about Chinese history, literature, art, anthropology, religion, philosophy, etc. Even though the course has a definitive structure, there are plenty of built-in flexibility and paper choices to allow each student to pursue his or her own inclinations (emphasising more on pre-modern or contemporary China, literature and cinema or anthropology and politics, etc.).A note on joint degrees. Many universities now offer the option of joint degrees, allowing the students to combine Chinese (usually only modern Chinese in simplified characters and up to the intermediate level) with another subject (e.g. law, business, history, politics, economics, linguistics, etc.). The increasing popularity of these joint degrees might reflect the 'hedging one's bets' and 'covering all the bases' mentality of many young people today (as well as that of their parents and career advisers), who think that 'more' must mean 'better', and that 'two' must appeal more to prospective employers than 'one'. However, we believe that an integrated Chinese Studies programme such as ours will produce graduates with genuine proficiency in the Chinese language and sophisticated understanding of China whom all prospective employers in need of China-related expertise will find attractive. Whatever other skills they might need they can easily acquire through on-the-job training.Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Here is a detailed description of the Chinese Studies course structure and study-abroad arrangement.What our current and former students are saying about our programme: student testimonials.What careers do we prepare you for: career opportunities.Details on the application process and admissions interviews.

Literary Chinese was the main language of written communication across East Asia from antiquity until the early twentieth century. ‘Classical’ Chinese strictly speaking refers to the language of the Chinese Classics but you will hear students and teachers often refer to all formal ways of writing in Chinese prior to the early 20th century as ‘classical’. (In China it is referred to as gudai hanyu 古代漢語 ‘ancient/pre-modern Chinese’). Literary Chinese was the principal vehicle of culture in China and East Asia for many centuries. It was the ‘lingua franca’ (a universal literary and administrative language) among the educated classes. Its impact and reach therefore can be compared to that of Latin and French during large parts of European history or indeed English today. The ability to write and read texts written in literary Chinese continues to be a defining feature of the educated person in Chinese societies.Note that wenyan is not fundamentally spoken, albeit that reciting, memorising and quoting from famous texts was, and still is, common practice. Modern Mandarin, in both spoken and written form, is peppered with a vast amount of vocabulary, proverbs, analogies and anecdotal references borrowed from literary Chinese. At least from our modern point of view today, literary Chinese is a language that is primarily to be seen and read and not be heard (with poetry as a possible exception). Therefore spoken Mandarin and literary Chinese are two different linguistic media, and it is essential to master both in order to plumb below the surface level of your encounter with Chinese civilisation. Literary Chinese is much more than a simplified or ‘essential’ transcription of speech. In fact you will find that you will be able to read about topics, ideas, and themes in the literary language much earlier and at a more advanced level than you will be able to do in Modern Mandarin.  At Cambridge we teach literary Chinese as a required part of the core curriculum in each of the four years you spend with us (including the year abroad). In the first year, after you have had a term of intensive modern Mandarin, we start with excerpts from China’s most famous philosophers from the classical period (including thinkers such as Confucius 孔子, Mencius 孟子, and Zhuangzi 莊子). We add to these stories and anecdotes from the same period, as they provide the best way into the basic grammar of how the language works. With the philosophers under the belt, you will then learn how to read traditional Chinese poetry in the second year with highlights from the Han 漢 and Tang 唐 periods. You will also learn in your second year to read ‘fiction’ in literary Chinese, ranging from medieval tales of the fantastic to a late imperial diary, and indeed, a spot of Sherlock Holmes! You will continue honing your literary-Chinese skills while doing the year-abroad in China, covering a range of texts including chapters from the most famous novels of the Ming 明 and Qing 清 dynasties (e.g. 紅樓夢 The Dream of the Red Chamber). In the fourth year, when you return from your year abroad, you will have all tools to tackle a selection of writings that represent the incredibly vast corpus of genres in the literary language that China has produced. On the menu will be a selection that includes passages from a medical treatise, Buddhist stories, a military treatise, Song dynasty literary genres and travel literature.Classes in literary Chinese combine language learning and an engagement with the content and context in which the texts were produced. We read authentic texts in the original language but also talk about their historical and social background. Thus literary Chinese classes are just as much about the language as about traditional Chinese culture and society.  Literary Chinese is by no means a ‘dead’ language (like Latin or ancient Greek). Despite attempts by the New Culture Movement during the May Fourth period (ca. 1915-1921) to abolish its official use in favour of a more vernacular Chinese, the literary language continues to permeate the Chinese language and Chinese culture at large. In fact, as we speak, China is witnessing the most rigorous revival in its own pre-modern tradition and in contrast with the previous decades this tradition is now a source of national pride and increasingly part of modern cultural identity. In short, literary Chinese has left and continues to leave a DNA imprint on Chinese culture at various levels. Modern Mandarin is replete with idioms, allusions, and analogies that derive from traditional culture written in wenyan. Chinese art and calligraphy are only the most obvious media where literary Chinese continues to be used on a daily basis, but classical references—often cited directly in the original language—are often used in speeches delivered by diplomats, politicians and other public figures.  While not all university courses in Chinese Studies expose students to literary Chinese, most full-time Chinese Studies programs in the UK and Europe will train students in literary Chinese as part of their regular curriculum. At Cambridge we believe that training in literary Chinese is as essential to the aspiring China specialist as calculus is to a mathematician, Shakespeare to a student of English, or anatomy to a student of medicine. Literary Chinese permeates every aspect of traditional Chinese culture, as well as the modern language. Without it, not only would you not be able to read any document produced prior to the early 20th century but, even more importantly, you would not be able to detect its impact on literary and everyday expressions today. Whether you are interested in literature, art, poetry, linguistics, history, law, philosophy or simply wish to read newspapers, decipher traffic signs and restaurant menus, party slogans, TV subtitles or advertising billboards,  you will need literary Chinese.By learning wenyan you will have the linguistic tools necessary to connect with the past and appreciate the richness of the written tradition that to a large extent defines modern Chinese identity. Even when speaking or reading modern Chinese, you will be able to recognise allusions and references that otherwise would remain hidden from you, and to detect the subtleties of irony, humour or sarcasm they meant to convey. By studying literary Chinese, you will enable yourself to understand modern Chinese speech or writing at a deeper level, and you will get a proper feel of how to write in Chinese beyond reproducing colloquial Chinese.The past is never completely gone. It lives on as a cultural tradition that determines the identity of a people today. Language is part of this tradition and is thus an essential component of modern culture. This is especially the case in Chinese where written sources from former time periods have been the backbone of literary education for the past two millennia and continue to be so today as soon as children begin learning to read and write.  On a most immediate level, learning literary Chinese will enable you to engage with an extremely diverse range of material, including administrative documents, historiographical works, religious scriptures, novels and other literary genres, letters, medical and divination treatises, books on military strategy, personal diaries, official correspondence, gazetteers and early newspapers. The ability to read the language gives you access to a vast body of sources, only a fraction of which is available in translation (in modern Chinese or Western languages).On a daily level, you will be able to fully understand historical films and novels which increasingly rely on literary Chinese to convey a sense of historical authenticity and to connect with the elite culture of the past. You will notice the implicit connections with the past and understand what is implied by those connections. When learning quotes and proverbs commonly used in modern speech, you will be able to understand what they mean exactly, rather than having to memorise random strings of syllables.In sum, learning literary Chinese is an essential tool for tapping into deeper layers of Chinese culture and is simply indispensable for a thorough understanding of China, regardless of whether you are studying pre-modern or modern China, or whether you are interested in the future transformations of this ever-changing yet resolutely tradition-minded civilisation!  © 2017 University of Cambridge

Although competence in communication in a language involves more than just linguistic competence, linguistic competence is nevertheless an essential element in communicative competence. As our students are learning Chinese in an English-speaking environment, it is difficult for them to acquire the grammatical rules intuitively. With this in mind, we adopt a proportional approach in designing our Modern Chinese Programme.In the 1st year, we put more emphasis on linguistic forms (e.g. grammar, lexicon, etc.) in order to provide our students with basic tools for using the Chinese language. This emphasis on linguistic forms gradually decreases in later years as non-formal components (e.g. functions, themes, etc.) are given correspondingly more prominence. The 1st year is treated as a transitional stage between language learning in secondary schools, where vocabulary and structure lists are provided, and language learning at the university level, where the aim is to train the student to become an independent user of the language. Although grammar instruction is still provided after the 1st year, the teaching focus will be more on the use, rather than the grammatical rules, of the language. Language materials used in the 1st year are simplified for pedagogical purposes, but authentic materials are gradually introduced afterwards.Our Modern Chinese Programme aims at providing students with all the communicative skills necessary for them to function in Chinese-speaking communities, which include listening, speaking, reading, writing, translating and interpreting. It is recognised that students may have various professions and occupations in mind for their future career and may wish to learn business Chinese, Chinese for diplomacy, etc. which may not be taught specifically in our Modern Chinese Programme. However, we believe that a solid foundation in common-core Chinese is essential for students to pursue their future study of Chinese. It gives them an advanced proficiency in the language that is transferable to any specific field of language use or professional walk of life.We believe that the spontaneous use of language derives from subconscious or implicit knowledge, while conscious or explicit knowledge comes into play in situations where the focus is on form rather than meaning. Explicit knowledge here refers to the technical aspects of language, such as grammar, but we want to get students beyond the stage of reliance on explicit knowledge and promote their capacity for implicit knowledge. A consequence of this view is that activities designed to promote fluency should involve an emphasis on meaning. Drills are considered useful exercises in classroom teaching, particularly at early stages, but students benefit from an increasing number of activities designed to encourage creative and independent language use as they move to more advanced stages. These activities have the effect of (a) maximising opportunities for use; (b) creating a more natural environment; (c) simulating natural language settings and promoting the development of language-use strategies; (d) enabling students to convert what they have learned consciously into the subconscious knowledge which supports the spontaneous use of the language.Learning Chinese to an advanced level requires a huge commitment and investment in time on a daily basis. The proficiency we aim to achieve at Cambridge goes far beyond the utilitarian day-to-day use of Chinese one might wish to pick up to travel or to order a meal.  Students are required to commit to an amount of language work that will far exceed what they may have been used to in learning foreign languages in secondary schools. Likewise, once students have passed the initial stages, being able to look up and master vocabulary independently is an indispensable skill for anyone aspiring to be an expert user of Chinese. Do expect, therefore, to be working on your Chinese several hours each day inside and outside the classroom. In return, you will gain not only a linguistic and communicative proficiency that sets you up for life and is admired by your future employers, but, most importantly, you will learn to speak and ‘think’ Chinese and understand this fascinating culture and part of the world ‘from within’.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Although the study of non-Western cultures is still considered somewhat of a novelty amongst people in the UK, I can wholeheartedly say I have no regrets about the decision I made. Rather, I would urge more people to pursue the study of this fascinating and important country and embark on a truly unique path in life, full of adventures.The Cambridge course aims for you to reach an advanced proficiency in Modern Chinese by the end of the degree, which means the pace of learning is quick and intense. Learning to speak and write Chinese is by no means a small feat, but the sense of achievement is just as great. The small class sizes (typically no larger than 10 people) and supportive, high-quality teaching means your Chinese comes on in leaps and bounds term by term. I am really looking forward to reaping the rewards of my studies thus far during my upcoming year abroad in Beijing. The study of Classical Chinese alongside this deepens your intuitive understanding of the language as well as opening up the pleasures of reading pre-modern philosophy, prose and poetry in its original form.The course also allows you to study various aspects of East Asian culture alongside intensive language work. Over the last two years, I have covered topics ranging from post-war Korean cinema, to Heian Japan and even China's reaction to Brexit. The freedom to study many different academic fields under one degree is very exciting and the faculty will support you in pursuing whatever academic interest you may have. The small size of the faculty means you end up building very close relationships with your classmates and professors.Cambridge is a beautiful and comfortable city to live in, full of many interesting and ambitious people. The student community is really buzzing and there are so many things you can get involved with! Alongside my studies, I have found the time to help organise an international student film festival, take Spanish classes and keep up old interests in running and yoga. Whatever your interests, you are bound to find a society that suits you." Alexander Johnstone (2017, in his second year) "I had already had some experience with China before I joined AMES in October 2015. Particularly my gap year at a university in Hangzhou (a city you definitely need to visit if you haven’t yet) had equipped me with a fairly broad knowledge of not only the Chinese language but also Chinese society, history, and politics. Knowing some things is often, though arguably not always, useful. But don’t worry if at this point you can’t memorise the dates of all dynasties or every 5-year plan since 1953. Rather than amassing facts, I recommend that you use the time between now and the potential start of your degree to explore a wide variety of material on or from China. See how you like Chinese silent films from the 1930s, Little Apple from the Chopstick Brothers, or calligraphy from the Song Dynasty. If you can, spend some time in China (there are lots of funding opportunities through various bodies of the Chinese government), or pay a visit to museums exhibiting communist propaganda posters from the Cultural Revolution or other forms of high art. The point is: find out whether you can develop an interest in some aspect of China and its tradition that can keep you motivated throughout four years of intensive study. You have already come to the conclusion that nothing is more fun than immersing yourself with ‘things Chinese’? Great! Then you have no excuse to not apply!"                                                                                                                           Sarah Eisenacher (2017, in her second year) "I applied to study Chinese without any experience in the language, just French and Italian at A level and an interest in China. While some of my classmates had studied Chinese before (and if you have, go for it), most differences had evened out by end of first term. If like me you haven’t been able to study Chinese, Japanese, Arabic or Persian before, don’t worry. The course is designed for beginners and starting from scratch won’t hold you back."Aron White (2013) "The staff of the Department of East Asian Studies are inspiring and often very witty as well. Many of them are also well-known academics, so you're learning from some of the most knowledgeable people in the field. The faculty staff have always been very approachable and friendly in my experience, and none of us could have come so far without their help. I think it's also important to point out that the courses in the Department of East Asian Studies very much focus on independent learning, and what you do and how far you go is always up to you as a student."Hugh Grigg (2013)  "I don't remember exactly why I chose to study Chinese, but I like to tell people it's because I wanted to earwig at bus stops. The language is a fantastic challenge, but it's the way this is linked to history and culture which makes studying China quite so rewarding. AMES at Cambridge is a course that grounds you very thoroughly in every aspect of language, history and culture. To achieve this, the pace is intense from day one. I have mornings of classes and spend the afternoon reading, preparing or otherwise pouring over the many characters we are given to learn each week."Greg McMillan wrote this when he was a second-year student in 2013 "The highlight of my time at Cambridge was the second half of my degree - studying abroad at Peking University and doing Part II back at Cambridge. After two hard years of learning characters and getting the basics, I learnt how to put the language into practice and became more comfortable applying it to academic and professional pursuits. As our language improved, we had the freedom to pursue our interests, in my case modern history and politics. In my final year, with the assistance of faculty staff, I was able to publish two papers.After graduation I started work at a large e-commerce company in Manchester. I manage business development and manage a small team responsible for trading strategy. We improve the channels through which we sell cross border, and I help the company grow and understand  the opportunities and challenges in this diverse, complex market. I represent the company in China, leading negotiations with Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu and project-managing infrastructure development (i.e. customer service centres and warehousing).You leave AMES a generalist with an understanding of a region. This has its advantages, but also its challenges. I work as a bridge between two groups of specialists, but had to make mistakes and learn very fast to add value to this process, and now am trusted to solve the problems that that arise between these groups of people. Since you add genuine value and understanding, people seek you out to help them ‘do China’ in all kinds of industries. Studying at Cambridge puts you at an advantage against many others in this position. Firstly, because the AMES course gives you a thorough linguistic and cultural grounding, which joint degrees at other universities simply cannot. Secondly, because your final two years teach you to think, which is at the requirement at the core of managing the complex, multi-party, trans-cultural, fast-paced problems you encounter in commerce."Greg McMillan wrote this in 2017, after having graduated in 2016 When it came to choosing a subject to study at university, I was at first torn between Chinese and History as my main interest lay in Chinese history. Eventually, I decided that it would make little sense to study Chinese history without knowing Chinese and decided to apply to read Chinese in Cambridge. What was helpful was that I knew that the course in Cambridge would not only give me the chance to acquire a solid knowledge of the Chinese language, but also would give me the opportunity to develop my interest in Chinese history. Looking back now, I am certain I made the right decision. During my four years studying Chinese as an undergraduate, I developed a solid grasp of both modern and classical research. At the same time, the many history options the degree course offers allowed me to develop my interest in Chinese history. By the third year, I had developed an interest in the history of modern China, particularly the history of modern Sino-German relations. As a former German colony, Qingdao, where I spent my year abroad, proved the ideal place to further pursue this topic and start work on my final year dissertation. It was also in Qingdao that I decided to continue my research as a postgraduate after graduation, as I felt that there was much more I wanted to explore than what I could do in my undergraduate dissertation. During my fourth year, I wrote a dissertation on the German colonial presence in Qingdao and started to write applications for postgraduate study and funding.Luckily, I was eventually accepted to stay at FAMES to do a PhD on German banking in modern China, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (read more about this here: https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/chinese/phd/testimonies-of-past-and-current-students).  Even though life as a PhD student is very different from undergraduate life with much more freedom to pursue one’s interests, my training in Chinese language and Chinese history have been the basis for my postgraduate research. It would have been impossible to read original sources in Chinese and navigate the vast historiography in modern Chinese history without the solid training I received as an undergraduate student. The level of modern Chinese I acquired as an undergraduate also made it possible for me to present my research in Chinese at conferences in China and cooperate with Chinese colleagues.  Finally, writing my undergraduate dissertation gave me the basic skills that I could build on when writing my PhD dissertation. Graduating soon with my doctoral degree, I will move to Tokyo to continue my research on the history of China’s modern finance with a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Tokyo, funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The skills I gained as an undergraduate will not only continue to help me in my research but also prove valuable as I tackle the challenges presented by yet another new country and language.Ghassan Moazzin (Chinese Studies, 2008-2012)           © 2017 University of Cambridge

We are particularly pleased by the enthusiastic response from some older graduates, who show us how much their knowledge of Chinese language and Chinese culture has enriched their careers and lives. Where appropriate we have provided links to related sites.We are in the process of collecting more testimonies, especially from more recent graduates. Please contact Dr Adam Chau at ayc25@cam.ac.uk if you are a former student of the programme and wish to submit a testimony/reminiscence. Geoff Sampson, Oriental Studies, 1965 Current Job: Academic (retired)It was a different world.  China, then, did not feel like somewhere one might actually go to.  Our tiny undergraduate band were being let in on the secrets of a great civilization that, to almost any Brit, was a blank Terra Incognita.  I started learning Chinese as a schoolboy hobby, expecting to play with it for a few weeks, but soon I was hooked – when it came to university applications, I knew this was the subject for me.  I remember our first history lecture:  “There are three of us to teach you Chinese history, so we are taking a millennium each”.  By graduation I was convinced that every student ought to be required to study Sinology:  what other subject gives such a vivid sense of how unlike ours a successful human society can be?We were offered a linguistics option, and that hooked me too, so I left for graduate study in the USA which centred on linguistics, though I also took courses about a new kind of machine called computers.  Returning to Britain I climbed the academic ladder, eventually being appointed to a linguistics chair in 1984.  Halfway through my career, though, linguistics came to seem a discipline past its sell-by date.  I seized a chance to move into informatics, with periods of industrial research.  I reached retirement age teaching and writing about electronic business, and I.T. law. A nomadic career, then, but I never lost sight of Chinese – in 2006 I published a book of translations from the Book of Odes.I have been very lucky.  Thank you, Cambridge! John EverardCurrent Job: Retired Diplomat I chose Chinese studies by accident.  I started out studying Part 1 French and German but I got drunk at a party and told all my friends that I was going to switch to Chinese.  By the time I had sobered up the humiliation of backing out of this would have been too great, so I told a rather surprised Oriental faculty that I should be joining them.  I have never regretted the decision.  I was able to spend a year in Beijing University as one of only the third group of foreign students after the Cultural Revolution - a quite different China from that of today.  I was able to serve in the British Embassy in Beijing on two tours and I used my Chinese extensively during frequent breaks in Beijing from Pyongyang, my last FCO posting, and occasionally during my job coordinating the Panel of Experts on North Korea for the United Nations Security Council.  I still comment widely on Asian affairs and follow the ins and outs of Chinese foreign policy.  Hilary Lade, Class of 1976Studying Chinese gave me an experience different to all of my friends at Cambridge:  I was part of a small team with a huge amount of individual teaching contact, my teachers had amazing ‘back stories’ of experience outside academia and my eyes were opened to a culture that – just like Britain – had always considered itself to be the centre of the world – the ‘Central Kingdom’.  Studying Chinese may have taught me a language, but it introduced me to the world.I gained a Harkness Fellowship on leaving Cambridge and studied in the United States at Harvard and Berkeley, but academia wasn’t for me and I returned to the UK to join Shell, initially working on a coal project for China.  Shell however had many opportunities wider than China and I spent several very happy years travelling and trading cargoes of oil products – some in and out of China! – and then running a subsidiary company in the UK gas business.Many of life’s best breaks come about by a chance event and it was seeing an advertisement to run Fountains Abbey for the National Trust that took me out of the business world and into the charitable and public sector.  This then led to appointments as varied as Director of Historic Properties at English Heritage, the selection panel for the UK European Capital of Culture in 2008 and as a Board member at the Heritage Lottery Fund deciding on millions of pounds worth of investment at every meeting.  As the positions became non-executive (part time) rather than full time it has also left time to fulfil a lifelong dream of playing more music on the viola and sailing a small classic yacht (but not both at the same time!)Was this the career I expected when I interviewed at Cambridge to study Chinese?  No, but I have enough Chinese to travel off the beaten track and talk to local people in China, and Cambridge gave a background to the culture which helps to put China’s current and future position in the world into context.  And the career?  It’s been great fun. Christopher Homfray, Class of 1976Current Job: Adviser at NHS ScotlandWhen I came up to Cambridge in October 1976, Mao Zedong had been dead only a few weeks and the Cultural Revolution was just over.  China seemed a strange and mysterious place – well until, that is, my first essay on modern China was marked A- with the single comment “isn’t it all about bicycles?” So started a wonderful intellectual journey of discovery around the obvious truth that China and Chinese people are neither strange, nor mysterious nor inscrutable, but rather just different in all sorts of interesting ways. On graduating in 1980, I won a scholarship to study in northern China and had two years in Ji'nan and Beijing. After one year teaching Chinese near London, I was successful at CSSB and was appointed to the Hong Kong Government.My knowledge of China and of Mandarin, and then also Cantonese, was the foundation for a career in colonial government, followed by six years in consultancy in Hong Kong through the handover years. My China studies and experience also inspired a subsequent decade working in equality in NHS Scotland, and my current work with refugees in the British Red Cross in Glasgow, both of which revolve around cross-cultural experience and understanding. Stephen Jones, Class of 1976Current Job: Author, Ethnographer, Ethnomusicologist, BloggerIn lieu of a reminiscence,  Stephen Jones, ethnographer of rural Chinese ritual and music, invites you to visit his blog: https://stephenjones.blog ("Daoism—lives—language—performance. And jokes") with rich material on ethnographic fieldwork, his lifelong experience as orchestral violinist, Stella Gibbons, Bach, Amy Winehouse,  the GDR, and so on.

My most recent China job was Chief Representative of John Swire and Sons in China. Also that previously I had postings to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Germany with Cathay Pacific Airways. Swire has been a fantastic company to work for. They have a strong emphasis on training and development, and it is guaranteed that you will have interesting and challenging assignments from day one. Speaking Chinese, it is guaranteed that you will receive postings in China in one of the many divisions.  Guy Chambers, Class of 1993Current Job: Group Managing Director, James Finley LtdI graduated in 1993 and joined John Swire & Sons to start a career in business in Greater China. Have had a variety of jobs across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - all of which beverage-related. From 1993-2012, I worked in Swire Beverages, setting up Coca-Cola JVs in China, followed by building bottling plants then setting up distribution networks to cover the country. Since 2012, I have been selling tea globally, including in China (!), in a Swire-owned business called Finlays (founded in 1750). There has not been a day that I have regretted studying Chinese. I continue to build my knowledge of Chinese history and treat Mandarin as a valuable second language. Clare Wijeratne, Class of 2000Current job: Global policy analyst, BHP BillitonMy career has taken a few twists and turns since graduating from Cambridge, but at each step, the fact that I hold a degree in Chinese studies has been a positive factor in helping me win the position I have been seeking.Immediately after graduating I went into strategy consulting with Bain & Company. This provided an invaluable grounding in many basic business skills. But spreadsheets weren’t for me and so after two years I moved to join the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a diplomat. I was quickly posted overseas to Hong Kong for three years, then spent three years in London before another posting overseas, this time to New Delhi. In each of these roles, and understanding of China and its aspirations and role in the world was important. At the end of my time in Delhi, my husband and I were keen to remain in Asia, so we relocated to Singapore where I joined a niche consulting firm in the business intelligence sector. From there, in early 2017, I moved to BHP Billiton, the Anglo-Australian mining company, still based in Singapore. I am global policy analyst, helping the company to track and understand government policy decision making, and the impact that it can have on our business and on demand for our commodities. China remains the largest market for most of our commodities, and so understanding government policy on everything from energy use to electric cars to urbanisation to population management is really vital. And even though I’m not speaking Chinese regularly, in one way or another, I use the skills I developed at Cambridge every day. Greg McMillan, Class of 2016Current job: Astrup Fearnley AS - Shipbroker (the testimony below was written when Greg was with the Hut Group, an e-commerce company)The highlight of my time at Cambridge was the second half of my degree - studying abroad at Peking University and doing Part II back at Cambridge. After two hard years of learning characters and getting the basics, I learnt how to put the language into practice and became more comfortable applying it to academic and professional pursuits. As our language improved, we had the freedom to pursue our interests, in my case modern history and politics. In my final year, with the assistance of faculty staff, I was able to publish two papers.After graduation I started work at a large e-commerce company in Manchester. I manage business development and manage a small team responsible for trading strategy. We improve the channels through which we sell cross border, and I help the company grow and understand  the opportunities and challenges in this diverse, complex market. I represent the company in China, leading negotiations with Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu and project-managing infrastructure development (i.e. customer service centres and warehousing).You leave AMES a generalist with an understanding of a region. This has its advantages, but also its challenges. I work as a bridge between two groups of specialists, but had to make mistakes and learn very fast to add value to this process, and now am trusted to solve the problems that that arise between these groups of people. Since you add genuine value and understanding, people seek you out to help them ‘do China’ in all kinds of industries. Studying at Cambridge puts you at an advantage against many others in this position. Firstly, because the AMES course gives you a thorough linguistic and cultural grounding, which joint degrees at other universities simply cannot. Secondly, because your final two years teach you to think, which is at the requirement at the core of managing the complex, multi-party, trans-cultural, fast-paced problems you encounter in commerce. © 2017 University of Cambridge

Lectures and seminars are combined with personalized supervisions to cater for a form of education that empowers each of you as active learners while giving caring support and thoughtful guidance.  First year (Part IA): Gaining solid grounding The first year focusses mainly on language learning, as almost 75 percent of your time will be devoted to the study of Japanese in all its components: reading, writing, listening and speaking. By the end of the second term (around mid-March) of the first year, you will have covered all the basic grammar and mastered around 650 kanji (Chinese logographic characters). This means that you will have already acquired the skills that enable you to read real-world texts (paper ‘J.3: modern Japanese Texts’) during the third term of the same year. While developing a solid grounding in the language, you will study Japanese history and culture as part of the wider East Asian region (paper ‘EAS1’). This paper fosters the development of analytical and interpretative skills when engaging with East Asian primary and secondary sources. While introducing student to major themes in East Asia, the paper also encourages familiarity with theoretical approaches in different disciplines in the study of East Asia. Second year (Part IB): Going deeper and broaderThe second year continues to offer extensive teaching in the language. Language classes are designed specifically to prepare you for living and studying in Japan in the third year as well as for the more advanced study in the fourth year. You will learn new grammar while reading and translating excerpts from a wide range of real-world texts (e.g., newspapers articles, literary texts, non-fictional essays, etc.). You will also have a chance to discuss and write about them. This will take you through intermediate to early-advanced Japanese. Our BA also offers the opportunity for you to develop a more mature understanding of the Japanese language via the study of pre-modern Japanese. We do so having devised an innovative syllabus, which aims to teach classical grammar in a rigorous manner while reading intriguing texts (both canonical and non-canonical) produced from the early-modern era back in time to the Heian period. Meanwhile you are exposed to the variety of disciplines that our course offers: Japanese history, literature, society, and politics. You can also choose cultural papers from Chinese Studies as well as a cross-departmental paper in East Asian Film Studies. It is in the second year that you also begin brainstorming around the area and the topic you wish to research for your undergraduate dissertation. Of course, you are not left alone in this challenging and equally rewarding task. Our teaching staff helps you identifying a possible supervisor who will guide you in the first steps of this exciting intellectual endeavour. Third year: the Year AbroadThis is year when the knowledge and skills developed in the first two years come alive with you studying and living in Japan. To understand more about this year, please read the dedicated page on our Year Abroad. Fourth year (Part II): Generating knowledgeYou are back from the enriching Year Abroad. Your Japanese is so advanced that you can now read and discuss a variety of sources in Japanese. Japanese language is still taught with the aim to prepare you with the language skills necessary in a professional Japanese-speaking environment (be it in business, diplomacy, research or other fields).  You will be learning to make oral presentations and to write texts using the appropriate linguistic register. You will also learn to discuss a wide range of topics in Japanese and to translate advanced literary and academic texts from Japanese into English. While At the same time you can choose from a range of elective papers that allow you a deeper understanding of the disciplines you are interested in. And this is also the year during which you produce yourself new knowledge about Japan. Your dissertation, for which you would have done extensive work during your Year Abroad, now comes together in a highly original piece of writing that opens new horizons in the field of Japanese Studies. You can find examples of undergraduate dissertations in the field of Japanese society in: Brigitte Steger and Angelika Koch (eds.). Manga Girl Seeks Herbivore Boy. Studying Japanese Gender at Cambridge. Zurich: Lit, 2013. Of course you can write about a variety of different topics in other fields, relating both to pre-modern and modern eras. © 2017 University of Cambridge

You cannot study the two languages concurrently. If you take this option, you will not have a year abroad. Instead, you will be resident in Cambridge in your third year, studying basic Chinese.You are advised to put only one language as the subject on your application form, irrespective of whether you plan to do the combination in your third and fourth years at Cambridge. As you might expect, mastering two demanding Asian languages is no small achievement and we generally recommend this option only for students with particularly strong linguistic aptitude or those who may have had extensive prior exposure to one of the two languages before arriving at Cambridge.Japanese cannot be combined with languages from the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages.Japanese Studies students who are interested in the Korean language can take a paper in Korean in their fourth year.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern StudiesStudying at CambridgeThe years I spent at the AMES faculty and in Japan were consequential in bringing me to where I am now. My story starts with enrolling in Japanese studies in 2012 (St John's College); an experience that spawned a passion to begin exploring East Asian politics and foreign relations. Today I’m studying for a master’s degree in international relations at Sciences Po, Paris. Looking back at my time in Cambridge, I feel that the things I learnt there had positive outcomes that I am only starting to grasp now. Sure, I knew at the time that I would graduate with specialized knowledge of Japan and proficiency in Japanese. However, I would never have been able to tell you how the intellectual stimulation of the degree would help me later on. For example, the experience of having discussed complex issues concerning East Asia, while specialised, has proven to be a great asset in my daily policy-related studies.Coming from the unique experience that Cambridge is, switching to a different education system was a challenge in the beginning. However, once I wrapped my head around the new system life began to settle in. I like to think that while Cambridge taught me to think, Sciences Po teaches me to apply that thinking. Thus far, I have completed work on policy briefs, participated in negotiation simulations, and learnt a variety of hands-on skills relevant to diplomacy. The great thing about Sciences Po’s PSIA school is also the sheer quantity of interesting topics taught by top-level professionals in the field. It’s definitely exciting to be able to balance the academic style of Cambridge with the more professional style of Sciences Po. I believe this combination will help me achieve my ambition of working with political/business matters concerning both Japan and Europe.I have touched upon the teaching style of Cambridge, but the impact of my time there goes beyond that. I believe the environment itself, in addition to the very personal and family-like atmosphere of the university and the AMES faculty helps nurture confidence and a sense of belonging. I think this applies particularly to the Japanese department, where we were all very much in the same boat throughout our degree. Furthermore, when one pursues classes that range from classical languages to politics, it is sometimes difficult to make sense of it all, but ultimately, I believe it renders you capable to interpret and analyse any situation that you might face in the future.So to conclude, I really only have good things to say about the AMES degree. I think if you have a passion for Japan and East Asian matters this is the degree for you. At the end of the day, Cambridge degrees are similar in their structure and academic focus, but if you want a degree that opens doors and where your individual ambitions are catered for, pursuing a degree in Japanese Studies is undoubtedly the right way to go about it.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Forensic accountancy does not really look like the obvious choice for a graduate of Japanese Studies. Why did you choose this career? How difficult was it for you to find a job that interested you after graduation?Ed: While forensic accountancy doesn’t seem to be an obvious choice for a Japanese Studies graduate, I’m not sure what the “obvious choice” would be apart from translation work or further study. I struggled to get a job immediately after graduation, partly due to a personal lack of direction and desire for any particular career and partly due to a lack of work experience (I was very lazy in my holidays!)Fortunately, everything turned out well as I decided to go on a working holiday in Japan, which gave me the opportunity to improve my Japanese further and gain work experience. The type of jobs I had (I spent four months working at a ski resort, for example) also allowed me to see a very different side of Japan than the one I saw at Doshisha University in Kyoto during my year abroad. Many of my co-workers were itinerant workers, often with various addictions, who had to move around Japan relying on low-paid seasonal jobs to get by. They were great fun to work with, though, and were a stark contrast with the largely well-off students of Doshisha, many of whom go on to white-collar jobs.My father is an accountant, so I have always been aware of accountancy as a career choice. I also became interested in corruption during the course of my dissertation research (Rural Revitalization in Japan), through which I learned about the Japanese construction industry. This industry is frequently used to prop up rural economies by means of ‘white-elephant’ construction projects that negatively impact the landscape and involve a fair amount of corruption. Consequently, when I returned to England and started looking for jobs, I saw a forensic accountancy opening and thought, “Why not?” Fortunately, I was able to tie it up fairly quickly. A working holiday filled with random jobs is a handy thing in interviews!BS: Could you tell us more about what you do now? Have you had any exciting cases/discoveries?Ed: Unfortunately, fraud work has been fairly thin on the ground and I spend more time in the rather more mundane world of audit. However, the forensic projects I have worked on have been very interesting, although unfortunately I can’t go into detail about what I’ve been doing on them. While the technical work on forensic projects is often nothing special, the context of the case makes it interesting and you get the feeling that you are doing something concrete to make the world a better, less corrupt place.BS: I assume that not many forensic accountants come to their job via a degree in Japanese Studies. Could you let us know how your studies at Cambridge have been helpful in your current career?Ed: I think that the greatest asset I received from my time at Cambridge and my year abroad in Japan was an international mindset and an increased cultural awareness and acceptance of other people as a result of studying and living with people from all over the world. This has been useful in my workplace, as even in my graduate intake there were people from all over the world, including some countries which have marked cultural differences with the UK. I think that my international experience has allowed me to get along better with these people, while others have clashed with them as a result of these differences.Research skills gained while working on my dissertation have also come in handy on forensic projects (I’m currently doing a lot of research into the business environment of an African country). I think that studying a humanities subject also gives you a certain mindset that can come in useful in careers like accountancy where most people have studied a more technical subject. I never thought I’d say this, but there are times when you can tell who’s done humanities and who hasn’t!BS: What are your best memories of Cambridge and of Japanese Studies?Ed: My best memory of Cambridge and Japanese studies isn’t really of Cambridge at all – it’s of course the year abroad in Kyoto, and perhaps more specifically cycling around the city on my bike. I don’t really have the words to describe how fantastic it was to have the opportunity to spend a year studying in one of the best cities in the world. I met a lot of people from all around the world, got super-tanned working on a farm at the weekends (for fun!), and of course did a lot of touristy stuff. I even managed to learn some Japanese!If I had to pick something I miss about Cambridge, I would say the libraries. They are a fantastic resource, not just for essays but also for exploring whatever random interests you may have. You don’t really appreciate how good they are – and how great it is to be able to just wander in, pick up a random book and read for hours – until you’ve left. Oddly enough, I also have fond memories of my dissertation. The process of researching and writing was painful, but once it was done, I felt pretty proud of having produced a piece of original research in an area in which I was interested, and I still do research around my dissertation topic when things are slow at work.BS: I am pleased to hear that. I remember that you seemed to enjoy your language classes much more than your research for your dissertation!Is there anything you would like to tell young people who are thinking of applying to enroll in Japanese Studies at Cambridge?Ed: I would say go for it! Fortunately, the UK isn’t the kind of country where what you study at university necessarily becomes your career, so there is no real need to worry about studying a more niche subject and ending up with limited career options. The year of study abroad is also a concern for some people, but don’t worry about it. You’ll have the time of your life, and if you’ve survived two years of Japanese at Cambridge, Doshisha won’t pose too much of an academic threat.Interview: Dr Brigitte Steger, April 2016© 2017 University of Cambridge

We work mostly with large banks and corporates and practise a range of law, from finance to litigation. I am due to complete my training period in March 2018, at which time I will choose a department to join as an associate. Corporate law may not seem the natural place to end up having done an undergraduate degree in Japanese, but I had a long-standing and parallel interest in law, crime and sociology throughout my secondary and tertiary education. My particular interest was in crime and legal sociology in the Japanese context – what factors explained Japan's comparatively low crime rates amongst developed nations; what informed the particular ways in which crime was expressed in Japan; and how Japanese law interacted with social and cultural norms to shape the ways in which deviance was performed and regulated. While on my year abroad at Waseda University I wrote a comparative essay on youth crime in the UK and Japan, and in the final year of my degree course I performed a speech about so-called "toorima" incidents at the UK Japanese Speech Contest for University Students.After graduating, I looked at studying in Japan but was unable to locate any criminology courses. I therefore turned my attention stateside, with a long-term ambition of getting a general criminological education there before returning to Japan to continue my studies at a more advanced level. I was accepted onto the PhD Criminology and Criminal Justice programme at the University of Maryland but ended up leaving after two years once I completed my M.A., as I had realized that I did not want to continue in academia indefinitely, and that my studies there did not realistically afford me the contact with Japanese language and culture that I found myself missing.When I decided to leave academic life, I applied to a range of jobs – all were based in London, but all had to meet a single criterion: that they offered the chance to work in Japan. Law firms were attractive since many had Tokyo offices to which it was relatively easy to be seconded either temporarily or permanently, and this also meshed well with my interest in law. In particular, Clifford Chance stood out as a firm which actively encouraged its employees to travel abroad, and which seemed especially to value language and cultural skills in its global workforce. As part of my training period at Clifford Chance, I will be going out to work in the Tokyo office from March to September 2017, with the potential for longer secondments further down the line should I wish to return.What I think was particularly helpful about the education I received at Cambridge is that it not only gave me the opportunity to study the Japanese language (which I was happy to do in my own time, to be honest!) but it nurtured and encouraged my interest in other aspects of Japan. I had the opportunity in studying Japanese sociology to explore my interests in crime and law, which have been so influential in shaping my career to date. Separately, it never fails to make Japanese people laugh with surprise when I recite the opening paragraph of the Houjouki!More broadly, my years at Cambridge were an unparalleled opportunity to explore new interests and try my hand at various projects without the time constraints or pressure to achieve which increasingly dominate life in higher education and the workplace. While at Cambridge I was involved to a greater or lesser degree in theatre, magazine and newspaper editing, article writing, acting on a society board, and more. In particular, the collegiate system at Cambridge allows for myriad societies and groups, with plenty of roles for everyone to take on. It is an excellent way to build confidence and find and develop new interests, which may be peripheral or unconnected to your studies but which may yet open up new avenues for your academic and career development going forward.The key thing I have learnt is not to get too fixated on one career, one job, one course or one scholarship. It may seem that there is only the one opportunity for you to get what you want (or to go where you want) but reality is rarely that simple. If something does not work out, then there are likely a whole host of other ways of getting to the same place, even if some of those may take a bit longer, or be a little less direct. I would never have thought, when I was at university, that my current job would allow me the opportunity to use my Japanese or live in Japan, but it is one of many careers which allow for relocation to and/or contact with Japan. Do not assume that the only way you can go out to Japan or use your Japanese degree is to remain a student, or do a government scheme, or become a translator! Be conscious of how attractive language skills and, perhaps even more, understanding of another culture can make you in this increasingly globalised world. Many of my fellow trainee lawyers also completed language degrees as undergraduates, and we have easily kept up with those who studied law at interviews, during legal training and in day-to-day work. Many professions are open to linguists, and studying a language as interesting, unusual and impressive as Japanese will, if anything, make your application stand out amongst the pack.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to talk to us about your career during your visit to Cambridge. Could you tell us how you got into investment banking?  My main interests have always been in language and literature. In 1989, I was accepted to read French and German at Trinity Hall, but I decided to spend a gap year in China first. There, I was introduced to Japanese literature through the books of Mishima Yukio and Endo Shusaku. So, when I returned to Cambridge in 1991, I talked to Prof Richard Bowring and was accepted to read Japanese Studies. This was just after the bubble economy had burst, but there were still some twenty students in my year, some of whom subsequently transferred to different subjects. A total of eight of us graduated from the course.In February 1993, I participated in a Japanese speech contest and won the Sir Peter Parker Award for Spoken Business Japanese. In the audience, there was a representative from Toyota who offered me an internship at Toyota in summer 1993 and again in 1994. I actually wrote my dissertation on the auto parts industry, but at Toyota I worked in the Public Affairs division, and it was there that I first came into contact with investment banking, albeit from the research side.During my student days, the study-abroad period was only three months, so we spent Michaelmas term in Kanazawa. When I returned to Cambridge, my friends – who mostly did three-year degrees – were about to graduate and had been applying for jobs. Therefore, I was able to observe how many of them went into investment banking and consulting.I began my career at SBC Warburg in 1995 in London. Since I remained keen to live in Japan post graduation, I first did a summer internship with the company in Tokyo (before starting full time in London), and then worked for three years in London to develop a solid foundation in investment banking. In April 1998, I transferred to Tokyo. I ended up staying there for 12 years! During my time in Tokyo I changed companies. I have been working at Goldman Sachs since 2006, and moved down to Hong Kong in January 2010. All told, I have twenty-one years’ experience in investment banking. Could you tell us more about your current role? I am currently Head of the Financial Strategic Investors Group for Asia Pacific (including Japan) and Head of Investment Banking Services for Asia ex-Japan.We provide investment banking services for our clients, including (but not limited to) mergers and acquisitions, financing and associated risk management. As I have become more senior, I have assumed the responsibility of managing some of our most important client relationships on the investment banking side within Asia. What is particularly fulfilling is to have the opportunity to help our clients to pursue their strategic ambitions.I travel throughout the Asia Pacific region, almost weekly. This gives me exposure to many different cultures. I work with clients in China, Korea, Japan, India, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. I conduct most of my business in English. I am very comfortable using Japanese in a professional context, but unfortunately my spoken Chinese is limited to informal conversations. And although I do not speak Korean, I enjoy listening to the language and discovering similarities with other East Asian languages. What were the most important things you learned in Japanese Studies at Cambridge?I came into contact with Japan through literature, which I was (and remain!) very passionate about. I am convinced that if you are passionate about what you do, then you are more likely to do it very well. More broadly, however, what Cambridge nurtured in me was the ability to think and formulate opinions independently.So when I interview prospective future employees, I look for three things: a basic (but genuine) interest in the position that they are applying for, the ability to think independently, and the determination to work very, very hard.I have had to do many different things throughout my banking career, but one thing has never changed: work can be long, tiring and lonely. But for anyone who wants to be successful, be it academically or in sport, you need guts and stamina.  Do you still have time to read literature?Yes, I do. Actually, in 2000 I felt that I was selling my soul to the devil and decided to read at least one book a month! (And the nerd that I am, I have continued to record what I have read.) I still have an interest in Japanese literature and sometimes I read in Japanese, such as works by Murakami Haruki. One of the best books I read last year was ‘A Little Life’ by the Hawaiian author Yanagihara Hanya, and I was lucky to be able to attend an interview she gave at The Hong Kong Literary Festival. The situation in the world of banking and business has changed. Do you have some advice for our current students?When I was a student, the financial bubble in Japan had just burst, so my choice of Japanese was not because of the job prospects.It is not the case in all countries, but for investment banking, especially in the UK, you don’t require a background in finance. Of course, when you apply for a job, you need to read up on finance and banking in order to demonstrate your interest during the interview. The criteria for acceptance are primarily whether you can work long hours, think independently and are flexible and willing to adjust.With a degree in Japanese Studies, you don’t really have an advantage over other people in your job search (in terms of possessing the technical expertise of a computer scientist, a medic or a lawyer) unless your focus is a career that is in or related to Japan. But your experience of studying a foreign language enables you to look at things from a different perspective. This gives you flexibility and the ability to put yourself in other people’s shoes. I think that is a very useful skill indeed.Interview by Miki Kawabata and Brigitte Steger; December 2016© 2017 University of Cambridge

I started as a Japanese equity fund manager in London, but after two years was head-hunted into a role as a brokerage analyst in Tokyo at James Capel (which later became HSBC Securities). I spent a decade and a half at HSBC in Tokyo and London, eventually becoming Head of Research in Tokyo, and later Head of Global Equity Strategy at the Canary Wharf HQ.But I’d always had a hankering to become an academic, so I dropped out of banking in 2004 and returned to Cambridge to do a PhD on the economics of the Japanese tax system. Translation work helped to pay the bills, but slowed the PhD, until in 2007, another approach from a head-hunter tempted me to drop it altogether. I moved back to Tokyo as the British Council’s Director in Japan, concurrently acting as Cultural Counsellor at the British Embassy. A very happy four years there working on cultural and educational links between the UK and Japan was only slightly marred by the constant need to restructure, as the UK’s “age of austerity” reduced the Council’s government funding.In my current role as Director General of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation I do much the same sort of job at the London end of the relationship. Because of our role as one of the main funders in this sector, I am fortunate to be able to maintain close relationships with the university sector in general, and the Japanese Studies community in particular. Many academic books on Japan are launched at the Foundation, and we also have a programme of scholarships for post-graduate Japanologists.My love for Japan and its people has only increased over the years, and the excellent grounding in the language that I received at Cambridge has been an invaluable tool. My classical Japanese is rusty these days, but a little knowledge of the classics goes a long way in diplomatic circles, while the exposure the Cambridge course gave me to Japan’s history and religion has helped me understand the broader cultural context taken for granted by my many Japanese contacts and friends. The photograph shows me with my wife at a James Bond-themed party on a British warship moored in Tokyo Bay (note the helicopter in the background). Parties are, believe it or not, an essential part of my job!March 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

I came to Cambridge excited to finally learn Japanese, something I’d been interested in for many years. I was also delighted to realise just how active the university drama scene is; before arriving, I hadn’t quite appreciated the scope of opportunities to perform. From the very first term, I rehearsed and performed at the ADC Theatre alongside my academic work. I loved balancing the mental challenge of tackling Japanese from scratch with the physical challenge of long theatre rehearsals and nightly performances.I loved the pace and scope of the Japanese course at Cambridge. It is a challenging programme, but learning the basics of the language so quickly was incredibly rewarding. I was also very pleased to discover the variety of historical / cultural / linguistic modules available to us. Although I had not seriously studied Japanese before applying, a few others in my class had quite significant knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. By the end of the second term, however, we were approaching a similar level. The first two years' language classes revolve heavily around textbook learning, with perhaps fewer opportunities for conversation than at other universities, but I do not think this is a disadvantage. In fact, I was all the more motivated to make Japanese friends in Kyoto and put the extensive grammar and vocabulary I'd studied at home into practice. I was amazed at how much I had actually learned in such a short time; it was incredibly fulfilling to spend whole days and weeks speaking only in Japanese, when two years previously I barely knew a word. Thanks to the fast pace of the first two years' training, students from Cambridge seem to be able to throw themselves into busy and exciting social lives in Japan in a way that students from other courses may not have the confidence to do. I definitely have the Japanese course at Cambridge to thank for some of the best friends and most memorable experiences of my life.During my year abroad, I had a few opportunities to perform. I sang in public concerts and appeared on local and national television. I also went to see several plays in Japanese. One company in particular, Chiten, inspired me to write about Shakespeare in Japan for my final dissertation. I quickly discovered that this is a well documented area of research, so I narrowed my focus down to the work of one translator / director, Fukuda Tsuneari. The majority of his writing has not been translated into English, so I relied heavily on my relatively new language skills to work through his lengthy, often rambling philosophies. These wandered from drama and Shakespeare through to the meaning of ‘modernity’ and his perceived need for an uprising in modern Japanese society. He believed that performances of Shakespeare (specifically Hamlet) could catalyse such a revolution. Needless to say, it was quite a challenge to work through his ideas and the process took over a year. I recently found out though that the dissertation won the Ivan Morris Memorial Prize, so perhaps there was some method in the madness!During my fourth year, unsure about what I wanted to do in the future, I applied to a few MA Musical Theatre programmes. I wasn’t successful on my first attempt, and decided instead to return to Japan with the WWOOF scheme, whereby volunteers live and work on rural farms across the country. This would allow me to travel more widely and really get to grips with the language. Before I left for Japan, I applied once more to the MA Musical Theatre programme at the Royal Academy of Music in London. I found out during my trip that I had been successful, and so returned to the UK after 6 months to begin studying Musical Theatre in Autumn 2015. I had the most interesting experiences as a WWOOFer though and would love to go back to Japan with the programme again, to see new places and try my hand at different jobs.During my year at the Royal Academy of Music, I didn’t have much opportunity to practise Japanese, although I was very grateful to be able to earn some money as a Japanese tutor in the holidays. I threw myself into studying music, drama and dance, and was taken on by an acting agency before graduation. This led to my first job: performing as Alice in Anthony Neilson’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland at the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh. I’ve just returned and am now auditioning for future roles. I still work on the side as a Japanese tutor, which is a great way to support life in London.Although I am now mainly working as an actress and model, I still relish opportunities to combine my interests. For the past few years I have been working as the drama coach on the Keio-Downing Summer School in Cambridge. 60 Japanese students spend the summer in Downing College, and at the beginning of their stay we work together to help them build confidence and interpersonal skills that will aid them throughout the programme. It’s an incredibly rewarding process and I look forward to joining them again this summer!If I were to give any advice to my kohai (juniors), in drama or in Japanese, I would tell them to follow their passions, however impractical or incongruent they might seem. Instead of aiming for a particular future point or career aspiration and making sacrifices that seem appropriate on the way, see where your unique interests take you and what path they naturally carve out.Many of the jobs and experiences I've had in the past few years have required a great deal of stamina, diligence, confidence and curiosity. I can say without a doubt that I first developed these strengths whilst studying Japanese at Cambridge, and whilst learning to live alone in Japan. Cambridge is where I learned to work hard, but also where I realised the true rewards and possibilities opened up by doing so.January 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

I also had not been able to see, do and experience all that Japan had to offer. While I was interested in continuing in academia, I was also keen to work beforehand, and put my skills to use. The JET Programme: Coordinator for International RelationsWhen looking through the Camcareers website, I found a job listing for the JET Program, a well-known program which sends English speakers to work in Japanese schools as Assistant Language Teachers. However, this sounded very different from teaching English. With Japanese skills as a must, this job would be based in the international and tourism departments of Japanese local governments, and would involve translation, interpreting, event planning, assisting foreign visitors, and much more. The role is known as Coordinator for International Relations, and it sounded ideal for me. I decided to apply and see if I could get a place. The JET Program is notoriously competitive, and CIRs only make up around 5% of JET participants every year. The criteria involve Japanese ability around JLPT N2 level, a good honours degree, fair knowledge and appreciation for your own country and culture, and a desire to help with internationalization while living and working in Japan. You are able to specify your preferences for location, but it is very unlikely you will actually be placed there, particularly as a CIR when there are so few positions available. Applying to the JET ProgrammeFirst applicants apply online, and then send four copies of their form and other documents to the JET Office – in the end my forms totaled around eighty sheets of paper! After this is the interview stage. For CIRs, the interview takes place almost entirely in Japanese, and includes reading comprehension. The questions are all very practical, and aim to see how you would approach the role you were given. Depending on your location and your work environment, job requirements for CIRs can be drastically different. Some people spend a lot of time on school visits and events; some barely leave the office for translation work. Some will have to interpret for prestigious political events; some might never have to interpret at all. Some will have a very strict job description, and some can create their own work and projects, to be continued by the CIRs who follow them. As far as the interview questions and my experience go, although it is very important to have a concrete idea of what you want to bring to the role, JET looks for versatility and enthusiasm most of all from its participants. My work in the Yamanashi Prefectural OfficeIn the end, I was accepted onto the JET Programme as a CIR, and placed in the Global Exchange and Tourism Department of the Yamanashi Prefectural Office, in the capital city of Kofu. When I told my Japanese friend, she laughed and told me it was so rural most people haven’t even heard of it. Kofu City is definitely a quieter city than most. It is located in a basin, surrounded by mountains almost 3,000 ft high, often rising over above the clouds. And on a good day, in the distance, Mt Fuji rises above them all. My work mostly involves translation work: emails and letters, pages of the website, promotional information for the prefecture. People from across the Prefectural Office will bring work for translation, and the variation keeps things interesting. There are also quite a few interpreting jobs, for when visitors from outside Japan come on business or official trips. My first interpreting job took place over three days, for employees of a food company in Singapore, who visited many small businesses and farms across the prefecture. Not only was it a fun challenge, I was also able to try many of the products and see the sights of Yamanashi along with the visitors. I also help update the blog and go on school visits, telling students all about the UK. The charm of Yamanashi PrefectureOn the weekends, there is plenty to see and do – and working in the tourism office, I quickly learnt about what Yamanashi has to offer. All the mountains in the prefecture mean it is very sparsely populated, but hiking is a very popular pastime, and it doesn’t take too much climbing (or long on a train) to reach a breathtaking view. Agriculture is also a huge part of Yamanashi’s culture – it is known for its fruit production, and some of the first wineries in Japan were opened in Yamanashi. I am a big fan of local produce and living simply, but I doubt I would have been able to try this in Japan if I had been placed in a more urban location. How studying at Cambridge made all this possibleIf it wasn't for Cambridge, I'm not sure I would have been able to take on this role. I might not even have known about the CIR position - I signed up for the Careers Service, and discovered this programme while looking for positions related to Japan. However, Cambridge also prepared me in many ways I didn't even realise until I began the job. Cambridge has a strong language focus during the first year, which many students find challenging – but it secures the foundations of the language early on in your studies, building on top of them for easier understanding and consolidation in second year. I set out to Kyoto in my third year with a good grasp of the language – enough that I could navigate, but still at a level where I could take full advantage of immersion. I cannot stress the importance of the year abroad enough. If I had not lived in Japan before working as a CIR, I would have found it incredibly difficult. The year abroad doesn't just let you use and learn the language in a real setting. By living in Japan, you learn first hand about Japanese life, its culture and the people. I had so many opportunities, sitting the JLPT N2 and working several part-time jobs, which gave me both the hard qualifications for my JET application and the experience of working in Japan. And separate from the course itself, my teachers at Cambridge were all extremely helpful, supportive and considerate, particularly when it came to my application and my interview. Dr Kawabata, the Senior Language Teaching Officer in Japanese took time out of her schedule to do practice interviews with me, which was probably the best preparation I could have had. I am incredibly grateful that I was able to study on such an excellent course, with such fantastic teachers. A few last remarksFor people who want to work in Japan after graduation, and who would like a challenge, I would definitely recommend applying for JET as a CIR. The program is well regarded, and every person’s experience is unique. Opportunities to go and work in Japan as a foreigner straight out of university are few, particularly in this kind of role. The experience is very valuable, and I have learnt so much in a very short amount of time. If you are interested, definitely apply and see how it goes – and come and visit Yamanashi Prefecture if you can!© 2017 University of Cambridge

At that point, I could not have guessed that I would carry on beyond an undergraduate degree. The first year was an intense and effective introduction to modern Japanese grammar and East Asian History. At the start of second year, we had the chance to choose between several courses, and encouraged by the promise that “Classical Japanese is not boring!” I went along to the first class, and was immediately hooked. After the stately 13th century Tales of a Ten Foot Hut, we moved onto the far earthier Fake Tales of Ise—an impishly clever direct parody of the famous Tales of Ise—and I had my first taste of Edo Period literature. At first, the term “Premodern literature” might not seem like it will be a thrill a minute, but I soon found I was enthralled by each new text we covered. In our classes, I enjoyed the challenges of untangling ambiguous grammar, understanding and translating the humour of the texts, and being able to engage with “real” Premodern Japanese literature without the feeling of slogging through a textbook. It was wonderful to be told that the main goal of the course was not simply to get high marks in exams, but to experience as wide a range of genres and periods as we could. The weird and wonderful world of hentaigana and kuzushijiPart way through this year I was able to join a small reading group where we learnt how to read original woodblock printed texts from the Edo Period. It was exciting to encounter these texts “in the flesh”, and not in edited, annotated critical editions. I was apprehensive at first—would it be possible to decipher the beautiful but seemingly-incomprehensible cursive kanji (kuzushiji meaning Chinese characters that are literally “collapsed” or “crumbled”) and the bewildering squiggles of hentaigana (Alternate or “anomalous” renderings of the Japanese kana)? I needn’t have worried. Often, after scouring through dictionaries, the character would leap off the page, and there was a huge satisfaction in having solved the riddle. At times, we would all be scratching our heads, thinking, “it could be this… but maybe it’s this…maybe we can’t work this out”, and that was ok. Sometimes we have to accept that there is no clear-cut answer, and this was a surprisingly liberating revelation. In another group we had the opportunity to work with scholars from institutions across the world to read virtually unknown texts, and collaborate to produce high-quality annotated transcriptions. It was through these groups that I began to experience the trials and tribulations of research using real Edo Period texts. Anthropomorphised bottoms, and other curiositiesIn my third year, as I headed off for a year abroad in Kyoto, ideas were bubbling up for an undergraduate dissertation that could combine my budding interest in Edo Period literature with my long-held interest in translation theory. Together with my supervisor, we decided I would work on a mid-19th century illustrated hanashibon (“book of jests”) that featured personified proverbs, creating fanciful origin stories for them and punning incessantly on them. It was a great opportunity to try out my hentaigana reading and transcription skills—I was lucky enough to be given the use of a version of the precious original texts—and also made for an interesting discussion about the concept of untranslatability. Unsurprisingly, there’s no good way to translate a proverb about courtesan with a bottom for a face. It feels like no mean feat to write a thesis, but I was well-supported throughout and at the end of my final year, I had produced a thesis of which I could be proud (see fig. 1).        Fig. 1  Diving into graduate studiesAs I neared the end of the undergraduate degree, it became increasingly apparent that I might have the chance to carry onto an MPhil degree. I was warmly encouraged to apply for further studies, and felt that to leave the “forest of books” (an Edo Period metaphor that my supervisor used, which left a strong impression, and has stayed with me for a long while) at this point would be a shame. I was accepted onto the MPhil research program to produce a dissertation that would focus on translating the wit of Santō Kyōden’s (1761-18) kibyōshi (literally, “yellow-covers”, a type of popular fiction that flourished in Edo at the turn of the 19th century). It was a very valuable year—not only did I have my first ever experience of producing an extended piece of research, I also had to learn to manage my time properly (a work in progress!) without relying on the structure of a class-based taught degree. I was enabled to hone my research skills, and encouraged to gain the confidence to work with a greater degree of independence. At the end of the year I had the exhilarating and slightly intimidating experience of defending my thesis before two established academics from outside the institution, exposing me to the constructive criticism needed to produce good research. Onwards and over The PondAs I progressed through the MPhil degree, I was given a great deal of support by members of the Faculty to find the best way to continue my research and education. I was introduced to potential supervisors at various institutions in the States with whom I might build up further fruitful working relationships, and helped to navigate the ins and outs of making a successful application. I feel incredibly fortunate to have begun my academic training at Cambridge, which gave me the fundamental skills necessary for the PhD programme in Japanese Literature that I have now joined at Columbia University in New York. Without the dedicated support of members of the Faculty I would never have looked beyond a first degree, let alone towards a career in academia.31 October 2016 © 2017 University of Cambridge

Japan was still so far away (a week on the trans-Siberian), there was no access to contemporary material, and no way of copying anything. There were zero students ahead of us and zero behind, so we felt like lonely pioneers. Still, I count myself fortunate in my wild choice (for it was considered close to madness at the time), because the study of the language and culture has absorbed my energies for a lifetime.After graduation, I tried airline management with Cathay Pacific for two years and quickly realised that I was not cut out for business. Back to Cambridge for a three-year PhD on Mori Ōgai (I was the only graduate student), and Tokyo University (another lonely place!) followed by my first academic job at Monash University in Melbourne, another world altogether where Japanese was already being taught to large classes at Junior School level. From there I went to Columbia, then Princeton, and then finally back to Cambridge in 1985, where there was a big job to do, putting the subject back on its feet after a series of savage cuts. Believe it or not, there was serious talk of closing Japanese Studies down completely in the mid 1980s.Not many students want to go into academia these days. I am not sure why, but I hope it is not that we have been bad role models. It is not for everyone, of course, but I would still recommend it for the few who are brave enough, or perhaps foolhardy enough, to trust that a job might possibly be forthcoming after years struggling through all that barbed wire, as someone once said to me, trying to describe what Japanese looked like to the uninitiated.March 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

During a 10-year career break from the financial industry I trained as a chef, ran a small catering business for 8 years, wrote a cook book and kept up my passion for Japan through consulting work giving seminars on Japanese culture in the business world.Since May 2015 I have been working at SMBC Nikko Capital Markets, London in the Corporate Access department and was recently made head of the team. I accompany Japanese Corporate Management on Investor Relations roadshows in London and EU cities, brief them on institutional investors, attend meetings, provide feedback to the Equity Sales Team. I manage a team of 6 people who arrange IR roadshows and pitch mandate advice to our Tokyo counterparts.I was definitely not top of the class in my studies at the Faculty but found the course provided a very good grounding in spoken and written Japanese as well as in depth study of specific aspects of Japan. My main ambition after graduating was to get to Japan as soon as possible to further develop the skills that my degree had given me. The financial industry provided excellent opportunities for me to use these skills, to develop others as well and resulted in a very fulfilling career so far. Even during my career break when I took up cooking in earnest, Japanese cuisine dominated my menus!My main observation would be that there is still a solid need for speakers of Japanese in the financial industry today but sadly relatively few graduates. As the Japanese economy has been lacklustre during Japan's "lost decades," there has been limited recruitment of new blood, especially at non-Japanese firms, leaving something of a vacuum in terms of new young talent to replace the old guard who are now approaching retirement. With that in mind I would highly recommend pursuing a degree in Japanese Studies.January, 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

Congratulations, Sven! Could you tell me about your new job? What does it entail?I am currently the international strategy director at the Japanese arm of the global advertising agency MullenLowe. What that actually means is that I oversee all the projects in Tokyo that involve bridging culture between Japan and the rest of the world. This can mean helping to find the right angle on how to talk about beauty in Japan for a foreign shampoo brand or helping a Japanese manufacturer find the right way to tell its story abroad. While the world is becoming more and more globally uniform, there is still considerable power in brands communicating not just in a foreign language but through local culture. It is only in that way that a brand can tug at the heartstrings of its consumers. You only graduated in 2010, and I remember that you had plans to do a Master’s degree in Japan. So, your career has progressed rapidly, even though it was not perhaps what you had initially planned. Could you tell us about it? I came to Japan shortly after the earthquake that shook Tohoku in 2011 to study for a Master’s degree at Tokyo University. Due to the immense cost of the disaster, scholarships were suddenly cut and I was no longer able to simply rely on the scholarship to keep afloat. Through the Cambridge Careers Website, I saw an opening at a research and strategy consultancy in Tokyo and applied immediately. I was offered a job a week later and kept pursuing my Master’s degree at the same time as working as a cultural researcher.The company was going through a rough time as the world economy was focusing on the opportunities presented by growth in China. China seemed like a better place to put your bets on. It had just become the second largest economy – overtaking Japan – while Japan was grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake, rising national debt, shrinking population and a high yen. It just didn’t make sense for multinationals to spend their research budgets on Japan. The boutique consultancy was not doing well and within a year of joining the team shrank to just three employees.I needed to choose to concentrate on either my degree or my job. I wasn’t really enjoying the experience of being at Tokyo University, and I was certain that my career path was going to lie in business. What I loved about my academic years was learning and coming up with theories of why social systems work the way they do, and working for a cultural research agency allowed me to do just that.I decided to drop out of Tokyo University just six months before graduating to commit to my career. Difficult choices have a tendency to pay off and so, as the business picked up, I was able to grow with the company. In just three years I was an associate director leading large-scale research projects that led to some very successful results for my clients.Through a mix of luck and making the right decisions along the way, I helped MullenLowe win a large account, which allowed me to move to them into a senior position.But that is not to say that I have turned my back on academia, as it remains the only true space where you can deepen your understanding of a given subject without the distractions of business needs. As such, I am now also an adjunct professor at Keio University, teaching branding and market entry strategy to undergraduates, which allows me to marry practice with theory. Apart from language and knowledge about Japan, could you tell us what else you learned at Cambridge that was useful for your career?I found my time at Cambridge immensely valuable in so many different ways. Sure, learning the language helps but it was more than anything the opportunity to spend time with immensely intelligent people (from teaching faculty right through to fellow students) that helped shape the way I see Japan and find my personal view on how things work.Studying at Cambridge is hard. You are inundated with more work than you have experienced before. It sometimes feels like your back will break under the load but believe me, that is a good thing. It teaches you how to prioritise, juggle, how to focus and how to structure. These skills are essential for anything you want to do in life and no ‘how to’ book can teach you.But even beyond the classroom, Cambridge is a surprisingly good model of the real world. It’s a student ecosystem that echoes everything you experience in life afterwards, but in a more bitesize fashion. This can be the politics of the Cambridge Union, the journalism and business of the newspapers, the friendships, and also the animosities. It’s simply training for how to conduct your life thereafter. Throw yourself into it and see what comes of it. Is there anything you would like to tell young people who are thinking of applying to enrol in Japanese Studies at Cambridge? Any advice you want to give to your kōhai?Japanese Studies is not for the faint-hearted. You are doing a complete degree with an immensely challenging language on top. This means you have to commit wholeheartedly to the challenge ahead. Read around the subject. The faculty can provide excellent recommendations for what books to read (through it I discovered the incredible author Tanizaki Junichiro and also Mishima Yukio!). Learning Japanese before enrolling can give you an upper hand as a lot of the first year is spent on language acquisition. Certainly, getting the basics of the syllabic writing system out of the way before arriving helps!A degree in Japanese Studies doesn’t have to end up with a career in Japan. Actually, many of my fellow students did not make Japan their home. As the degree is wonderfully broad (Literature, Politics, History, Sociology etc.), the degree allows you to discover yourself over the span of the four years.Being one of the smallest degree programmes in the university, you will grow very close to your lecturers and fellow students. You are part of a family of people driven by passion. I have found that to be a real strength of Japanese Studies. You can easily approach your lecturers when you have questions, and amongst the students there is a sense of camaraderie that you don’t see as much in other subjects.Japan remains one of the most fascinating cultures. It is full of quirks and oddities and never ceases to amuse and amaze. With a history that is intricate and rich, and a unique art and design history that has produced some of the greatest works humanity has created, learning about Japan is simply an enriching experience.Questions asked by Brigitte Steger, November 2016© 2017 University of Cambridge

Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge offers students the opportunity to study some of the most complex and interesting political issues of our times, whilst also giving them access to some of the most beautiful poetry in history, conveyed through some of the richest language systems in the world.The BA in Middle Eastern Studies (MES) is distinctive for the range of language and subject combinations you can choose. Our aim is to provide you with extensive language abilities in one or more language spoken in the Middle East, to teach you the methods and styles of scholarly disciplines, and to further your understanding of the region through its history, politics, cultures, philosophies, and literatures. The skills you will obtain whilst studying for the BA open up a wide range of career options and the knowledge and experiences you acquire open up your mind.Many students choose to combine MES with learning a European language through the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages (MML). As you learn a Middle Eastern language from scratch, you can continue in a language you’re already familiar with. A combined degree in MES and MML offers access to a wide variety of paper choices, including topics in linguistics, comparative literature, and Audio Visual Media.The year abroad in your third year is where all that book learning comes to life. Living in a place, speaking the language, and conducting research in the language provides students the chance to obtain a deeper level of knowledge and appreciation for the cultures and histories of the region. The year abroad requires you to put what you’ve learned to use in a totally new environment. During at least eight months of your third year you will study, maybe work or volunteer, make new friends, and consolidate your language skills in the Middle East. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.The Department of Middle Eastern Studies holds Undergraduate Open Days in mid-March and early July each year. The Open Day provides an excellent opportunity for you and your parents to meet academic staff from the Department and to ask any questions that you might have about our courses.Further information about postgraduate courses at the Department may be found in our Graduate Studies section.© 2017 University of Cambridge

That includes Morocco, Mauritania and Western Sahara in the West, and stretches to Iraq, the Gulf states and Somalia in the East. It is the official language in 26 countries, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is also the sacred language of around 1.5 billion Muslims across the world, and the language in which some of the world's greatest works of literature, science, and history have been written.According to the teachings of Islam, Classical Arabic is the language in which Allah chose to speak to humankind through Prophet
An Arabic-Persian dictionary, 19th-century, Central Asia, bought in Bukhara, end of XXe century. Private collection of Christine van Ruymbeke. 
 Muhammad in the 7th century of the Christian era. It is the language of the Qur'an, Islam's holy book. This is the language of Islamic and classical texts. Modern Standard Arabic is the language of books and news broadcasts, poetry and political speeches across the whole Arab world, the language that every Arab primary school child learns to read and write in. It is the ever versatile language of the Arabic poetical tradition, the precise language of the jurists and the theologians, the dazzling rhetoric of the orators and the preachers, and the lingua franca of the internet. Knowing Arabic gives an opportunity to communicate with people throughout the Middle East, and provides access to the the richness and passion of the contemporary Arab world. Arabic is the means for exploring almost 14 centuries of one of the most sophisticated, varied, and rich intellectual heritages in the world.However, nobody speaks Standard Arabic as their native language. They learn it at school, but the mother tongue of a native Arabic speaker is the dialect of their own country—and even that of the specific region of their country. The Cambridge classroom attempts to mirror the Arab world, using Egyptian dialect to speak and Standard Arabic to read and write. Egyptian has the advantage of being a central dialect that Arabs from other parts can readily understand, and which can easily be adapted to speaking in other dialects. When students spend their year in the Middle East, they come back speaking the dialect of whichever country they have chosen to spend their time in, so that the fourth-year language classroom, like the Arab world itself, is a mix of dialects. Just as Standard Arabic gives access to the thought and literature of the Arabs, so the dialects give access to all the vitality and warmth of their everyday lives.© 2017 University of Cambridge

These have included business, diplomacy, industry, teaching, academic research, work with charities, NGOs and international organisations, public policy work, journalism, consulting and publishing, to name only a few. Others have gone on to pursue further professional qualifications in law or accountancy, for example.The Cambridge degree programme gives graduates access to many rare opportunities. Arabic studies in particular turns graduates  into highly desirable job candidates in a range of professions. Graduates with Arabic skills are often sought by governmental and private sectors. Former students have gone on to work with international banks, pursue higher degrees in the United States and the UK, conduct ethnographic field work in political hot-spots, work as a journalist with internationally renowned news agencies, and teach kids in North Africa.In addition to the world of work, many have found that acquiring a Middle Eastern language opened up a lifetime of possibilities of travel, friendship and cultural acquaintance.Career profiles of some of our recent graduates are listed below."Since graduating in 2011 with a BA in Oriental Studies, I have continued to work on the Middle East, completing an MPhil in Social Anthropology before moving to the London School of Economics to begin a PhD on Political Engagement in Lebanon. I am currently in Beirut conducting fieldwork."AMES (Hebrew and Arabic), King’s College, 2013 Graduate. "I am currently a Fulbright Masters Candidate at the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University. I can see the incredibly strong language skills I have built up over the past years in comparison to others, especially in reading and writing (though there is still much room for improvement). At Harvard I am expanding my academic research skills, which I feel were well established in Cambridge, with more qualitative research skills. At the moment I am attending a fieldwork research course with Harvard in Jordan on the Syrian Refugee Crisis. This coming summer I am likely to follow up with the projects I am now working on, either in Jordan or Lebanon." © 2017 University of Cambridge

Options for combining study of the Arabic language with a Modern Language are outlined [here]. In your second year, the following papers are offered as part of the BA in Middle Eastern Studies: Intermediate Arabic, Literary Arabic, The Formation of Islam, The Formation of the Middle East, and Contemporary Middle Eastern Politics and Society.You may combine a selection of these papers with other options from the Middle Eastern Studies Tripos offered by the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, the Department of Linguistics and the Faculty of Divinity. Options for continuing your Arabic language studies alongside papers from the Modern Languages Tripos are outlined [here]. The object of the year abroad is to greatly develop your competence in the language and your understanding of the society and culture within which it is used. It is also the time to start work on a dissertation, on a topic of your choosing within the range that the Department can supervise. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.If you are studying towards the BA in Middle Eastern Studies, you are normally required to spend eight months in a Middle Eastern country. If you are studying Arabic as a whole subject, you are required to spend eight months in an Arabic-speaking country. If you are combining Arabic with Persian or Hebrew, you are required to spend at least four months in an Arabic-speaking country and at least three months in Israel or Iran, or an equivalent deemed appropriate, unless you are from a Hebrew- or Persian-speaking background.If you are combining a Middle Eastern language with a Modern language, you are required to spend the full eight months in the Middle East. You are not required to spend any time in a country relevant to your European language.The countries our students spend the year abroad in vary, according to their inclinations and the political conditions in the Middle East. For example, in 2015 - 16 we have students in Jordan, Oman, the West Bank, Egypt, and Morocco. Students have spent their year abroad doing a wide range of things, from assisting in a school in a north Lebanese town, helping in a Palestinian theatre company, and volunteering at a hospital, to interning with an Egyptian human rights organisation, and working with a sailing company in Oman.The two-year course in Part II consists of advanced-level language teaching, plus a number of special subject options. These options reflect the research interests of the teaching staff, and will give you an opportunity to study a particular subject within Arabic Studies at a high level of detail. A dissertation of 12,000 words, usually connected with your special subject paper, is also a requirement.© 2017 University of Cambridge

I had studied Spanish at school but Arabic was a complete stab in the dark. Luckily it was a stab right on target, and by the end of first year I had decided to drop Spanish and move fully into FAMES, picking up Persian alongside Arabic. Studying Arabic is a completely new type of language learning experience. At first it can appear a formidable challenge, but it is also extremely refreshing. Arabic is a Semitic language and so its linguistic basis is entirely different to that of the European languages I was taught at school.The department is small - under 20 students of Arabic per year - and the workload is large. However if you ask any student of AMES whether they are happy to be there, it is a resounding yes. The small number of students means that classes are more relaxed, more intimate, and students develop friendships that rival those inside College. The workload is treated as part of the deal. You are starting a new language and want to come away fluent so there’s going to be a lot to learn. But the goals are realistic and you are never set irrelevant work.As a second year, I am currently planning for my Year Abroad next year. Once again, it is a daunting but terribly exciting prospect. I visited Jordan last summer with my fellow Arabic students and it was an eye-opening experience. This was my first trip to the Middle East since entering Cambridge and the ability to start communicating in Arabic was fantastic. It reminded us all of the importance of the language we were learning. Alongside the language papers, I am also taking papers in Arabic Literature and Middle Eastern politics and society. In the latter paper we have been examining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from an anthropological perspective. The work has really interested me and I am considering the possibility of focusing my year abroad research on a related topic. I hope to visit the refugee camps in the West Bank and examine how the conflict is viewed from the perspective of the camps’ inhabitants. As part of my previous study of Spanish, I spent a month in Mexico teaching children from the poorer parts of Mexico City. I hope to use this experience and interest to focus my dissertation on the impact of the conflict on children in the Palestinian camps. I’m currently planning a trip to the West Bank this Easter to do further research.It is an exciting prospect. I am aware that the guidance of my professors, and my increasing competence in the Arabic language, will make it all the more fulfilling and valuable."© 2017 University of Cambridge

It gives you not only access into a new world—people, places, culture, history, and world view—but also new perspective on the world you already know. This is true of learning any new language, but the effects are arguably more profound in the case of a language like Hebrew, both a vibrantly dynamic and amazingly flexible modern language of speech and culture and an ancient tongue whose writings are rich in history, artistry, and thought. Few modern languages can boast a literary repertoire as influential as Hebrew’s has been in the course of human history. And no ancient language has enjoyed more success at being revived as a mother tongue than Hebrew. Whatever your background, however much you may know or not know about Hebrew and its literature, whatever your interests in the language and culture of Israel, and whatever you may see yourself doing with this training in future, we invite you to consider entering into the world of Hebrew—in all its wealth, depth, and vitality.Documentation of the Hebrew language extends back 3,000 years or more, from the earliest inscriptions and biblical texts, down to the most recent Israeli songs, novels, and newspaper editions. It is the main language of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible, i.e., Old Testament), as well as of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which, since their initial discovery in 1947, have shed much light on a convulsive period in Jewish history in the late Second Commonwealth.After Biblical Hebrew a later form of the language was used by the early rabbis and sages in their voluminous writings, e.g., the Mishna, the Talmud, and midrashim (explanations of biblical texts), which are foundational to Judaism. In the Middle Ages Hebrew continued to be used by the great Jewish commentators on the Bible, and by poets, grammarians, and authors of many other works. Throughout, the language also, of course, served as a vehicle of Jewish prayer and worship, both at home and in the synagogue, and was a means of international communication between Jewish communities. Since the Renaissance and Reformation periods and up to the present day, Christians have also studied Hebrew. Finally, comatose as a widely-used mother tongue for some 1800 years, Hebrew was unprecedentedly reinvigorated as a spoken mother tongue in the nineteenth century. No longer just a liturgical and literary language, it rapidly became a vernacular in everyday use, and is now the most widely-employed language of the State of Israel, where it continues to develop, is used for all forms of communication, and where there is a vigorous and growing literature.Cambridge has long been a centre for Hebrew and Semitic studies, the Regius Professorship of Hebrew having been founded by Henry VIII in 1540. The University Library has a large number of Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, and special mention must be made of the famous Taylor-Schechter Genizah Collection. This collection contains thousands of manuscript fragments datable to the seventh century CE onwards. It attracts scholars from many parts of the world to work in Cambridge. Students wishing to learn about the Genizah enjoy guided access to the collection as well as expert supervision in their research.In three words, rigour, breadth, and flexibility. Taught in small groups by experts in the field, our students reach high levels in communicative and analytical stills. The Hebrew degree at FAMES takes four years, with the third year spent abroad. Along with general courses on Middle Eastern history and culture, students in the FAMES Hebrew programme study Hebrew language, literature, and culture of all periods (ancient, medieval, and modern). The teaching staff include specialists in each of these periods. It is our approach to integrate these historical layers of the language in a single coherent course. This gives the study of the modern language and literature a meaningful historical depth and the study of ancient Hebrew an added vitality. All students have the opportunity to study original medieval manuscripts from the Genizah. Topics covered in conjunction with the study of Modern Hebrew include the depiction of Israeli culture in the media, for example, changes in the depiction of the Haredim (ultra-orthodox) in film and television; the roots and development of Zionism; the presentation of gender in Hebrew literature; the birth and development of Modern Hebrew literature based on ancient strata and on the late pre-modern output of the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment) and the Tehiya (Revival).A student's third year in the Hebrew programme is spent in Israel. This is one of the most important components of the course, since it allows the student to be immersed in Israeli culture, to build on the linguistic knowledge acquired during the first two years in order to reach near-fluency in the language, and to conduct first-hand research on a research topic of their choice. For example, one recent student's 4th-year dissertation examined distinctive features in the Modern Hebrew speech of the Bedouins in Israel. The Hebrew Studies programme at Cambridge is, of course, excellent preparation for pursuing of more advanced degrees in Hebrew and Hebrew-related subjects (such as Bible, Religious Studies, Theology, Hebrew literature, history, and Middle Eastern Studies, and other Semitic languages, Arabic included), but as the language of a modern and thriving democracy of the Near East, it is also immensely useful as preparation for jobs in foreign relations, diplomacy, conflict resolution, development, translation, and journalism, as well as for work in non-profit and non-governmental organizations, experience which employers in all fields find attractive in prospective employees. Relative to the graduates of other universities and of other departments within the University of Cambridge, FAMES graduates consistently rank high in finding suitable employment in a variety of fields and/or being accepted into advanced degree courses after graduation.click on the links below for descriptions of the various combination and concentration tracks availableFull Hebrew PathHebrew and Arabic Language CombinationHebrew and Modern European Language CombinationHebrew and Persian Language EmphasisHebrew and Ancient Near Eastern Language EmphasisHebrew and Linguistics EmphasisHebrew and Jewish Studies EmphasisHebrew and Middle Eastern Studies EmphasisHebrew and Semitics Emphasis© 2017 University of Cambridge

Those leaving the university after their first degree have pursued careers in the private and public sector, including business, banking, the media, diplomacy and government. Some students have gone on to postgraduate studies and undertaken academic careers, becoming the next generation of scholars. Some students come to study Hebrew to explore their Jewish heritage, and end up working in the Jewish community as teachers or religious leaders. A Cambridge degree with a Hebrew concentration opens doors to people and experiences in Israel and beyond. Hebrew language teaching is a vibrant field, especially outside of Israel. Students of Hebrew find careers in academia and language pedagogy, as well as in the United Nations. Community organizations, such as interfaith groups, are always seeking members with Hebrew fluency. Learning Hebrew alongside another Middle Eastern language makes students ideal candidates for higher levels of research in politics, anthropology, and the history of the modern Middle East.© 2017 University of Cambridge

In the first year, this involved the intensive study of both the Biblical and the Modern language as well as courses which contextualised this within the wider cultural, historical and anthropological background of the Middle East. One thing that I am always grateful for at the Faculty is the flexibility that is shown, coupled - thanks to the excellent staff-student ratio - with high levels of investment and support for the individual interests and talents of the student. Within Hebrew studies, it is possible - even encouraged - to explore a wide range of complementary fields, which help to add depth to the core language and cultural courses taught within the Hebrew department. This can both take the form of inner-departmental courses on broader Middle Eastern topics, and external papers borrowed from other faculties.I also enjoyed the strong focus on literature during my time at AMES, which for me offers an inspiring lens through which to look at the social, political and historical elements that shaped the contours of Israeli society, as well as providing a more tangible grasp on the language in all its historical and formal depth.        My year abroad was spent in Jerusalem, an exciting, terrifying, and in many ways life-changing experience. I divided the year between studying at the Hebrew University and working for a charity, an organisation dedicated to teaching mentally-handicapped adults simple skills and providing a supportive environment in which they could work and realise their independence. The half-Hebrew, half-Arabic speaking workplace was often a challenge, but ultimately I found it a rewarding experience working with these incredibly generous and kind-hearted people.Now returning for my fourth year, I am looking towards pursuing my interest in linguistics through postgraduate study.  In the meantime, however, I’m taking courses in Hebrew literature, Zionism and Culture, and Comparative Semitic Linguistics, as well as writing a dissertation on the creation of the Hebrew folk song.”© 2017 University of Cambridge

The main languages offered are Arabic, Persian, Hindi and Hebrew, with papers on Akkadian and Egyptian offered through the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology. In recent years  students with a BA in Middle Eastern Studies have gone on to become lawyers, to work in the financial sector, in local government, publishing and in NGOs, among other areas.© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, there are two key differences that you should be aware of. At Cambridge, the application process starts earlier to allow time for interviews to be organized. You will also be asked to specify a College as well as naming your chosen degree subject in the application.In your College you will have a Director of Studies who will be responsible for your academic welfare and for your progress. In the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies supervisions are arranged by your teachers in the Faculty.
Dr. Yaron Peleg
Students studying Middle Eastern Studies and wondering which College to apply to should be aware that members of academic staff teaching about the Middle East are Fellows of the following Colleges. In some cases they also act as Director of Studies for all students in Middle Eastern Studies. In other Colleges your Director of Studies is likely to be a specialist in Asian Studies.In addition to talking to you about your personal statement, interviewers will want to know why you want to study the language on which you will be spending the next four years of your life (at least). Before your interview you should do some exploratory reading about the Middle East and be prepared to talk about your reading in the interview. This can include general histories, literature in translation, and other reading that relates to your main interest in the region. Wikipedia (which is not a trustworthy scholarly source) and other internet sources alone are not good enough!© 2017 University of Cambridge

At the moment I am attending a fieldwork research course with Harvard in Jordan on the Syrian Refugee Crisis."Elsien van Pinxteren,  AMES (Hebrew and Arabic), King’s College, 2013 Graduate."I started at Clare in 2007, studying for the Middle East and Islamic studies with Arabic BA. I'd come to Cambridge with very little experience in the language and history of the region, but with lots of questions about them that I wanted to find answers to. Studying in a small faculty like the Asian and Middle Eastern Studies faculty was perfect for that. All my lectures had such small numbers of people in them that it felt much more like a classroom, where open discussion dominated. I don't think friends in bigger faculties felt the same way. I also enjoyed the flexibility of the course, taking a few papers from elsewhere in the university, including the Theology faculty, which helped expose me to other disciplines and ways of approaching questions. Although there was enough work to mean that you never had an ‘empty plate’, I found plenty of time to get involved in other activities like sports. Since leaving Cambridge, I've joined the Foreign Office where I've continued to develop my Arabic. I've also gone on to do a Graduate Diploma in Economics in evening study at Birkbeck College, and am now doing an MSc in Economic policy at SOAS by correspondence, in which I’m combining my new economic studies with the regional and language expertise I gained during my BA.""I chose to study Arabic when I was 15 due to my opposition to and interest in the Iraq War. Exactly ten years later, I was rewarded for my hard work by being given the opportunity to work directly with Iraqis seeking asylum through the International Organization for Migration (IOM)'s resettlement programme. The job involved conducting interviews with three Iraqi families per day and recording both their biographical data as well as their persecution stories, all of this in Arabic and without interpreters.  I would never have been able to do this without the solid base in both Arabic and the history of the Middle East provided by FAMES at Cambridge. The faculty responded quickly to the changing needs and interests of students pursuing Arabic with Middle Eastern Studies by introducing modules on topical subjects like Political Islam, Human Rights in the Middle East, and Anthropology, which allowed students like me to undertake research that I was likely to use after university. The year abroad involved dizzying highs and lows, and in hindsight was one of the best things I have ever done. I chose Cambridge expressly because it was one of the only universities in the UK whose abroad programme was for the whole academic year, and which allowed students the flexibility of choosing where to go and what to do. In my case, this meant I was able to take a course in dressmaking alongside my language studies in Damascus.  I am now based in Jordan and continue to work with IOM on assistance to Syrian refugees. I have witnessed first hand the competitive edge that having a good level of Arabic proffers in this sector and part of the world, and am still grateful to my teachers and professors for insisting in equal measure on written and spoken Arabic. Although my career path may seem straightforward, I took a circuitous route getting here and it was not always apparent how I would apply my studies to the real world. Therefore the best advice I can give anyone is to stick to the language even when it seems impossibly tough, and to be true to your interests, because eventually you will find the right fit.  I have kept in touch with almost all of my teachers, who continue to offer invaluable guidance and encouragement. Likewise, I formed close ties with my year and we are still a tight group, bumping into each other regularly in different parts of the Middle East and, when we can, in the UK."Arianna Dini, AMES (Arabic)© 2017 University of Cambridge

web browser if you wish but then our site may not work correctly.Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern StudiesStudying at CambridgeThe qualifications required to do a BA in Middle Eastern Studies are not strictly defined. Arabic, Persian and Hebrew are all taught from scratch at Cambridge, so the course requires no prior knowledge of any of these languages. Students who wish to combine Middle Eastern Studies with a modern European language must have an 'A' level in their chosen European language. Please note that native speakers of one of the Middle Eastern Studies languages may not focus on that language as part of their BA studies.Our student intake for the course does vary, but on average we admit twenty undergraduates each year.The course is four years in duration, and is divided into two parts. Part I, lasting two years, will provide you with a thorough grounding in reading, writing, and speaking at least one Middle Eastern language and in the history and culture of the Middle East.The Tripos system is very flexible, and allows you to combine Middle Eastern Studies with a modern European language throughout your BA. You may also  change subject after completing Part I, either to study a completely unrelated subject, or to shift the emphasis within Middle Eastern Studies. For example, if you have combined languages in Part I you have the option of taking different proportions of either language in Part II, or of dropping one completely to concentrate on the other. Similarly, if you combine with a modern European language at Part I, you can continue to do so during Part II, or you can concentrate more on one or the other language.One of the distinctive strengths of Cambridge teaching is the supervision system, in which you have the opportunity to test out your ideas with a member of academic staff. This is a critical part of the pedagogical process, and we expect you to participate in a genuine dialogue in which you should challenge us as much as we, inevitably, will challenge you. In the first year you will have supervisions for language and for history, usually in pairs or small groups.During your first year, you will be given a thorough grounding in your chosen language(s), along with a general introduction to the history and culture of the Middle East. You will prepare for examination in four subject areas at the end of the year.Languages offered for study through the Department of Middle Eastern Studies are Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Biblical Hebrew and Modern Hebrew. Papers on Akkadian and Egyptian are also offered through the Department of Archaeology and Anthroplogy. If you study Arabic, Persian or Modern Hebrew in your first year, you will also prepare for an oral examination in that language. In addition to language study, you will need to choose at least one of the following papers: Introduction to the History and Culture of the Middle East or Introduction to the Contemporary Middle East.In your second year, you will continue with more detailed study in at least one of your chosen languages. You will have an oral exam if you study Arabic, Persian or Modern Hebrew. While enhancing your knowledge of the language through the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, you can also take classes in literature — reading texts in their original language — as well as classes in the history and culture of the region.If you wish to broaden your horizons yet further, three papers are available to you in the Department of Linguistics in the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages. Papers on Modern Judaism and Islam are also offered through the Faculty of Divinity.You will prepare for examinations in five subject areas at the end of your second year.The Year Abroad is one of the most rewarding parts of the degree course, where you have a chance to explore the language, society and culture of the Middle East for yourself. To encourage this exploration, you will choose how and where to spend your Year Abroad, as long as the country you choose is safe at the time, and you are spending the year doing something structured that involves considerable use of Arabic, Hebrew or Persian.All Middle Eastern Studies students, including those combining this with a European language, must spend at least eight months in the Middle East. They have another seven months between the end of their second year and the beginning of their fourth to spend where they wish. All students must spend at least two months following a structured course in the language they are studying, at one of a number of approved institutions in different countries, and some may spend the whole year doing this. There may also be the option of spending some of the year doing some sort of internship or voluntary work, alongside some private tuition in the language subject to Faculty Board approval. Some follow a university course (if approved by Cambridge University) that is taught to local students in the local language. This might have you learning Islam and Middle Eastern politics in Arabic, Persian literature in Farsi or Israeli literature in Hebrew. Students make their arrangements themselves, but the Department provides a great deal of information, support, and advice. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.As well as improving your language knowledge and getting a better feel for the culture and society, the Year Abroad allows you to gather material for a dissertation on a topic of your own choosing during the year, to be written up in your fourth year. You will receive guidance on this both before and during the year abroad. The dissertation mark counts double, so students start developing ideas for their research projects in second year. There is no requirement for you to take or pass exams or follow specific courses of study during the year abroad. What you achieve over the year is examined in your fourth year in your oral exam, your dissertation, and the way the knowledge and experience you have gained give breadth and depth to your other studies.More detailed information about the year abroad is given in each language area.Your final year comprises further advanced-level language work, plus special papers in fields of your interest. A major focus of the fourth year is writing a dissertation in close consultation with your supervisor. Final year courses offer in-depth perspectives on particular aspects of literature, history, anthropology, translation, and Islamic philosophy. © 2017 University of Cambridge

However if you ask any student of AMES whether they are happy to be there, it is a resounding yes."Katie Polglase, Part IB Arabic Studies "The Cambridge course also gives you the opportunity to set the boundaries of your own studies at many other points.

It is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan and counts more than 100 million speakers around the world. In the early modern period, Persian was the lingua franca for the educated élite in the Indian sub-continent, the language of the Moghul rulers of northern India and the vehicle for Moghul literature. It is still taught in many universities in India and Pakistan.Persian is perhaps most famous for its poetry; its fine epic and lyric poetry earmark it as one of the great canons of world literature. Great Persian poets like Omar Khayyam, Hafiz, Sa'di and Rumi have been beloved by Europeans reading their words in translation for over two hundred years: to read these poets in the original only adds to their depth and beauty. Persian is also the second language of Islam with many important works of history, literature, philosophy and Sufism (Islamic mysticism). Like true masterpieces, these works keep their appeal; their depth, scope and wit continue to fascinate us, opening vistas on the societies they address and reflect.Students of Persian benefit from the fact that the written and spoken forms of the language are close and have remained relatively constant over time. Students of Farsi are quickly able to communicate with the native speakers and to read a range of classical and modern materials.In our language classes, students will learn standard spoken of Persian (the form spoken in Tehran) and written Persian.During the year abroad, students spend some months studying in Iran in order to develop their language skills as well as learning more about Iranian culture and society.Iran is a key country in the Middle East and to know Persian is essential for those who want to be involved in this part of the world. You can become a translator, a journalist, or work in broadcasting. There is always demand from diplomatic services. Because of the recent changes in the Middle East, many multinational companies are starting investing in Iran so there are lots of opportunities in banking, commerce, oil and gas, and other international companies for those knowing Persian and with specialist knowledge of Iran.Persian has been studied and taught at Cambridge for many years by eminent scholars including E G Browne, R A Nicholson and A J Arberry. As a result, Cambridge has excellent resources in Persian studies. We teach classical and modern Persian language and literature and several history courses that cover Iran's history since the Islamic conquest to the twentieth century.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Options for combining study of the Persian language with a Modern Language are outlined [here].In your second year, the following papers are offered as part of the BA in Middle Eastern Studies: Intermediate Persian, Literary Persian, The Formation of Islam, The Formation of the Middle East and Contemporary Middle Eastern Politics and Society.You may combine a selection of these papers with other options from the Middle Eastern Studies Tripos offered by the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, the Department of Linguistics and the Faculty of Divinity. Options for continuing your Persian language studies alongside papers from the Modern Languages Tripos are outlined [here]. The object of the year abroad is to greatly develop your competence in the language and your understanding of the society and culture within which it is used. It is also the time to start work on a dissertation, on a topic of your choosing within the range that the Department can supervise. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.If you are studying towards the BA in Middle Eastern Studies, you are normally required to spend eight months in a Middle Eastern country. If you are studying Persian as a whole subject, you are required to spend eight months in a Persian-speaking country. If you are combining Persian with Arabic or Hebrew, you are required to spend at least four months in an Arabic-speaking country and at least three months in Israel or Iran, or an equivalent deemed appropriate, unless you are from a Hebrew- or Persian-speaking background.Most commonly, students spend three months at a university in Iran, either Tehran or Esfahan. It is often hard to get a visa for more than three months, and students combining with Arabic or Hebrew spend the rest of the year in a country relevant to those languages. Occasionally, entry into Iran is impossible, so students then spend time in Tajikistan, or sometimes study Persian elsewhere.If you are combining a Middle Eastern language with a Modern language, you are normally required to spend the full eight months in the Middle East. You are not required to spend any time in a country relevant to your European language.The two-year course in Part II consists of advanced-level language teaching, plus a number of special subject options. These options reflect the research interests of the teaching staff, and will give you an opportunity to study a particular subject within Persian Studies at a high level of detail. A dissertation of 12,000 words, usually connected with your special subject paper, is also a requirement.© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, after starting in Cambridge I realised that the course had so much more to offer beyond helping me meet a personal challenge. By the final year of the course, the language component only comprises a sixth of the program. The rest is filled by incredibly diverse options. During my undergraduate studies, aside from Arabic language, I have been able to study social and political anthropology, pre-modern and modern history, literature, and religious studies, all in relation to the Middle East. Furthermore, upon discovering more about the richness of Iranian culture and history, I decided to take on Persian in my second year. Considering the close links between the Persian and Arab worlds, learning the two languages in tandem facilitates the entire enterprise and often provides interesting linguistic insights into both.The Cambridge course also gives you the opportunity to set the boundaries of your own studies at many other points. One of the reasons I applied to Cambridge was because of the Department’s unique approach to the year abroad that allows you to decide exactly how you want to spend the third year of the degree. As long as you are either enrolled in a language program or doing actual work in the context of an Arabic environment, you can go pretty much anywhere in the Middle East that is safe to go to. This was great for me, as I was able to go to Lebanon and learn Lebanese colloquial Arabic, the original purpose of my studies. I was able to mix language immersion while gaining valuable experiences that I can actually put on my CV, (such as volunteering to help people with mental disabilities or teaching English while living in a village in the Lebanese mountains), with more formal instruction, which ensured that I maintained and furthered my written Arabic. All of this took me travelling across Lebanon and I was able to have a bit of the ‘gap yah’ I never had.Although it is a distant prospect for any prospective undergraduate, the final-year dissertation does provide you with a truly exceptional chance to research and write up any topic that falls within the blissfully broad parameters of Middle Eastern studies. I am certainly not alone in saying that this is one of the highlights of the course and one of its most rewarding parts. I have been writing a comparison between the teaching of history in Iran and Saudi Arabia. As part of this research, I have translated school textbooks from both countries. The excellent language instruction in this department has made this nowhere near as daunting a task as it might sound.As we work toward finishing our degrees, my classmates and I are now applying for various jobs in the fields of journalism, business, the civil service, think tanks, NGOs, and for further study. Having studied the languages and societies of the Middle East at Cambridge means that many doors are open to us.”© 2017 University of Cambridge

While it is anticipated that the year abroad will continue to be a mandatory requirement of the course, the Faculty may not in future be able to offer the financial support it has done in the past.Students still have to pay some fees to their home university during the year abroad, but the government has set a cap on this for future students of 15% of the usual fees.The Student Loan Company  significantly increases the loan for students spending a year abroad (from up to £5,555 for students in Cambridge  to up to £6,600 for  students spending a year abroad next year) see https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/loans-and-grants and it also provides a means tested travel grant (3 journeys after the first £303 and help with essential expenses, medical insurance and visas) – see https://www.gov.uk/travel-grants-students-england/what-youll-get.In addition the Faculty provides a small amount of financial support – more if you have proven financial need.Arrangements for this year abroad vary according to the subject studied:Chinese StudiesJapanese StudiesMiddle Eastern Studies© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is perhaps worth emphasising that both programmes are the same in content and are taught by highly competent teachers. Beijing is the capital city of China, and Qingdao is a medium-sized city (according to the Chinese standard) located on the east coast of China.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Chinese Studies is Dr Boping Yuan.Airfares from London to Beijing currently run to about £800 for a round-trip ticket (although tickets may be found for lower prices by booking far in advance or not taking direct flights), and an air ticket from Beijing to Qingdao (one-hour flight) costs about £80. Tuition fees are paid directly to the Chinese university on behalf of the students. (plus a deposit (approx. one-month rent), water/electricity/heating bills, and a commission charge (approx. one-month rent) if via an agent.)Please note that it is students' own responsibility if they choose to usean agent for finding accommodation in Beijing rather than staying in the University accommodation.  (plus a deposit (approx. one month rent), water/electricity/heating bills, and a commission charge (approx. one-month rent) if via an agent. )Please note that it is students' own responsibility if they choose to use an agent for finding accommodation in Qingdao rather than staying in the University accommodation.Each student will have to obtain a resident permit from a local public security bureau within 30 days of their arrival in China, which may cost £50 for a permit within 12 months. Students should contact their chosen Chinese university first when preparing all documents for resident permit application.If students are travelling in China prior to starting their courses at university, they will still have to obtain a residence permit within 30 days of arrival. Students need to apply for an "X" visa. The "L" and "F" visa may not be changed to the "X" visa in China Students will be required to have a health examination (if they have not done so in their home country before going to China), which may cost approximately £50. The costs for food, travel, and daily necessities are relatively inexpensive and vary with individual students. Students are encouraged to talk to fourth year students who studied in China to get useful information from them.Students are encouraged to take out medical and travel insurance. They should also be made aware that visitors need a passport valid for six months after their date of departure before they will be able to apply for a visa.Students will be required to sign a form [download here] agreeing to pay the fee to the Chinese university in full upon arrival, agreeing to abide by the arrangements and agreeing to reimburse the Faculty should they discontinue the course after their return from China.The Study Abroad Coordinator, Dr Boping Yuan, will be happy to answer questions about the period abroad.Contacts and correspondence address:Ms. LI KeInternational Students Division Office of International RelationsRoom 335, New Sun Student Centre Peking University Beijing, 100871 People’s Republic of China Email: etolike@pku.edu.cn   Tel: +86-10-627-58203  Fax: +86-10-627-59754Contacts and correspondence address:Mr. CHEN Zhixi or Prof. NING Aihua International Education Centre Ocean University of China 23 Eastern Hong Kong Road Qingdao, 266071 The People’s Republic of China Email: iec@mail.ouc.edu.cn, <iec@ouc.edu.cn> or czx@ouc.edu.cnTel: +86-532-5901666,   +86-532-5901555 Fax: +86-532-5901868The courses at both Peking University and Ocean University of China start around the beginning of September and finish around the end of June in the following year. There are breaks for  Mid-Autumn Festival (one day in September), National Day (about one week at the beginning of October), New Year's Day (one day), Spring Festival/Winter Vacation (which usually lasts from the middle of January until the middle of February), Qingming Festival (one day in early April) and Dragon Boat Festival (one day in June). Please note that Christmas is not a public holiday in China and you would not be expected to leave at this time.  There are 15 hours of teaching per week at both Peking University and Ocean University of China:Dissertation guidance/advice (upon request)While studying in China, Cambridge students should abide by the Chinese university's rules and regulations (including the Chinese university's academic calendar, examination arrangements, etc.). Students must attend all classes and take all the examinations, unless they have good reasons not to do so. There are exams in the middle and at the end of both the autumn and spring semesters. Peking University and Ocean University of China send the University of Cambridge a report of each student's academic performance, class attendance and examination results for the courses.F.  FinancesStudents who choose to set up a bank account in China will need to provide both their passports and residence permits.1. Students should fill in an Application Form for Foreign Students Wishing to Study in Peking University/Ocean University of China, which can be downloaded at Peking University (www.isd.pku.edu.cn/upload/2012011201385163703757.doc) and  Ocean University of China (as a Word or PDF document)    The completed form must be handed to Dr. Boping Yuan no later than Tuesday, 24th April, 2018.  2. Peking University and Ocean University of China are expected to send each student, in June, a notice of admission and necessary documents for a successful visa application at the Chinese Embassy in London.  Students should then apply for the visa as soon as possible.3. The University will collect the tuition fee at 15% of the normal rate while the student is abroad.  In general, Colleges do not charge College fees for students of Chinese while they are abroad but it is the responsibility of the student to confirm this with their own college.4. Students eligible for tuition fee or maintenance loans who are spending the year overseas with the agreement of their institution may be entitled to an increased maintenance loan and the 15% of the regular tuition fee loan (paid directly to the home institution). Students should log into their student finance account to change the details of their next year's application (specifying that they will be living outside the UK for all three terms) as soon as possible to avoid late arrival of loan payments.Students' finance is a tutorial matter and is not dealt with by the Faculty. Students must be aware that it is their responsibility to ascertain what level of support they can obtain.5. It is also the student's own responsibility to secure a visa for China. The official website of the China Visa Application Service Center can be found at www.visaforchina.org6. Students are advised to take out medical insurance in their home country before going to China. Specialised "year abroad" packages for students are available from some insurers.Students preparing for their year abroad may find the following, student-written, guide to some of the practicalities helpful: Chinese YA Guide (your Raven password will be required to download this PDF file from outside the University).  Students can also go to the Faculty Library to read a similar guide written by a different year group (It is catalogued as “Reference only” and it is not borrowable).© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is a good private university situated in the north of the city. The main campus is bordered by the extensive grounds of Shokokuji to the east and the old Imperial Palace to the south.2 It is expected that the majority of students will take advantage of this arrangement, which is by and large hassle free and provides a good base in one of Japan’s most attractive cities. However, there are other options for spending a year in Japan. The MEXT Undergraduate Scholarship in Japanese Studies is a generous scholarship offered by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and offers undergraduates an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the language and culture of Japan through study at a Japanese university (recent successful applicants have studied at institutions such as: Doshisha, Hitotsubashi, Keio, Kyoto, Osaka and Sophia universities). Alternatively the Japanese Studies group is in the process of establishing internship opportunities with a number of Japanese businesses (available from 2018), for more information please check our internships page for regular updates. If a student wishes to make his or her own plans this is possible but it should be noted that a) a detailed plan must be agreed to by the Study-Abroad Coordinator before the end of January at the latest, and b) no administrative help can be expected.3 For those applying to Doshisha the first deadline is 31st January. At this point the Dept. sends CJLC a list of those students who wish to go to Doshisha.4 CJLC will then send the necessary application forms and other material to each student. From this point on, all correspondence (in English) is between CJLC and the student concerned, with copies being sent to the Dept. No individually tailored references are required. You will have to provide the signature of a UK ‘guarantor’ (who would normally be the parent or guardian, not the College), because the legal age for adulthood in Japan is not 18 but 20. Japanese Immigration also demands that in order to obtain a student visa you must be able to guarantee a minimum of ¥1,200,000 (approx £8,100 at October 2017 exchange rate £1 approx.= ¥148) to cover living expenses for one year. On receipt of your application CJLC then applies to Japanese Immigration for a Certificate of Eligibility (zairyu shikaku nintei shomeisho), the guarantor for which is CJLC. Once this is in hand, you can obtain your student visa. Note that unless special arrangements are made well in advance, visas can only be issued at the Consulate in London.5 Each document will have its own deadline clearly marked. Failure to keep to any one of these deadlines may jeopardise your acceptance. The responsibility is yours and yours alone.6 Fees:7 Cost of livingDoshisha has several hostels and their monthly rents including use of internet and all utility bills are between ¥35,000 (approx.= £240) and ¥45,000 (approx.= £300) for the year 2017 and 18. You will probably need another ¥80,000 (approx.= £540) per month for your food, local transport etc but remember that if you are short of cash you can always do some arubaito which will allow you not only to have some extra money but also give you opportunities to meet people and to experience Japanese life outside the university campus. In addition you have to pay for the National Health Insurance. A year coverage for the year 2016-17 was ¥17,346 (approx.= £120). Depending on courses you choose you may have to pay for some teaching material but the entire cost should not go over ¥25,000 (approx.= £170)Please note that the figures above are approximate and calculated with the exchange rate of £1 approx.= ¥148 (October 2017) and it may change.8 Arrival and DepartureYou are expected to arrive either on the 6th or 7th of September 2017. The final exams end in early August 2018. There is a closing ceremony in mid-September but this is not compulsory.9 Teaching: there are two semesters and fees are calculated in terms of credits. The tuition fee covers 20 credits (10 per semester), which means, in essence, language classes Mon–Fri. In addition, other courses are available in CJLC up to a further 10 credits free of charge. Anything over these 10 credits will be charged at the normal rate. There is no obligation to attend any classes taught in English. There will be plenty of opportunity to get involved in other activities and the library and other facilities will be made available.10 Students’ performance will be evaluated at the end of each semester in accordance with normal CJLC practice. It is a requirement for the purpose of the exchange agreement and visa status to participate fully in classes and tests. There will be a placement test on arrival, but this does not tie the student to that level for the whole year. If appropriate, it is possible to move to a higher level course for the second semester.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Japanese Studies is Dr Miki Kawabata.© 2017 University of Cambridge

To encourage this exploration students choose for themselves how and where to spend their Year Abroad, as long as the country they choose is safe at the time, and they are spending the year doing something structured which involves considerable use of Arabic, Hebrew or Persian. All Middle Eastern Studies students, including those combining this with a European language, must spend at least eight months in the Middle East. They have another seven months between the end of their second year and the beginning of their fourth to spend where they wish.Some students spend the whole year following a structured course in the language they are studying, but many these days do some sort of internship or voluntary work, alongside some private tuition in the language. Some follow a university course such as politics, literature or Islam, taught to the locals in the local language. Students make their arrangements themselves, with the Department providing information, support and advice.As well as improving their language knowledge and getting a better feel for the culture and society, students gather material for a dissertation on a topic of their own choosing during the year, to be written up in their fourth year. They get guidance on this both before and during the year abroad. There is no requirement for students to take or pass exams or follow specific courses of study during the year abroad. What they achieve over the year is examined in their fourth year in their oral exam, their dissertation, and the way the knowledge and experience they have gained give breadth and depth to their other studies.Arabic: The countries our students spend the year in vary, according to their inclinations and the political conditions in the Middle East. For example in 2013 – 14 we have students in Jordan, Oman, the West Bank, the Sudan and Morocco. They spend the year doing a wide range of things, from assisting in a school in a north Lebanese town to helping in a Palestinian theatre company or a hospital, to interning with an Egyptian human rights organisation or working with a sailing company in Oman.Hebrew: Most students spend the year at a major university in Israel at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa or Beer-Sheva. All of these universities have special programmes for overseas students, where they combine intensive language study with courses of their own choosing in subjects such as Israeli history, society, modern literature, Jewish thought, politics or Biblical studies. Some students do work or voluntary work instead, for some or all of the year.Persian: Students who are doing only Persian or combining Persian and an MML language spend their whole year abroad in Iran. Most commonly, students who are combining Persian with Arabic, or Hebrew spend three to four months at a university in Iran, particularly Tehran, Mashhad or Esfahan. All of these universities have special programmes for overseas students, where they combine intensive language study with literature courses. If for any reason students cannot obtain a visa to Iran they will spend their Year Abroad in Tajikistan where possible, or sometimes studying Persian somewhere else.The costs of the Year Abroad are very variable, depending on what a student chooses to do and where they choose to go. The costs below are approximate, based on current information.Worldwide travel insurance is available for around £200You will need to check with your local GP surgery what you will need. Most vaccinations are free of charge. For most Arabic-speaking countries you are likely to need typhoid, hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations. Anyone travelling to the Sudan will probably need vaccinating against meningitis (and there is likely to be a cost as only vaccination against meningitis C is free); anti-malarial medication is also likely to be necessary. You can buy this over the counter from a pharmacy.Cost of living: accommodation in Jordan away from the tourist areas can cost around £50 per month (including meals). In Morocco it is likely to cost between £80 and £150 per month, and up to £250 if meals are included.Food and other living expenses: in Jordan a cup of coffee is around 60p away from the tourist areas. In Morocco food costs vary, but are usually not very expensive. A cup of coffee is about 50p, a kilo of oranges could be 30p, you can eat a cheap bowl of lentils and bread and tea for 60p or a tagine for about £4. Getting around is also cheap, especially taxis. One student in Jordan commented ‘I would generally spend about 300 pounds a month, but more if I was sightseeing. Sightseeing and travelling around the touristy places, especially when I had people visiting from home, were by far my biggest costs.’Rial is Iranian official currency. But commonly people use the word Toman instead of Rial to express the amounts of money and prices of goods. The value of Toman is 10 times more than the value of Rial. For example 100 Rials is equal to 10 Tomans. So if a shirt is tagged 450,000 Rials, the clerk will say it is 45,000 Tomans.The exchange rate is usually unstable but at the moment one pound is equal to 47,000 Rials or as Iranians say 4,700 Tomans.Cost of living: accommodation provided by universities and Persian centres in Iran are about £150 to £200 per month.Food and other living expenses: It really depends on each individual. In Iran a cup of coffee can be around £3, though in the universities café it can be much cheaper around £1.5. In general food and restaurants are slightly cheaper than the UK. So depending on your life style in the UK, you may have to spend the same amount for food in Iran.Transportation is relatively cheap in Iran (except flights). In Tehran, the single bus tickets can be less than 20p and the hired taxi can start from £2. In the city it shouldn’t be more than £6 for long journeys. Underground/Metro in Tehran is a great means of transportation. A single trip is around 20p and a return can be around 30p. If you have a Metro credit card (which is something like Oyster card), the single fare can drop to 10p.The most popular Israel Shekel exchange rate is the ILS to USD rate, hence the dollars referred to below.Accommodation: $160/week (Hebrew University accommodation)Food: around 150 shekels/week (really depends on the person though). A pastry in a campus café is around 7 to 10 shekels. The cost of a coffee really depends on where you go - at the low end around 3 shekels in a campus café.Mobile phone: on contract $35/month (includes unlimited calling, texting and 3G data within Israel, and unlimited calling to UK)Transport: a light rail ticket costs 6.90 shekels (for unlimited usage within a 90 minute period on the light rail and Egged buses). A discount can be obtained by buying a student card.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Arabic Studies is Mrs Farida El-Keiy.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Hebrew Studies is Dr Aaron Hornkohl.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Persian Studies is Dr Mahbod Ghaffari.© 2017 University of Cambridge

All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarize themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has wide academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely.Applicants must have good reading skills in the language appropriate to their chosen topic. All applicants must have an excellent command of the English language (evidenced by the appropriate English-language test scores). The following two MPhil Pathway Options will be offered for the MPhil in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Hebrew Studies) for 2018 - 2019:Papers for the Cairo Genizah MPhil pathway include:1. The Cairo Genizah: Paleography and CodicologyThis module will open with an introduction that will cover the history of the Cairo Genizah, its scope and contents, its discovery by western scholars, the dispersal of its materials to "Genizah collections" in Europe and the United States, and their occasional re-discovery in these collections. The main focus of the module will be on the fundamentals of Hebrew codicology and paleography, especially as these two disciplines relate to the Genizah manuscripts. Students will be introduced to the main concepts underlying the production of Hebrew codices and other written formats in the medieval Middle East. They will also learn to recognize the main varieties of Hebrew script that are encountered in the Genizah.2. Genizah GenresIn this module students will read Genizah manuscripts of texts relating to selected genres. These will include documents and poetry. The aim is to expose students both to a selection of the primary text materials with which a given field operates and provide them with an introduction to the research current in the discipline on the basis of secondary literature. If students have a knowledge of Arabic, they will have the opportunity to read Judaeo-Arabic documentary texts.3. Genizah languagesIn conjunction with their choice of genre, each student will select a language of specialization. Alongside work with the chosen genre, the student will then undertake an advanced study of the language in which the genre is composed, viz. Medieval Hebrew or Judaeo-Arabic. This module has the aim of improving language skills as well as exposing the student to a sample of literature composed in the selected language beyond the material that is available in the Genizah.OR:Papers for the Modern Hebrew Culture MPhil pathway include:1. Historical PerspectivesAn introduction to the history of modern Hebrew literature and culture, their scope and contents, their development in Eastern Europe and eventual migration outside of Europe, primarily to the Land of Israel. The module examines a variety of representative works (literary, poetic, cinematic, aesthetic) from the last 150 or so years that highlight different aspects of the major changes that marked Jewish history and society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, primarily the breakdown of tradition and the transformation from a predominantly religious society in eastern Europe to the secular and more pluralistic culture of the State of Israel today.2. Thematic PerspectivesStudents in this module examine more closely specific themes that preoccupy Israeli literature, cinema or cultural production. The module looks at literature, cinema, or other modern Hebrew cultural products (language, music, visual culture, material culture etc.) as media that both reflect and shape it by focusing primarily on aspects of ideology and history. By focusing on a limited number of works that engage with one major issue or theme students develop a deeper understanding of Israeli culture and the various forces that shaped it.3. Generic VarietiesIn conjunction with the previous two modules and based on the materials in both students in this module explore major genres in modern Hebrew culture—literary, cinematic, aesthetic—and the challenges these genres posed for writers, film-makers and cultural innovators. The first part of the module consists of an introduction to generic varieties in modern Hebrew literature and culture in their historical context. In the second part of the module, each student selects one medium and genre and develops a deeper acquaintance and understanding of it based on primary materials as well as secondary readings (theoretical and critical). The aim of the module is to expose students both to the varieties of modern Hebrew cultural media and genres as well as give them an opportunity for more focused critical work. Applicants for both MPhil Pathway options must have a sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to read medieval Hebrew primary sources. Students must take each of the three papers listed in either of the two options offered and submit a 15,000 word dissertation in mid-August.The one-year MPhil in Hebrew Studies has the following structure:The dissertation provides an opportunity to learn the process of carrying out research and will help train students to be a future researcher (in academia or elsewhere). Applicants should consider carefully the formulation of a potential MPhil dissertation topic before applying. They should be in touch with members of staff who would act as supervisors before submitting the final version of their dissertation proposal.Applicants for the PhD will be expected to have scored at least 67% or above (or the equivalent from an overseas University) in their Master's degree which should be related to the PhD programme they wish to pursue. All applicants should submit with their GRADSAF (graduate application) a workable and interesting research proposal and demonstrate that they have the required academic knowledge and skills to carry out their project.Admission is at the discretion of the Degree Committee, which judges each graduate applicant on his or her own merits and in accordance with its own set rules and regulations. For further information about this course and how to apply, please refer to the following webpage(s) on the Graduate Admissions website:http://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/amammphbs© 2017 University of Cambridge

All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarize themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has wide academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely. For the avoidance of confusion, although this course is an MPhil with taught elements the Graduate Admissions website identifies it as predominantly research. This is the correct course for which to apply. Applicants for this course will be expected to have a University qualification in either Hebrew or Arabic. At present, the following modules are offered:Papers for the Muslim Jewish Relations MPhil Pathway include:1. Muslim-Jewish Relations, FoundationsThis module introduces students to the analytical tools required for studying Muslim-Jewish relations, primary sources in translation and original language, bibliographical method, objectivity in the study of interfaith relations and controversial themes. Themes may include the Jewish languages of the Islamic world, key historical documents in the study of Muslim-Jewish Relations; Jewish and Muslim thought; Law and Society; the Ottoman Empire, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.2. Muslim-Jewish Relations, Special TopicsThese topics will generally focus on contemporary issues between Muslims and Jews and why these relations are important to understanding the position of religious minorities, faith identity and politics in the Middle East and North Africa. Comparisons will be made to Europe and the United States in order to understand how trends in the region are related to politics and social change elsewhere. Topics may include: Religious Identity and Politics in the Middle East and North Africa; Globalization, Faith and Identity in the Middle East and North Africa, Europe and the United States; Comparative Perspectives on Muslim-Jewish Relations in Middle East and North Africa and Europe; the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab Spring.3. Cairo GenizahIn this module students are given an introduction to the Genizah manuscripts and its importance for the study of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Middle Ages. Most of the teaching will be based on a selection of Genizah texts in Hebrew or Judaeo-Arabic. These will be read in edited form and also from the original manuscripts in the Taylor-Schechter Genizah collection in Cambridge (www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor-Schechter/Introduction.html)OR from:(OPTION 2) Persian Cultural HistoryApplicants for this course are expected to have a university qualification in Persian.This course offers readings in Persian cultural history, identifying persisting trends in Persian literature and cultural production from the medieval period down to modern times. These themes revolve around kingship and the image of the ideal prince, theories of justice and good government, and competing sources of secular and religious authority. Similarly, the motif of love, both earthly and divine, is a common thread running through Persian literature and entails also the extensive use of imagery of the natural world. In the modern world, the course examines a number of issues by studying Iranian cinema and focusing on gender, historical adaptation, nation and approaches to narration and resistance to dominant discourses, reflecting also on how the stories and legends of the classical tradition are adapted for contemporary literature and media.In discussing these topics, attention is paid to their visual as well as written representation.At present, the following modules are offered:Papers for the Persian Cultural History MPhil Pathway include:This module introduces some key texts of historical and hagiographical literature, exploring their different literary and narrative approaches to addressing essentially the same purpose, namely establishing the legitimacy and idealised image of both the rulers and the saints who form their subject matter. Poetry plays a large part in the delivery and expression of these topics and the module concentrates on readings that explore the relationship between history, sufism and poetry in Persian culture.This module focuses on texts written for princes and monarchs, which are meant to shape the knowledge and morality of the people at the top. Texts picturing the pre-Islamic royal history, Mirror for Princes, didactic prose and poetry… all these participate in informing the understanding and political intelligence of young princes. The course also looks at the practical results achieved during the life time of the monarchs: art historical elements of courtly life and historical events are analysed and discussed.The purpose of this module is to introduce the students to different approaches to analyzing cinematic form and studying culture through films. Each session, therefore, includes watching and discussing a film and reading one or two critical texts that examine different aspects of life and film production in Iran. The key cultural concepts are gender relations, resistance against dominant discourses, historical and intercultural adaptation, nation and nationalism, and cinematic narration. The one-year MPhil in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) will have the following structure for the Muslim-Jewish Relations (OPTION 1) and Persian Cultural History (OPTION 2):The dissertation provides an opportunity to learn the process of carrying out research and will help train students to be a future researcher (in academia or elsewhere). Applicants should consider carefully the formulation of a potential MPhil dissertation topic before applying. They should be in touch with members of staff who would act as supervisors before submitting the final version of their dissertation proposal.Applicants for this course are expected to have a university qualification in either Hebrew or Arabic (Muslim-Jewish Relations stream) or Persian (Persian Cultural History stream).Applicants for the PhD will be expected to have scored at least 67% or above (or the equivalent from an overseas University) in their Master's degree which should be related to the PhD programme they wish to pursue. All applicants should submit with their GRADSAF (graduate application) a workable and interesting research proposal and demonstrate that they have the required academic knowledge and skills to carry out their project.Admission is at the discretion of the Degree Committee, which judges each graduate applicant on his or her own merits and in accordance with its own set rules and regulations. For further information about this course and how to apply, please refer to the following webpage(s) on the Graduate Admissions website:http://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/amammpmei© 2017 University of Cambridge

Many world-renowned scholars of China have taught here or were trained here. The University also has world-leading research resources in Chinese Studies (e.g. archival and library holdings, collaborations with colleagues and institutions worldwide). Today Chinese Studies at Cambridge encompasses diverse disciplines and expertise, ranging from textual scholarship to fieldwork-based socio-cultural anthropology, from paleography (the study of ancient manuscripts and inscriptions) to modern literature (even 'internet literature'), from ancient history to modern history, from archaeology to linguistics, from art history to politics. We believe that the training of the next generation of China scholars is one of our most important tasks, as the rise of China and the global recognition of the importance of Chinese civilisation mean that the world will need many more experts on China in diverse disciplines, not only to research and publish on the endlessly fascinating Chinese world but also to introduce the richness of Chinese civilisation to generations of young people all over the world through university-level teaching.We offer degree courses at both the MPhil and PhD levels. We encourage you to apply to pursue a PhD in Chinese Studies with us if you already have substantial background training related to your chosen topic and can work relatively independently (but of course with constant guidance from your PhD supervisor).The MPhil Programme in Chinese Studies is a specially-designed one-year research course with substantial taught elements, aimed at training budding scholars in theories and methodologies in various fields in Chinese Studies. We welcome applications from prospective students who have taken Chinese Studies as a major subject in a first degree programme or those who already have substantial Chinese-language abilities, who had undergraduate training in other subjects (e.g. literature, history, anthropology, art history, music, archaeology, classics, politics, etc.), but who wish to consider switching to Chinese Studies for their future career (in the latter case the MPhil in Chinese Studies can serve as a so-called 'conversion course').Please browse through the Chinese Studies staff and graduate student profiles and their current research projects to find out more.Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation. This is essential especially if you are applying to the PhD programme since your proposed project has to be within the range of research expertise and interest of the supervisor. All graduate students in Chinese Studies are attached to the China Studies Research Group. Further information about the Group's projects and activities is available on our Research pages.© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is designed for highly-motivated future researchers who have a substantial undergraduate background in Chinese Studies or related fields but need more exposure to topic-specific or discipline-based analytical frameworks and more intense training in primary source language(s) and research skills. All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarise themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has much wider academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely. Do not feel obliged to find a topic that caters to the specific interest of potential supervisors.Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation (sometimes a staff member will be on sabbatical or research leave and cannot take on any new research student during that year). Applicants with a substantial training in the relevant skills and with a very specific research interest are advised to consult with individual staff members to explore the possibility of doing a MPhil in Chinese Studies ‘by dissertation only’. Those who do 'dissertation only' will write a longer dissertation (up to 25,000 words) and the assessment includes an oral examination of the dissertation (viva).All applications for graduate study at the University are made online via the Graduate Admissions Office (GAO). Applicants should ensure that they are familiar with the admission requirements.Please note that any applications submitted before the beginning of January, with the exception of those applying for Gates US funding, will be reviewed as a gathered field.  You will therefore not receive a decision on your application until the beginning of February.  Applications submitted after the beginning of January will be reviewed within the normal guidelines.Applicants must already have good reading skills in the Chinese language, though a student can choose to enhance his or her skills in reading and interpreting texts specific to a particular topic (more on this below). For those whose interests are in pre-modern, medieval or early China, at least two years of experience of literary Chinese (文言文) is essential.Those applicants who are not native speakers of English must have an excellent command of the English language (evidenced by the appropriate English-language test scores). If you have performed exceptionally well in your undergraduate degree (including a high GPA) you should have a decent chance of getting a scholarship to cover the cost of your MPhil studies. A number of of our past and current MPhil students have been funded by scholarships. We encourage you to explore widely various funding opportunities, including those that are based in specific countries and are for nationals of those countries (e.g. Gates US for US nationals, China Scholarship Council for Chinese nationals, Cambridge-Taiwan for Taiwanese nationals, etc.). If you are not a native speaker of English your chance of being considered for a scholarship would be greater if you had IELTS scores considerably higher than the minimum that Cambridge requires for postgraduate studies (currently 7.5 average and above 7 in all sections).Please note that if you are not a native speaker of English your chance of being offered a place in our MPhil programme would be reduced if you did not supply, upon applying, IELTS results that already satisfy the above-mentioned Cambridge postgraduate admissions requirement.

For example, one recent MPhil student who is a non-native speaker of Chinese was working on contemporary Chinese art and elected to work intensively on improving her readings skills in Chinese-language texts relating to her dissertation topic (involving meeting with her supervisor every week to translate and discuss a wide range of texts) and this constituted one of her two option papers (as a specially-arranged 'alternative exercise') (see above for the MPhil course structure and paper options). Students can also audit advanced undergraduate text-reading and liteary Chinese classes. Many other venues in Cambridge provide excellent opportunities for improving one's Chinese-language skills, e.g. the Friday text-reading seminars at the Needham Institute (primarily texts in literary Chinese), student-organised readings of Chinese classics, the Cambridge University Language Centre, language-exchange partnerships, etc.Even though your dissertation (up to 15,000 words) needs to be a piece of original research with fresh insights, it is not supposed to be a magnum opus. One should understand the process of researching and writing the MPhil dissertation as part of your training to be a future researcher (in academia or elsewhere). Applicants should consider carefully the formulation of a potential MPhil dissertation topic before applying to the programme. However, the proposed topic is not considered binding. Students work with their supervisors to fine-tune their focus or even find a different, more suitable topic.For a list of some of the past MPhil dissertation topics click here. Please note that these topics reflect not only the personal intellectual interests of the students but also the shifts over time of the research expertise of the staff members. Current graduate students and their projects.Besides the above-mentioned coursework you will have plenty of other opportunities within and beyond the Department of East Asian Studies or the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies to hone your research and other professional skills.

It is designed for highly-motivated future researchers who have a substantial undergraduate background in Chinese Studies or related fields but need more exposure to topic-specific or discipline-based analytical frameworks and more intense training in primary source language(s) and research skills. All prospective MPhil applicants are advised to peruse the staff profiles on our website to familiarise themselves with the research and teaching interests of staff members. Applicants should contact potential supervisors by email and discuss potential MPhil dissertation topics. Each member of our staff has much wider academic interests, so you should explore potential topics of interest freely. Do not feel obliged to find a topic that caters to the specific interest of potential supervisors.Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation (sometimes a staff member will be on sabbatical or research leave and cannot take on any new research student during that year). Applicants with a substantial training in the relevant skills and with a very specific research interest are advised to consult with individual staff members to explore the possibility of doing a MPhil in Chinese Studies ‘by dissertation only’. Those who do 'dissertation only' will write a longer dissertation (up to 25,000 words) and the assessment includes an oral examination of the dissertation (viva).All applications for graduate study at the University are made online via the Graduate Admissions Office (GAO).

These include dissertations resulting from the former two-year MPhil programme. A large number of these students continued their research training in doctoral programmes at Cambridge or elsewhere. Many have become academics who teach all over the world, while others have pursued their interests in other equally exciting careers.Prospective applicants interested in pre-modern history should contact Professor Roel Sterckx or Dr Imre Galambos.Prospective applicants interested in modern history should contact Professor Hans van de Ven.Late Qing Policies towards the Diasporic Chinese in British Malaya (supervised by Dr Adam Chau)Prospective applicants interested in literature should contact Dr Heather Inwood.Prospective applicants interested in film, theatre and dance should contact Dr Heather Inwood.Ligne Claire: The Cross-Cultural Transmission and Transformation of Chinese Painting TechniquesProspective applicants interested in anthropology and sociology should contact Dr Adam Yuet Chau.Prospective applicants interested in linguistics should contact Dr Boping Yuan. Please note that the current Chinese Studies MPhil curriculum does not provide any concentrated training in linguistics.Although the Chinese Studies teaching staff in this department does not include economists or political scientists,  Dr Adam Yuet Chau is interested in supervising topics relating to Chinese political and economic life as it relates to broader social transformations. (This excludes topics involving technical research such as econometric or statistical analysis). [The past MPhil dissertations relating to economics reflect the fact that our department used to have an economist on the staff.] Two political scientists at the University of Cambridge are connected to our programme, Dr Kun-Chin Lin of POLIS and Dr Robert Weatherley, an affiliated lecturer in Chinese politics. Please note that even though Drs. Lin and Weatherley are available for consultation about MPhil research projects in their areas of expertise they will not be able to serve as official MPhil supervisors in FAMES.© 2017 University of Cambridge

While it was somewhat difficult adapting to a very different educational system, for the most part, I’m actually a bit surprised by how comfortable I’ve felt here. The university’s college system does an excellent job of helping both British and international graduate students to naturally establish a kind of “home base,” something which can be a bit more difficult than it would be for undergraduate students. I’ve found that my college has quickly become the centre of my social network at Cambridge. It’s been great to have the opportunity to become close with people who aren’t on my course and who are engaged in and passionate about a wide range of disciplines. As I’ve progressed in my degree, I think this has actually allowed me to bring more depth to my own academic work, broadening my objects of enquiry and modes of thinking. I have found the MPhil in Chinese Studies to be quite a challenging course, best suited for students who are self-motivated and interested in cultivating their research and analytical skills as well as improving their Chinese language abilities. I hadn’t had much exposure to anthropological theory and research methodologies during my undergraduate degree so I was quite worried about any gaps in knowledge. After finishing two terms of lectures and seminars (learning from my peers as well as my professors), however, I’ve begun to feel comfortable using a range of anthropological theories and approaches in my own written work on a variety of research topics. I’ve also been conducting interviews and doing some short-term fieldwork for the purpose of presenting a more complete ethnographic understanding of China’s young, upwardly-mobile urbanites’ daily life, habits, customs, rituals and practices.Last year I completed my MPhil in Chinese Studies and this year I began my PhD in the anthropology of Chinese religion, both in the Department of East Asian Studies.  Having studied Chinese and History at SOAS for my undergraduate degree, I was looking for a course which would be challenging and allow me to develop my research skills.  I found the MPhil Programme in Chinese Studies to be flexible and suited to those who want to use their language skills to focus on a specific area of interest, particularly in preparation for a PhD. During my MPhil, I took courses in ‘Anthropology of China’ and ‘Asia in Theory’, which provided me with a theoretical basis for my research and allowed for group discussions of key themes and concepts.  As my focus is on Chinese religion, specifically Daoism, my department arranged for me to take a special module in ‘Ritual and Religion’ to support my dissertation project.  In addition to classes with other MPhil students, I had one-on-one teaching for two hours a week with my dissertation supervisor, who is a specialist in the anthropology of Chinese religion, and this really pushed me to develop my ideas and deepen my understanding of the subject.  My supervisor also helped me to arrange language exchange with native Chinese speakers on postgraduate programmes in the department.  This has fostered a real sense of community and camaraderie in learning which I believe is vital to progress in any degree that requires intensive use of a field language. The PhD can seem a daunting prospect but with support and input from my supervisor and contemporaries, I am enjoying the process of preparing for my first year report and planning my fieldwork.  Postgraduate students have the opportunity to participate in regular seminars in order to practice presenting research and conducting question and answer sessions.  These are invaluable as they give us the chance to try out new ideas in a non-judgemental academic environment, and to discuss and defend our work amongst peers before presenting at external conferences. The department also arranges research seminars throughout the academic year, inviting an impressive range of speakers to present on a broad variety of topics. In this way we can get to know academics in our field, build networks, and discuss our research in both formal and informal settings. I have also had the opportunity to attend several external conferences and workshops, including the ‘Shifu Conference’ in Paris which focused on Chinese religion and included an array of researchers who presented on their topics and were keen to discuss with and encourage the postgraduate students.  Between the MPhil and the start of the PhD I attended a week long text-reading summer training programme which featured a range of Chinese language materials from Dunhuang manuscripts to Republican period reports.  Engaging with these different sources was exceptionally helpful practice for considering material for my own thesis.The collegiate system at Cambridge also offers many opportunities to broaden one’s interests and skills, providing a necessary counter-balance to the intense rigour of academic life.  Colleges arrange lots of events for postgraduates both socially and academically, with many hosting their own postgraduate conferences and speaker events, as well as providing pastoral support for students.  I sing with a chapel choir a couple of times a week during term-time which not only allows me to develop my musical skills and expand my knowledge of Western sacred music, but also to get to know people outside my subject area and practice discussing and explaining my research to non-specialists. This unique collegiate system creates a rich and diverse academic environment which supports us in our research and gives us opportunities to develop a wide range of supplementary skills. The MPhil programme in Chinese Studies was a rewarding and demanding year of study, and a year that I thoroughly enjoyed.The students in my MPhil cohort had all spent quite a bit of time in China, and being able to put language skills and experience of living in China to use in furthering our research interests was really intellectually stimulating. I had done a lot of Chinese language in my undergraduate degree, and really valued the opportunity to think more theoretically and structurally about the study of Chinese society.The course had a good balance between taught components and individual research, and the year is spaced out well with teaching in the first two terms, assessment essays due after Easter, and time to focus on your dissertation research after the beginning of Easter term. Apart from the papers you take, there is also the option to audit other classes. Staff in the department have a range of expertise and experience, and are both knowledgeable and demanding, pushing you to achieve your best: they won’t hold your hand and tell you exactly what to do, but they will encourage you to ask good questions, think analytically, and to apply yourself in your studies. There were certainly a few challenges – getting through substantial amounts of reading, engaging with theoretical frameworks and primary sources in Chinese, and narrowing down my research topic to make it something that could be dealt with in a 15,000-word dissertation – but with a strong sense of excitement and enjoyment during the whole course.Cambridge is an excellent place to be a student. There is a wealth of libraries, archives and electronic resources, and there are plenty of activities (academic and otherwise) going on – the difficulty is just fitting it all in! The collegiate structure is also a great advantage for graduate students. Although teaching happens in the Faculty rather than the College, your College still provides great opportunities to get involved and have a sense of community.If you have a strong interest in China, a good grounding in understanding Chinese society, and want to develop your research skills for a career either inside or outside academia, doing an MPhil in Chinese Studies at Cambridge will be an enduringly rewarding and memorable year.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Cambridge offers world-class library resources as well as academic staff who are world-recognised in the study of both modern and pre-modern China.  Our graduate students meet regularly with their supervisor/advisor and attend lectures and seminars in the Faculty and across the University. There is a weekly China Research Seminar with guest speakers from all over the world, as well as several established distinguished lecture series. These are excellent opportunities for you to meet many well-known scholars and interact with them in seminars as well as in many informal settings.Doctoral students working on topics relating to the history of science and technology in China also have the unique opportunity to work with the collections held at the Needham Research Institute (李約瑟研究所) (NRI). Students working on pre-modern topics can attend weekly seminars at the NRI, where a constant stream of visiting scholars with exciting projects share their ideas and the pleasure of using pre-modern, textual primary sources in their various fields of research. You can also participate in the popular student-run graduate research presentations in the department. The University of Cambridge has a large number of researchers and scholars who specialise in China or have research interests in China who work in other faculties and departments (e.g. the Needham Research Institute; the Fitzwilliam Museum; the Judge Business School; History; Social Anthropology; Politics; History and Philosophy of Science; Architecture; Land Economy; Development Studies; Theoretical and Applied Linguistic; etc.). And every year we host quite a few visiting scholars and PhD students from many parts of the world. These are all valuable resources for you to draw upon.During your time at Cambridge you are also likely to be involved in one or several conferences or workshops. The collegiate environment stimulates exposure to ideas and work by colleagues and fellow graduates in other disciplines. Whenever opportunities arise, we also do our best to engage our advanced doctoral candidates in undergraduate teaching and college supervisions to enable them to gain teaching experience. Our graduate community in Chinese studies is very international and friendly, and nearly all our doctoral graduates have secured postdoctoral and/or continuing academic employment.Cambridge has a vibrant and welcoming Chinese Studies community and we would like to invite you to join us and the world-wide community of Chinese Studies scholars.And of course if you study with us you will be living and working alongside other intellectually-serious young people in one of the most famous and beautiful university towns in the world.The proposed topic of research is the central element in any application, and an application is strengthened if a topic is clearly described. The application is done via the Cambridge online application platform. Amongst other application materials such as past academic transcripts, you will be asked to submit up to two pieces of writing samples. One can be a piece of significant writing from your past degree programmes (e.g. an essay or chapter from your undergraduate/master's dissertation), while the other can be a detailed PhD project proposal that includes sections on the research question, review of secondary literature, research design (how you plan to gather relevant data and how you will analyse your data) and significance of the proposed research (i.e. in what ways your research will contribute to scholarship). The Teaching Officers in Chinese welcome inquiries. Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation (sometimes a staff member will be on sabbatical or research leave and cannot take on any new research student during that year). Please note that under normal circumstances an applicant to our PhD programme must be currently engaged in a master's-level (or MPhil) academic programme or has already obtained a master's-level (or MPhil) degree.We recognise that doing a PhD is a considerable investment in time, energy and money. While occasionally individual students manage to finish in three years, the more typical scenario is four years. Because all PhD students are required to pay three years of full fees, the financial cost of doing a PhD is considerable (even more so for non-EU students). However, if you have performed exceptionally well in your undergraduate and master's degrees (i.e. high GPA) you should have a decent chance of getting a scholarship to cover most of the cost over the three to four years of PhD studies. Many of our past and current PhD students have been funded by scholarships. We encourage you to explore widely various funding opportunities, including those that are based in specific countries and are for nationals of those countries (e.g. Gates US for US nationals, China Scholarship Council for Chinese nationals, Cambridge-Taiwan for Taiwanese nationals, etc.). Some colleges at the University of Cambridge also offer graduate scholarships, though they require that you put them down as first-choice college when you apply.For applicants who are not native speakers of English their chance of being considered for a PhD place and a PhD scholarship would be enhanced if they have already met the English-proficiency requirement for postgraduate studies (currently IELTS 7.5 average and above 7 in all sections) when they submit their applications. So please plan well ahead and make sure that you will get the IELTS results before the particular application deadline by which you plan to apply.Here are some information on funding opportunities that are specific to the Faculty and are University-wide.Noteworthy:The Louis Cha Scholarship for Pre-Modern Chinese StudiesThe Tunku Abdul Rahman Fund (for Malaysian nationals studying in Cambridge, especially in humanities and social-science fields relating to Southeast Asia and East Asia)PhD scholarship offered by the Universities' China Committee in London (UCCL) The PhD degree involves writing a thesis which should not exceed 80,000 words exclusive of footnotes and bibliography. The overall word limit is 100,000 words, exclusive of bibliography. PhD students must meet a residence requirement of not less than six terms at Cambridge.A graduate student is allocated a Supervisor, with whom he or she meets regularly to discuss his or her research programme in detail. The first year of research is regarded as probationary, and at the end of it candidates take a PhD Progress Examination. This usually consists of two submissions, the first an account of the topic of research in the context of secondary scholarship relating to it, and the second an exercise in the sort of research that will ultimately form part of the PhD thesis itself. If the first year's submission is assessed as satisfactory, the Degree Committee will recommend registration for the PhD Degree.The second and third years are spent in research and writing. Graduate students also participate in the seminars and reading classes organised in the Faculty. If there are opportunities to do so, they may also help in teaching undergraduates, through the supervision system (paid on an hourly basis).  The Graduate Handbook contains detailed information on the PhD programme. Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Some recent Cambridge PhD theses have formed the bases for important books.

There is a weekly China Research Seminar with guest speakers from all over the world, as well as several established distinguished lecture series. These are excellent opportunities for you to meet many well-known scholars and interact with them in seminars as well as in many informal settings.Doctoral students working on topics relating to the history of science and technology in China also have the unique opportunity to work with the collections held at the Needham Research Institute (李約瑟研究所) (NRI). Students working on pre-modern topics can attend weekly seminars at the NRI, where a constant stream of visiting scholars with exciting projects share their ideas and the pleasure of using pre-modern, textual primary sources in their various fields of research. You can also participate in the popular student-run graduate research presentations in the department. The University of Cambridge has a large number of researchers and scholars who specialise in China or have research interests in China who work in other faculties and departments (e.g. the Needham Research Institute; the Fitzwilliam Museum; the Judge Business School; History; Social Anthropology; Politics; History and Philosophy of Science; Architecture; Land Economy; Development Studies; Theoretical and Applied Linguistic; etc.). And every year we host quite a few visiting scholars and PhD students from many parts of the world. These are all valuable resources for you to draw upon.During your time at Cambridge you are also likely to be involved in one or several conferences or workshops. The collegiate environment stimulates exposure to ideas and work by colleagues and fellow graduates in other disciplines. Whenever opportunities arise, we also do our best to engage our advanced doctoral candidates in undergraduate teaching and college supervisions to enable them to gain teaching experience. Our graduate community in Chinese studies is very international and friendly, and nearly all our doctoral graduates have secured postdoctoral and/or continuing academic employment.Cambridge has a vibrant and welcoming Chinese Studies community and we would like to invite you to join us and the world-wide community of Chinese Studies scholars.And of course if you study with us you will be living and working alongside other intellectually-serious young people in one of the most famous and beautiful university towns in the world.The proposed topic of research is the central element in any application, and an application is strengthened if a topic is clearly described. The application is done via the Cambridge online application platform. Amongst other application materials such as past academic transcripts, you will be asked to submit up to two pieces of writing samples. One can be a piece of significant writing from your past degree programmes (e.g. an essay or chapter from your undergraduate/master's dissertation), while the other can be a detailed PhD project proposal that includes sections on the research question, review of secondary literature, research design (how you plan to gather relevant data and how you will analyse your data) and significance of the proposed research (i.e. in what ways your research will contribute to scholarship). The Teaching Officers in Chinese welcome inquiries. Before applying to our programmes, please email your prospective supervisor for initial consultation (sometimes a staff member will be on sabbatical or research leave and cannot take on any new research student during that year). Please note that under normal circumstances an applicant to our PhD programme must be currently engaged in a master's-level (or MPhil) academic programme or has already obtained a master's-level (or MPhil) degree.We recognise that doing a PhD is a considerable investment in time, energy and money. While occasionally individual students manage to finish in three years, the more typical scenario is four years. Because all PhD students are required to pay three years of full fees, the financial cost of doing a PhD is considerable (even more so for non-EU students). However, if you have performed exceptionally well in your undergraduate and master's degrees (i.e. high GPA) you should have a decent chance of getting a scholarship to cover most of the cost over the three to four years of PhD studies. Many of our past and current PhD students have been funded by scholarships. We encourage you to explore widely various funding opportunities, including those that are based in specific countries and are for nationals of those countries (e.g. Gates US for US nationals, China Scholarship Council for Chinese nationals, Cambridge-Taiwan for Taiwanese nationals, etc.). Some colleges at the University of Cambridge also offer graduate scholarships, though they require that you put them down as first-choice college when you apply.For applicants who are not native speakers of English their chance of being considered for a PhD place and a PhD scholarship would be enhanced if they have already met the English-proficiency requirement for postgraduate studies (currently IELTS 7.5 average and above 7 in all sections) when they submit their applications. So please plan well ahead and make sure that you will get the IELTS results before the particular application deadline by which you plan to apply.Here are some information on funding opportunities that are specific to the Faculty and are University-wide.Noteworthy:The Louis Cha Scholarship for Pre-Modern Chinese StudiesThe Tunku Abdul Rahman Fund (for Malaysian nationals studying in Cambridge, especially in humanities and social-science fields relating to Southeast Asia and East Asia)PhD scholarship offered by the Universities' China Committee in London (UCCL) The PhD degree involves writing a thesis which should not exceed 80,000 words exclusive of footnotes and bibliography. The overall word limit is 100,000 words, exclusive of bibliography. PhD students must meet a residence requirement of not less than six terms at Cambridge.A graduate student is allocated a Supervisor, with whom he or she meets regularly to discuss his or her research programme in detail. The first year of research is regarded as probationary, and at the end of it candidates take a PhD Progress Examination. This usually consists of two submissions, the first an account of the topic of research in the context of secondary scholarship relating to it, and the second an exercise in the sort of research that will ultimately form part of the PhD thesis itself. If the first year's submission is assessed as satisfactory, the Degree Committee will recommend registration for the PhD Degree.The second and third years are spent in research and writing. Graduate students also participate in the seminars and reading classes organised in the Faculty. If there are opportunities to do so, they may also help in teaching undergraduates, through the supervision system (paid on an hourly basis).  The Graduate Handbook contains detailed information on the PhD programme. Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Some recent Cambridge PhD theses have formed the bases for important books.

The department also arranges research seminars throughout the academic year, inviting an impressive range of speakers to present on a broad variety of topics. In this way we can get to know academics in our field, build networks, and discuss our research in both formal and informal settings. I have also had the opportunity to attend several external conferences and workshops, including the ‘Shifu Conference’ in Paris which focused on Chinese religion and included an array of researchers who presented on their topics and were keen to discuss with and encourage the postgraduate students.  Between the MPhil and the start of the PhD I attended a week long text-reading summer training programme which featured a range of Chinese language materials from Dunhuang manuscripts to Republican period reports.  Engaging with these different sources was exceptionally helpful practice for considering material for my own thesis.The collegiate system at Cambridge also offers many opportunities to broaden one’s interests and skills, providing a necessary counter-balance to the intense rigour of academic life.  Colleges arrange lots of events for postgraduates both socially and academically, with many hosting their own postgraduate conferences and speaker events, as well as providing pastoral support for students.  I sing with a chapel choir a couple of times a week during term-time which not only allows me to develop my musical skills and expand my knowledge of Western sacred music, but also to get to know people outside my subject area and practice discussing and explaining my research to non-specialists. This unique collegiate system creates a rich and diverse academic environment which supports us in our research and gives us opportunities to develop a wide range of supplementary skills. Deciding to return to graduate school mid-career to get my PhD was not easy because it required a great commitment of time and money, as well as long bouts away from home and family. There are so many things to consider when choosing a graduate programme: the reputation of the school, faculty, department and supervisor. Then, of course, there are the considerations of funding, training opportunities, library resources and everyday things like accommodation, meals and the local community. Finding the right place is difficult, but fortunately I have found that here in Chinese Studies at Cambridge.As a first-year graduate student in our department, the fast pace and intense coursework are challenging. Being a student of modern Chinese history, I participated in three weekly seminars on Asia in Theory, Chinese Historical Documents and War in the Making of Modern China. I capped each week by attending the China Research Seminar, where scholars from around the world come to give talks on a variety of China-related topics and then have dinner with our graduate students. I met my supervisor regularly throughout the year to discuss my own research and went to talks held by the History Faculty to learn more about the field. Most importantly, I found that our department has a very positive vibe, which buoys your spirits when you are trying to grasp new concepts or when reading and translating difficult texts. Apart from my supervisor being very supportive of my research, the other faculty members in our department are also very giving of their time, and there is good camaraderie amongst the graduate students in our Faculty. Another aspect that is nice about Cambridge is the collegiate system. Your college is more than just a dormitory—it's a small community outside of your daily work in the faculty. Most of my neighbours in college are from other disciplines, but we are all going through a PhD programme. We commune together in the buttery, gym, food hall, staircase kitchen and middle common room, or at formal dinners, club meetings or academic society events. I myself like to get my hands dirty weeding, digging, planting and picking vegetables during our gardening club work sessions. We also like to take weekend excursions to Cambridge’s city centre, which is a lovely place, or to its surrounding villages by bicycle, which is the best way to get around town. All in all, I think of my college as a home away from home.As a PhD candidate (second year onward), the pace is just as fast and the research work is equally as intense as the first year. This academic year, I am working on my dissertation topic, which is about the history of Nationalist radio in Republican China, and spend much of my time going through radio-related primary sources such as memoirs, literature, official documents, radio plays, children’s shows, operas, lectures, news, programming schedules, musical recordings, song lyrics and photographs. In addition to doing research in one of the many libraries on campus, I am receiving training as a teaching assistant in a first-year undergraduate East Asian history paper (i.e., a course) and as a supervisor to second-year undergraduates taking a paper on China and globalisation. I also am taking personal and professional development courses offered by the university as well as a Japanese course to further improve my research skills.If you were to ask me whether I would recommend the graduate programme in Chinese Studies at Cambridge, you probably already know my answer by now: it would be an unequivocal yes. I would also recommend stocking up on strong coffee and tea.I started my PhD in modern Chinese history (supported by an Arts and Humanities Research Council doctoral scholarship) at the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (FAMES) in 2012 after having read Chinese as an undergraduate here before. Making the transition from being an undergraduate to becoming a PhD student was somewhat daunting at first. While I enjoyed the new freedom to follow my interests and delve into my research on foreign banking in late 19th and early 20th century China, in the beginning I was at times not sure how to actually do a PhD. Fortunately, both the guidance of my supervisor and advisor and the courses at the University’s Researcher Development Programme quickly helped me develop a clear research plan and structure my studies in terms of what classes to attend and audit, what seminars to attend and how to prepare my first-year progress reports. The DEAS Postgraduate Seminar gave me the opportunity to start presenting my work in a friendly environment and to meet other graduate students in the faculty. Starting from the first year of my PhD, funding from the Faculty and my College also enabled me to spend several Easter and summer breaks collecting archival materials in British and German archives.During my first year, I also discussed my plans for archival work in China with my supervisor. Not only did he suggest possible sources of funding but through a partnership he had established with East China Normal University (ECNU) in Shanghai I was able to find a Chinese advisor and an affiliation with a Chinese university for the period of my archival work, which made everything much more convenient and easy to organise. Subsequently, research funding from both the German Academic Exchange Service and the partnership programme with ECNU allowed me to spend sixteen months conducting archival work in China. Spending such an extended period of time in China allowed me to visit numerous archives in China from Tianjin and Beijing in North China to Nanjing and Guangzhou in the South and unearth many hitherto unused primary sources crucial for my research. Throughout the period I spent in China, I kept in touch with my supervisor and also benefitted from the guidance of my Chinese advisor and the history faculty at ECNU. Contacts of the Faculty to the Academia Sinica in Taiwan also allowed me to spend a month collecting sources in archives in Taiwan.After my return to Cambridge, I began writing up my thesis. In the writing-up process, I again benefitted from the guidance of my supervisor and other members of faculty in East Asian Studies. Participating in the weekly China Research Seminar at FAMES, which brings many prominent scholars in Chinese Studies to the Faculty, as well as in the numerous seminars at the Faculty of History provided the ideal intellectual environment for the writing-up process. Moreover, financial support from both the Faculty and my College allowed me to present my work at national and international conferences, where I could receive useful feedback and meet with other researchers in my field. I was able to organise a panel for the annual Association for Asian Studies conference, the biggest and most important conference for Asianists. As my doctoral career is drawing to a close, both my supervisor and other faculty members at FAMES and the University’s Careers Service have provided invaluable help in preparing my job applications. In sum, FAMES has provided me with an ideal environment that proved to be both intellectually stimulating and extremely supportive throughout my PhD career.© 2017 University of Cambridge

The Faculty Library and Common Room are natural centres of activity for undergraduates and postgraduates reading Chinese Studies and other AMES subjects. The library site provides some links to useful Chinese Studies resources.Students may also use the University Library's sizeable holdings of Chinese books. The Library's Chinese collection, founded on Sir Thomas Wade's donation of his books in 1888, is recognised as one of the finest in Europe. The Library has entensive holdings in history, local and national; biography; geography; archaeology and epigraphy; law and literature. It is especially strong in holdings relating to early and premodern Chinese history; but twentieth century materials are also being built up. The Library is open-shelf, and easy access to its stacks is one of the great advantages it offers to research students.The Chinese collections comprise about 120,000 printed volumes (including bound serials) which contain over 150,000 monograph titles and over 250,000 individual titles of other (reprinted) materials such as manuscripts from Dunhuang, Huizhou, etc., archival documents and epigraphical rubbings. Over 300,000 titles are included in some 2,000 cong shu. The Chinese collection is complemented by large Japanese holdings.Cambridge is within easy reach of London and the British Library and the School of Oriental and African Studies Library.© 2017 University of Cambridge

This involvement can range from having studied the tripos to research and teaching in China-related areas.The aims of the Society are twofold. Firstly, to promote contact between Cambridge Chinese studies alumni through a combination of events (in the UK and China). Secondly, to encourage contact between alumni and current Chinese studies students, staff and researchers at Cambridge. Sir Thomas Francis Wade, GCMG, KCB (25 August 1818 to 31 July 1895) was a British diplomat and sinologist. He was the first Professor of Chinese at Cambridge and produced a syllabary in 1859 that was later amended, extended and converted into the Wade-Giles Romanisation for Mandarin Chinese by Herbert Giles in 1892.The year of the Thomas Wade Society's foundation, 2009, coincides with the University's 800th anniversary year and the 150th anniversary of Sir Thomas Wade's romanisation system for Mandarin Chinese.After a brief hiatus following the departure of the outgoing committee, The Wade Society is being rebooted for 2017. Following a short consultation with alumni, we will build a society both faithful to the founding aims and suited to its membership. The de facto General Secretary is currently Gregor McMillan (2016), who will hand over to a formal committee later in 2016. We will hold a launch event in London in Late Summer-Early Autumn 2017, and annual events thereafter.If you would like to get involved with the society, please contact Gregor, the General Secretary at gregorjmcmillan@gmail.com © 2017 University of Cambridge

In most cases, it also aims to develop students' linguistic skills as well as methodological sophistication.There are two kinds of MPhil in Japanese Studies:The Advanced Studies MPhil in Japanese Studies is a specially designed one-year research course with substantial taught elements for students who want to deepen their undergraduate education and/or prepare for a PhD in Japanese Studies. The aim is to equip students to carry out independent academic work, including training in how to use primary sources for research purposes, which lies at the heart of the programme. Our guiding principle is to ensure that each student receives the best possible education, providing a coherent course but with the flexibility to cater for individual needs.The Research MPhil in Japanese Studies allows students who already have strong research skills to focus mainly on a thesis but there is also one required researcher development seminar. For the thesis the Degree Committee, after considering the candidate's experience, qualifications and proposed subject, grants permission for the student to offer a thesis. The thesis should be on a subject approved by the Degree Committee, and has a word limit 25,000, including footnotes and appendices but excluding bibliography. In this option, an oral examination on the thesis and on the general field in which it falls will be required.Where possible, we would encourage you to discuss your particular interests with potential supervisors before applying.

        The Raven web authentication system is provided and managed by University Information Services.© 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of Asian and Middle Eastern StudiesStudying at CambridgeThe official regulations for this course can be found here (The Japanese Studies pathway was approved in November 2015 and is thus not mentioned here): http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2013-14/weekly/6355/section4.shtml#heading2-27  In their dissertation, students will be required to demonstrate research competence using Japanese-language sources, and to conduct research that addresses contemporary and/or historical issues of relevance to Japan. Prospective students are asked to contact potential supervisors before applying to Cambridge to ensure that an appropriate supervisor is available.One-on-one supervisions will be held by the main supervisors and will take place typically at the beginning of the academic year and in the Easter term. In addition, the Researcher Development Seminar (see under 2.1) will help to guide students through the research process.Form and conduct: a dissertation of max. 15,000 words (incl. footnotes but excl. bibliography)Submission date: mid-August.  Each of the three papers (a paper is an exam for which teaching is provided) is assessed either by a research essay of maximum 5,000 words or an alternative exercise agreed by the Degree Committee and counts for one sixth of the total grade (i.e. 16.67 percent).Please note that modules offered vary according to the staff available each academic year and the interest of students, and that papers are usually only offered if there are at least two takers.Submission date of essays and alternative exercises is at the start of Easter term (check the Graduate Handbook for submission date).  This is held by all the supervisors of the MPhil pathway and external teachers, and is convened by Prof Mickey Adolphson.The Researcher Development Seminar meets throughout the first two terms, providing important skills for a successful dissertation. Students will receive training on sources and resources, library searches, academic writing, analysis and presentation skills, writing a research proposal or grant application, career planning etc., and will have opportunities to engage in peer review as they present their dissertation proposals.Form and conduct: Alternative exercise; regular participation is required.      Historical Narratives of Ancient and Medieval Japan (Mickey Adolphson)This paper offers graduate students an opportunity to critique and analyze Japanese narratives of the pre-1600 era and to work directly with primary sources. Students will initially be introduced to sources, methods, approaches and tools used by scholars in the field of pre-modern Japanese history and will subsequently read and interpret a variety of premodern Japanese sources, working towards an independent translation and analysis.Form and conduct: essay of max. 5,000 words that analyzes and contextualizes a set of sources chosen by the student. New Approaches in Early-modern Japanese Literature (Laura Moretti)This paper explores Japanese early-modern literature by taking graduate students beyond the limited canon normally discussed in literary histories to date. Students will be trained in how to access, decode, describe and analyse a wide range of primary sources in their original format. This will allow reflections on publishing genres, themes and issues in the field of early-modern Japanese literature that remain under-researched to date. The paper is taught in seminar format over two terms. The assessment takes the form of an essay where the student analyses and contextualizes a set of sources chosen by the student.Form and conduct: essay of maximum 5000 words.  [EA.1] Asia in Theory (Adam Chau, Hans van de Ven)This paper consists of weekly seminars in Michaelmas and Lent terms, each of which focuses on a particular type of theory and its relevance to the study of East Asia. Topics covered include Michel Foucault, the nation, gender, modernity and recent developments in historiography.Form and conduct: research essay of maximum 5,000 words.  [EA.4]: Topics in modern Korean history: Japanese imperialism in Korea (Michael Shin) *Not available in 2017-18*Teaching provision: 16 sessions of two hours per academic yearForm and conduct: research essay of maximum 5,000 words. Additional papers may be introduced.   Classical Japanese Texts (Laura Moretti)This is a language-based paper for which you will read a variety of pre-modern and early-modern texts, thereby providing an opportunity to explore a range of topics related, more or less directly, to pre-Meiji Japan (e.g. intralingual translation, parody, national identity, news, popular medicine, popular Buddhism, humour, visual culture, graphic prose, etc.). The topic (or topics), and consequently the choice of the primary sources, is decided in consultation with students as the aim is to accommodate individual research interests. If you are planning to write a dissertation that deals with the Meiji or pre-Meiji period, you will find this paper extremely useful as it will help you acquire the necessary skills for reading primary sources. It will also enable you to consolidate and extend your knowledge of modern Japanese as a result of extensive reading of secondary sources in Japanese on the topic(s). This paper requires previous knowledge of classical Japanese, obtained either by having taken J7 (see language options) or simply by having studied and mastered Haruo Shirane’s Classical Japanese (2005). Contemporary Japanese Society (Brigitte Steger)This is an advanced seminar-based course focusing on contemporary Japanese society. The focus will vary from year to year, and will cover issues such as learning and education, family, time, space and gender, investigating these topics from a wide range of angles. In each instance the emphasis will be on situating the study of Japan within the disciplinary context of Social Anthropology and Sociology. The course is aimed at deepening students’ understanding of selected aspects of Japanese society as well as developing research and writing skills. It will involve working with both secondary and primary source materials (in Japanese). [EA.2] The Cold War in East Asia and its Aftermath (John Nilsson-Wright, Barak Kushner)This seminar-based course employs a comparative approach. It concentrates on thematic and policy issues relevant to understanding Japan, the Korean peninsula, China (broadly defined) and Southeast Asia, as well as the role of the United States in East Asia. The course runs over two terms and draws explicitly on historical research and social science methodology in addressing how best to conceptualize ‘East Asia’ as a region. Topics addressed will vary from year to year, depending on the research interests of the teaching officers involved, but an indicative list of subjects would include some, but not necessarily all, of the following issues: the Cold War as a historical phenomenon; conflict and war in East Asia and contemporary security challenges; comparative models of economic development in East Asia and the role of ‘plan-rational’ policy-making; the role of the nation-state and competing models of historical identity; multilateralism, the emergence of trans-national actors and economic integration in East Asia; political legitimacy, contrasting models of authoritarian rule, and democratization as a political movement; demographic change; energy and environmental policy and technological change. [J.15]  Modern Japanese Cultural History (Dr Victoria Young)This seminar-style paper will explore specific facets, approaches and methodologies of modern and contemporary works of Japanese literature and culture. Topics may vary from year to year, but will generally cover a range of works that have been produced within contexts deemed ‘other’ or marginal vis-à-vis the mainstream, and will pay particular attention to issues of social, gendered, and ethnic difference that these works present. Informed by feminist, postcolonial, and translational approaches, this course aims to broaden your awareness of the kinds of texts produced in Japanese. Moreover, by drawing on key concepts and works of literary criticism, this course aims to hone your critical reading skills and enable you to engage with key questions pertaining to identity and difference in the study of a non-western literature. Supervision for all papers in group B: one short one-on-one discussion about the mini dissertation in Michaelmas term, and a one-on-one supervision in Lent term. Form and conduct: research essay of maximum 5,000 words.   J.12 Modern Japanese Texts 3 (various teachers)This paper consists of reading texts in advanced modern Japanese with attention given not only to grammar and syntax but also to context. Supplementary reading will also be expected. J.7 Literary Japanese (Laura Moretti)An introduction to the grammar of literary pre-modern Japanese, followed by readings of simple prose and poetry. Intermediate Japanese ability is required.This is an introduction to the world of pre-modern and early-modern written Japanese. We will read a variety of primary sources, beginning with the Edo period (graphic prose, humorous prose, didactic prose) and working backwards through the Muromachi period (otogizōshi), the Kamakura period (Tsurezuregusa and Hōjōki) to the Heian period (Ise monogatari and/or Genji monogatari and waka poetry). You will gain an in-depth knowledge of Japanese classical grammar that will enable you to read texts produced up to the 1910s, while developing an understanding of pre-Meiji culture and literature (both learned and popular). You will also receive instruction on translating literary texts into English and have a chance to practice translation from classical Japanese into contemporary Japanese, thus helping to improve your modern Japanese language skills.

Students will mainly be reading materials in hangul script, but some texts in mixed script (with Chinese characters) will also be used.All the papers in group C are also offered to undergraduate students. Please contact the teacher of the paper to make sure that the level is appropriate for you. No supervisions (one-on-one classes) are given, as classes provide all the necessary support. Form and conduct: alternative exercise.  Papers in the discipline related to the research topic of the dissertation. These papers will be mainly borrowed from other faculties, e.g. Anthropology, Literature Studies, History, Politics, Gender Studies. Form and conduct: Research essay or alternative exercise.Please note that borrowing papers from other faculties needs to be negotiated and approved by the Degree Committee. If you are interested in taking a paper offered by another faculty, please contact your prospective supervisor as soon as you have been offered a place.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Over the decades since Japanese Studies started at Cambridge in 1947 there has been a growing number of PhD students and many have gone on to publish their dissertations and to secure academic posts.Current students are researching topics that range from seasonal labour migration in Japan to the Shingon temple complex Kyasan in the medieval period, from political satire in 18th-century Japan to proletarian women's writing from the period of the Japanese occupation of Korea, and from Japanese foreign policy in Central Asia to the history of medicine in Japan.As a minimum requirement, if you are hoping to do PhD work at Cambridge you will need to satisfy the Faculty that you have a strong foundation in the Japanese language and a clear idea of the research you propose to undertake. The doctorate is not a taught course. The topic should be in a subject area which a member of staff can realistically supervise, but all enquiries are welcome and students are advised to write to a potential supervisor in the first instance to discuss their research proposal. Formal application is made to the Board of Graduate Studies, and the Faculty’s Degree Committee makes recommendations. Students who are accepted are assigned to one of the Cambridge colleges, which can usually provide some accommodation. Colleges also offer a place to socialize, and exchange ideas with graduate students in other disciplines.The PhD degree involves writing a thesis which should not exceed 80,000 words exclusive of footnotes and bibliography. The overall word limit is 100,000 words, exclusive of bibliography. PhD students must meet a residence requirement of no fewer than three terms at Cambridge and are expected to meet the cost of nine terms of study irrespective of where they reside. As a graduate student you are allocated a supervisor, who will meet regularly with you and monitor your progress. At the end of your first year of research you are required to submit a PhD Progress Examination. This usually consists of two long essays, one of a bibliographical nature and the other a substantial piece of work based on the first year's research. Once you have passed the PhD Progress Examination you are formally registered for the PhD degree.The second and third years are spent in research and writing. It is expected that the dissertation will be completed by the end of your third year. It should be emphasized that there is no course work at any stage: you are expected to devote your time to research in your chosen field. It is for this reason that the period of time spent acquiring a PhD at Cambridge is comparatively short. In addition to your supervisor, the various members of staff are available for conversation, exchanging ideas, and advice.© 2017 University of Cambridge

The University Library began acquiring Japanese books in 1911 and it is now one of the best research libraries for Japanese studies in Europe; as a copyright library it of course offers magnificent research facilities in almost all other fields as well.The modern Japanese collection of some 90,000 volumes is well chosen and is still expanding. Its strengths at present lie in the areas of history, religion and literature, but over the last few years strenuous efforts have been made to provide the necessary resources for modern studies in such areas as economics, modern history, society and politics. The Library subscribes to more than 300 Japanese periodicals in all areas and also to the major relevant Western-language journals.Under the Japanese Librarian, Mr Koyama, a project is now underway to provide an online computerised data-base of modern Japanese books throughout Britain, and this already provides access to the other major Japanese collections in the country.Owing to the generosity of Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance, the Library was given in 1991 a complete set of microfilms covering all 160,000 works published in the Meiji Period held in the National Diet Library in Tokyo together with state-of-the-art reader- printers. At present, this is the only set in Europe and it means that Cambridge is an ideal place at which to conduct research on all aspects of the Meiji Period.In addition, the Library contains the famous Aston Collection of some 2000 works dating from the Edo Period or before: the oldest printed items date from the Nara period and there are many rare or unique works. The collection is described in N. Hayashi & P. Kornicki, Early Japanese Books in Cambridge University Library (Cambridge U.P., 1991). Finally, the Library is also the base of the Union Catalogue of Early Japanese Books in Europe project, which is in the process of building up a data-base of all pre-1870 books throughout Europe.In addition to the University Library there is also the Faculty of Asian & Middle Eastern Studies Library which acts as a teaching library for undergraduates. It contains over 6,800 books on Japan in English and other European languages, dictionaries and basic reference books, and English-language journals. College libraries tend also to be equipped with Japanese language dictionaries and reference books.The Fitzwilliam Museum has a substantial collection of Japanese works of art as well as its own library collection.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Once a year, a prominent scholar on Korea will visit Cambridge to engage issues to which he devoted his life and to commemorate his connections with the university.Press Release [PDF]Korean newspaper article about the founding of the lectureshipNews of the most recent Kim Date Jung lecturesThe 2013 lecture was given by Professor Sohn Suk-Hee, one of the most widely respected journalists in South Korea. He is a graduate of Kookmin University in Seoul and did graduate work at the University of Minnesota. He began his career at MBC in 1984, serving as a reporter and then as a news anchor. He was the anchor of the show "100-Minute Debate" from 2002 to 2009 and has won numerous awards for his work. He teaches journalism at Sungshin Women's University and anchors a show on MBC FM radio - "Sohn Suk-Hee's Focus" - which is broadcast in the morning six days a week.The inaugural Kim Dae-Jung Memorial Lecture was given by Professor Moon Chung-in of the Department of Political Science at Yonsei University. He has published over 40 books and 230 articles in edited volumes and scholarly journals, with recent publications addressing arms control, Korean unification, and ending of the cold war in the peninsula. He served as Dean of Yonsei’s Graduate School of International Studies and taught at Williams College, University of Kentucky, Duke University, and UCSD. Professor Moon is currently a board member of the Korea Foundation, the Sejong Foundation, the East Asia Foundation, and the International Peace Foundation. He is also Editor-in-Chief of Global Asia.Often referred to as the “Nelson Mandela of Asia,” Kim Dae-Jung (1925–2009) was a democracy activist, dissident politician, and President of South Korea (1998-2003).Over the course of his decades-long struggle against the military dictatorship in South Korea, he survived an assassination attempt and was once sentenced to death. His leadership was crucial to the victory of the democracy movement in 1987, and he later became the first opposition politician to be elected President of South Korea in 1997.As President, Kim led the country through the Asian financial crisis and tried to break through decades of Cold War animosity by pursuing a policy of engagement with North Korea termed the Sunshine Policy. He went to Pyongyang for a historic summit between the two Koreas in 2000, and for his efforts to reunify and bring lasting peace to the peninsula, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.After his defeat in the presidential election of 1992, he spent several months as a visiting scholar at Clare Hall, Cambridge. He began his political comeback soon after his return to Korea and remained a devoted friend of the University until his passing. He received an honorary doctorate from the University in 2001.© 2017 University of Cambridge

She will describe North Korea’s alternate journey, and relate both to the role the United States and other powers have played – or tried to play – since the Korean War. What lessons can we draw – positive or negative – from the Korean experience about outsider efforts at nation-building, about the relationship between economic development, human rights, and democratization, about the role of security alliances and development assistance? And what does the future hold for the still-divided Korean Peninsula, and for a North Korean leadership determined to be accepted as a nuclear power?Kathleen Stephens was American ambassador to the Republic of Korea from 2008 to 2011. She first went to South Korea in the 1970s as a Peace Corps volunteer, teaching for two years in rural Korea. She returned in the 1980s as a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul covering South Korea’s tumultuous political scene. Before her nomination to be U.S. ambassador to Seoul, Stephens was Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 2005 to 2007, involved in the Six-Party Talks efforts with North Korea.Ambassador Stephens was the first Korean-speaker and first woman to hold the top U.S. job in Seoul. Her Korean-language blog was published in book form in 2010. She is the recipient of numerous awards in Korea, including the Hangul Goodwill Ambassador, Sejong Cultural Prize, Kwanghwa Diplomatic Order of Merit, and YWCA Woman Leader Special Prize. She was named the State Department’s Linguist of the Year in 2010.Stephens’ other diplomatic assignments over three decades included postings in India, China, and fracturing Yugoslavia. She was U.S. Consul General in Belfast, Northern Ireland from 1995 to 1998. In Washington, she was Director for European Affairs during the Clinton Administration, negotiator on post-conflict issues on the Balkans as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs (2003-2005), and acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs (2012).For further information, contact:Dr Matthew ShoresUniversity Lecturer in JapaneseFaculty of Asian & Middle Eastern StudiesE-mail: mws42@cam.ac.uk© 2017 University of Cambridge

Within this framework our research shows great variety from the disciplinary and geographic perspectives. Historians, anthropologists, linguists and literature specialists work alongside each other to generate a rich and diverse research environment looking at China, Japan, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.The Faculty library contains around 70,000 monograph volumes and around 180 current journals. It is primarily an English and European language collection for teaching, but it also contains numerous publications in the various Asian and Middle Eastern languages taught in the Faculty.The University Library is a legal deposit (copyright) library and has one of the largest open access collections in Europe. Acquisitions specialists complement the collection with selected purchases of overseas and foreign-language material including electronic resources. The UL also houses several major collections in all the ancient and modern Asian languages taught in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.College libraries are mainly teaching libraries. However, especially the libraries of the old Colleges often have impressive collections of books and manuscripts. © 2017 University of Cambridge

The Faculty are mindful of the fact that for these students, there are different teaching methods used at their Home Institutions. It is particularly important for these students to learn how to develop their ideas in a logical, cohesive and sophisticated manner and to adopt an independent style in their research and thinking.The Faculty strongly encourage these students to attend the Academic Development and Training for International Students (ADTIS) (formly known as English for Academic Purposes (EAP)) session offered at The Language Centre before they start their course:http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/lc/adtis/adtis-index.html#There is no formal teaching training requirement required for graduate students who study within the United Kingdom. The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies understands however, that this is a concern among its graduates. The Faculty encourages its students to be proactive and speak to their supervisor and discuss any possible opportunities for teaching training in their subject area.The Language Centre has put together a web resource with tools to help with Language teaching in collaboration with the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies:http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/graduates/gradtr/index.htmlCourses offered at The Language Centre include ‘Training for Supervisors: How to Improve Students Writing’.Any research students who wish to supervise undergraduate students in the Faculty, must sign up for the 'Supervising Undergraduates: An Introduction' course which is taught by Dr Matthew Lane (Researcher Development Consultant for the School or Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences).  Please search the Training Database to find the next available session.Any research students who are interested in supervising undergraduate students must approach their supervisor in the first instance to discuss what options for gaining teaching experience are available to them.The Language Centre has compiled a web resource guide for graduate students in language-based disciplines. Please refer to their website for further details:http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/graduates/gradtr/index.htmlPilot Project: Training Workshop Organised by the Faculties of Modern and Medieval Languages and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and The Language Centre Please check The Language Centre's website to see if this will be running this academic year.http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/graduates/gradtr/index.htmlTraining for Supervisors: How to Improve your Undergraduate students WritingThis pedagogy course trains graduates and Faculty members to teach academic writing skills to the undergraduates which they supervise. The training programme will have four components:1)  An initial online module which seeks to raise awareness of what is expected of its undergraduates in their supervision essays as well as what the key features of 'good writing' are. The module will also highlight what the key difficulties are which undergraduates grapple with in their writing, especially the challenges which non-native speakers face.3)  Having completed both the online module and the workshop, the participants will be allocated mentors from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and The Language Centre who will be available to discuss any matters which they may encounter in their supervisions. Depending on the nature of the enquiry, these mentoring sessions may be conducted over the telephone, via e-mail or in person.The School of Arts and Humanities offers bursaries to both its graduate students and early career researchers towards the cost of organising workshops and conferences.For further information, please contact Dr Ben Warn at the School of Arts and Humanities E-mail: ben.warn@admin.cam.ac.ukAt the completion of their degrees, the majority of graduate students start to look for employment. Your Principal Supervisor will be able to advise you on which Researcher Development Courses to take to make you more attractive to potential employers. Supervisors are happy to look through job and grant applications and give their advice on application covering letters, application forms and CVs etc. Your supervisor and advisor (PhD students only) will be able to provide you with reference letters.There are a number of extremely useful courses offered by the University via the Cambridge University’s Skills Portal and the Human Resources Division of the University of Cambridge:http://www.skills.cam.ac.ukhttp://www.ppd.admin.cam.ac.uk/Graduate students should also check other Faculty and Department websites to see if there are career guidance or relevant opportunities there.For graduate students who are particularly interested in teaching, there is a one-year Teaching Associate Programme offered by the Higher Education Academy which is accredited:https://www.cctl.cam.ac.uk/tap There are a variety of relevant transferable skills courses which are offered by the School of Arts and Humanities, other Faculties and Departments and the University's Researcher Development Programme - PPD.

The programme offers an in-depth introduction to South Asia’s seminal textual sources, significant language skills to interpret and analyse such sources, an understanding of the relevant historiographical and theoretical issues, and methodology training. Students with an interest in Pali or Prakrit literary cultures can work on them under Dr Kahrs' guidance.The programme is appropriate for students who have already had some previous training in Sanskrit (and, where appropriate, in Pali or Prakrit). The MPhil is by dissertation only. It aims to give students an opportunity to develop their analytical, research and writing skills in preparation for further academic research or as a way to complement and enrich their interest in the Indian religious and intellectual traditions. The dissertation-only format entails working closely with one supervisor throughout the year on a dissertation to be submitted in mid-August (see below).Even though there are no taught courses, MPhil students attend a weekly graduate seminar and other reading groups with PhD students and post-doctoral researchers, thus having an opportunity to interact with their peers and seniors in a supportive environment. They may also receive training in codicology, manuscriptology, and other skills. Where relevant, they are also encouraged to attend advanced undergraduate lectures and language courses. Students can also benefit from access to Hindi language literary sources under the guidance of the Faculty's Teaching Officer in Hindi. Students are required to submit a dissertation of not more than 25,000 words (including footnotes and appendices but excluding bibliography), on a subject approved by the Degree Committee of the Faculty. Dissertations must demonstrate the student's research competence and make use of primary sources in one or more of the languages of pre-modern South Asia.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Some have chosen to apply the languages and cultural understanding gained from their BA directly to their chosen field. Others have used the analytical skills acquired from the rapid acquisition of language to other careers, including banking.Here are what some of our graduates have to say."I now work in Tokyo for an international strategy and brand consultancy, where everything I've learnt in my degree - from Japanese language to history and sociology - has helped me excel at my profession."Sven Palys, Entrepreneur"The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies offered me an extraordinary education in the complexity and diversity of Chinese language, history and culture. Studying here laid the foundations for my subsequent career researching Chinese history and literature."Julia Lovell, University Senior Lecturer, Birkbeck CollegeMore detailed individual career profiles from recent graduates are included throughout the site:© 2017 University of Cambridge

This option allows you to continue your studies in one European language through the Modern & Medieval Languages Faculty (MML), as you start learning a Middle Eastern language from scratch in FAMES.One especially popular combination is Arabic and French, which allows students to examine the colonial presence of France in North Africa and other parts of the Middle East. Exploring the puzzle of languages through their distinctive grammars and linguistic histories has led other students to continue their studies of Russian or German alongside Arabic and linguistics, for example. Many students love taking on the challenge of learning languages for their own sake."Having spent nine years studying French and Spanish, I saw university as a unique chance to try something new. Applying for an ab initio course can be quite daunting, but the Tripos is tailored to ease you into the murky world of non-Romance languages, and once you overcome the initial hurdles (new alphabet, new sounds, new grammatical concepts) it can be endlessly exciting.The major benefit of an Asian and Middle Eastern Studies degree, especially when combined with Modern and Medieval Languages (in my case Spanish), is that you can gain exposure to papers from a range of subjects and Faculties. The University may classify you as a linguist but the term is perhaps reductive, as you’ll undoubtedly end up a philosopher, historian, literary critic, translator, interpreter and even ethnographer at some point during your degree. During my four years at Cambridge I’ve taken modules in everything from Latin American cinema to Islamic travel writing, political anthropology to Portuguese modern art. As someone with wide-ranging academic interests, the course afforded me constant opportunities to explore different areas, and build on the other subjects I studied during Part IB (2nd year).When the time came to choose a Year Abroad destination I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of options - between Arabic-speaking and Spanish-speaking countries, I had a large proportion of the globe to choose from. Eventually I decided on Cairo, hailed as the cultural hub of the Middle East despite its ongoing political and civil unrest. The experience was endlessly exciting, often bizarre and certainly never dull. I managed to get an internship with the Regional Arts team of the British Council, helping facilitate projects across the 17 countries of the Middle East and North Africa, and it was a fantastic opportunity to meet passionate artists, entrepreneurs and social activists from the region. In particular I was tasked with making two documentary films, organizing three ‘Cultural Leadership and Innovation’ conferences in Dubai, Beirut and Cairo and translating a script into Arabic for a collaborative performance project with the National Theatre of Tripoli. Outside of work, life was a whirlwind of the absurd and the sublime. Cairo is a city that never stops, in fact it rarely pauses for breath, but if you approach it with a bit of gumption it can provide infinite opportunities. Over the 8 months I was there I joined an Arabic band, appeared in a KFC advert, went stargazing in the Sinai, trekked with the Bedouins, scuba-dived in Dahab, learned to train camels, worked as a journalist at the Cairo International Film Festival, founded a book group and took salsa lessons - to name but a few activities! Having feared my interests might be incompatible with Egyptian society, it ended up being one of the most interesting and eye-opening experiences I’ve ever had, and if all goes well I plan to return after graduation.The Middle East has been at the forefront of global affairs in recent years, and will undoubtedly continue to feature not only in the political sphere, but in international business and culture as well. For me, studying Arabic is a way to engage with these rapidly-changing events as they happen, and feel a part of the action on an entirely different level.""I am a second year undergraduate studying Arabic in the AMES Faculty, in combination with French in the Modern and Medieval Languages Faculty. After finding out that in combining two languages from two faculties I was setting out to "do two degrees packed into the same time as one", I felt somewhat daunted. However, this combination has allowed the diversity and broadness of study that most other Cambridge degrees could not provide. This year, for instance, I find myself in the library juggling Taha Hussein's autobiography, Al-Ayyam, French linguistics textbooks, and ethnographies of the Middle East. It is rather exciting, after a year of intensively studying the Arabic language, to be let loose on the range of papers the department of Middle Eastern Studies has to offer. Yet, I feel strongly that without having spent those many hours memorising long lists of vocabulary and the seemingly unending rules of Arabic grammar, it would impossible to study effectively, or to any level of deeper understanding, the literature, politics, history, or culture of Arab societies. This ideal is central to degrees in the Middle East Studies department, and it is something I really value. Over my first year-and-a-bit studying Arabic I have particularly enjoyed the change from school language learning, where progress was slow and the language focused towards "getting-by". Instead, in Cambridge, the process is much more rewarding, if considerably more demanding, as the majority of the basics of grammar, and a substantial amount of vocabulary, are packed into the first three 8-week terms. This meant that last summer, after studying the language only a year, I was able to travel to Jordan, along with a group of my fellow Arabists, where we were able not only to admire the tourist attractions, but indeed to visit people's homes, have conversations, go to cafes off the beaten tourist track and really engage with Jordanian social and cultural life. Such a confidence in the spoken language is the direct result of weekly classes in colloquial Arabic - the aspect of my course I have found the most challenging, but equally which will, in practice, be most useful. Certainly, as I contemplate the options for my year abroad in the Middle East, I am increasingly grateful for all that preparation!"© 2017 University of Cambridge

But East Asia as a geopolitical and cultural region is a relatively recent invention in the Western imagination (it used to be called 'the Far East', as opposed to 'the Near East' or 'the Middle East'; or 'the (Extreme) Orient'). With the rise in influence of East Asia in global affairs and the increasingly recognised importance of East Asian civilisations the demand for expertise on East Asia is on the rise. The Department of East Asian Studies (DEAS) runs two full degree courses: Chinese Studies and Japanese Studies, aiming at providing undergraduate students with solid language abilities in the chosen language as well as a deep understanding of the region through its history, politics, culture, philosophy, and literature. The skills that you obtain will open up a wide range of career options, as East Asian language skills provide a foundation for further study (in Chinese Studies, Japanese Studies or other academic or professional training programmes) and work in fields such as art and museums, the performing arts, translation, business, diplomacy, law, and journalism. Cambridge students who graduate with a strong foundation in the languages, history, and politics of these countries are well prepared to find their place in the burgeoning market in business, ideas, and cultures of East Asia. They are also well prepared to continue to advanced degrees.An essential element of the BA in Chinese or Japanese studies is the year you spend abroad in China or Japan. It is here that classroom learning comes to life, as you are given an opportunity to live amongst and communicate with native speakers. The year abroad enables you to consolidate your language skills, and to gain a deeper appreciation for the cultures and history of your chosen country.The Department of East Asian Studies holds Undergraduate Open Days in mid-March and early July each year. The Open Day provides an excellent opportunity to meet academic staff from the Department and to ask any questions that you might have about our courses.Further information about postgraduate courses at the Department may be found in our Graduate Studies section.@JapanWorldCam onTwitterJapan and the World on  Facebook© 2017 University of Cambridge

Great! Then you have no excuse to not apply!'     Sarah Eisenacher, current third-year student, 2017 Chinese is spoken by one-fifth of the world's population (though most Chinese people speak some form of dialect and learn standard mandarin and acquire literacy in Chinese in school), and more and more young people all over the world are learning Chinese. But the language is only a means towards a much more important goal, that is, to be able to access a fascinating world through the medium of its own language and conceptions. The BA in Chinese Studies at Cambridge will provide you with extensive abilities in the modern Chinese language, a solid grounding in classical and literary Chinese, and a critical understanding of the rich variety of Chinese culture. You will experience an exceptional challenge that will equip you for rewarding careers and a lifetime of appreciation of the vibrant living tradition of China and Chinese communities worldwide.Although prior knowledge of Chinese is not a prerequisite for the course, imagination, perseverance, and a sense of adventure are essential! We are looking for students who can demonstrate a serious commitment to learning about this vital, and politically and economically important, part of the world. Our curriculum caters to students learning Chinese from scratch (ab initio) as well as those who have done some substantial Chinese in secondary school (e.g. GCSE, A-level, IB, pre-U, etc.). However, this course is not suited for native speakers of Chinese.To study China, the Chinese language and Chinese culture is a tremendously fascinating challenge. The Cambridge course offers depth and breadth across many topics but it is equally true that no four-year course can cover each and every aspect or academic discipline related to China. It is important therefore that you study carefully whether our course is right for you. The Chinese Studies BA  requires a commitment to very intensive language work; alongside learning modern spoken Chinese (Mandarin) and written Chinese (in both simplified and non-simplified forms, which is why the Chinese welcoming phrase at the top of this page is in both simplified and traditional characters), the study of classical and literary forms of the Chinese language is a required component of the course in all four years. We do not teach Chinese for you to only be able to ask for directions when visiting China as a tourist, order dishes in a Chinese restaurant (though that is an important skill!), or negotiate a business deal with a Chinese company (though many of our alumni have done very well in the 'real world' of business and government). We hope that you will build the necessary foundations for a life-long engagement with, and enjoyment of, things Chinese. This course demands dedication and hard work. You need to envision yourself spending long hours (for four years!) learning and mastering the Chinese language (literary as well as modern), as well as reading and thinking about Chinese history, literature, art, anthropology, religion, philosophy, etc. Even though the course has a definitive structure, there are plenty of built-in flexibility and paper choices to allow each student to pursue his or her own inclinations (emphasising more on pre-modern or contemporary China, literature and cinema or anthropology and politics, etc.).A note on joint degrees. Many universities now offer the option of joint degrees, allowing the students to combine Chinese (usually only modern Chinese in simplified characters and up to the intermediate level) with another subject (e.g. law, business, history, politics, economics, linguistics, etc.). The increasing popularity of these joint degrees might reflect the 'hedging one's bets' and 'covering all the bases' mentality of many young people today (as well as that of their parents and career advisers), who think that 'more' must mean 'better', and that 'two' must appeal more to prospective employers than 'one'. However, we believe that an integrated Chinese Studies programme such as ours will produce graduates with genuine proficiency in the Chinese language and sophisticated understanding of China whom all prospective employers in need of China-related expertise will find attractive. Whatever other skills they might need they can easily acquire through on-the-job training.Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Here is a detailed description of the Chinese Studies course structure and study-abroad arrangement.What our current and former students are saying about our programme: student testimonials.What careers do we prepare you for: career opportunities.Details on the application process and admissions interviews.

However, there are two key differences that you should be aware of. At Cambridge, the application process starts earlier to allow time for interviews to be organised. You will also be asked to specify a College as well as naming your chosen degree subject in the application.While most of our students are UK nationals, we strongly encourage young people from other countries to also apply to us. In the past few years some of our students have hailed from Ireland and continental Europe (e.g. Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, the Netherlands) as well as farther afield (Australia and the USA).Please note that Brexit will not affect the tuition fees (during the whole course of their studies) of those EU applicants who apply for 2018 entry. [Here on tuition fees]All undergraduate admissions decisions are the responsibility of the Cambridge Colleges so check College websites for College-specific requirements (please check section below on how to choose colleges). Typical offers require: A-Level: A*AA; IB: 40-41 points, with 776 at Higher LevelNote: Chinese can be one of the three A-level subjects, but the A* can be in any of the three subjects.[We understand that some applicants might feel apprehensive about the A-Level A*AA requirement, which is a Cambridge-wide requirement, but we hope that you will work hard to make the required grades rather than turn away from a course that you really want to pursue.]Starting with the 2016 round of applications, all applicants are required to take the pre-interview written assessment for AMES at an authorised centre local to them (for a lot of applicants, this will be their school/college).Section 1 Reading Comprehension (60 minutes)Section 2 Essay/text response element (60 minutes)Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment SpecificationYou must be registered in advance (separately to your UCAS application) to take the assessment – the registration deadline for the 2018 admissions round is 15 October, 2017. Your assessment centre must register you for the pre-interview assessment; you’re not able to register yourself.The pre-interview written assessment for AMES will be taken on 2 November, 2017 (Thursday). Please check the Admissions Testing Service website for scheduled start times.Please note that your performance in the pre-interview assessment will not be considered in isolation, but will be taken into account alongside the other elements of your application. A specimen paper has been produced to allow you to sample the written assessment format and practice under timed conditions. It is not expected that you will answer every question correctly; the written assessment is designed to be challenging. Even some strong candidates may not  complete the paper in the time allowed; it is designed to distinguish across our field of high-calibre applicants.Experience with similar assessments and from trials indicates that, on average, typical applicants to the most highly selective undergraduate courses (who are by definition academically very able) will gain approximately half of the available marks. The best applicants will score more highly, but only relatively few are expected to gain more than 80% of the available marks.Written assessments help admissions tutors to assess whether candidates have the skills, aptitudes and any required subject knowledge and understanding required to study the relevant course at Cambridge. They are only one of the elements used in the admissions process. Others include a candidate’s academic record and forecast grades in school-leaving examinations; UCAS application form; examples of recent written work submitted to the College to which they are applying; and performance at interview, if invited to attend.Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Text BookletAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Answer SheetAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Answer KeyAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 1 Explained AnswersAsian and Middle Eastern Studies Admissions Assessment Specimen Paper Section 2More information on admissions requirements can be found here.In your College you will have a Director of Studies who will be responsible for your academic welfare and for your progress. In most other subjects your Director of Studies also arranges your supervisions, but in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies supervisions are arranged by your teachers in the Faculty.Students choosing Chinese Studies and wondering which College to apply to should be aware that members of the Chinese Studies academic staff are Fellows of the following Colleges. In most cases they act as Director of Studies (DoS) for all students in their Colleges doing Chinese Studies as well as other subjects within Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. In other colleges your Director of Studies is likely to be a specialist in Middle Eastern Studies, Japanese or South Asian Studies. Having a Chinese Studies DoS in your own college would mean that you will have much readier access to help and advice if needed.In addition to talking to you about your personal statement, interviewers will want to know why you want to study the language and culture on which you will be spending the next four years of your life (and even beyond Cambridge). Before your interview you will need to do some exploratory reading about China and to be prepared to talk about your reading in the interview. This can include general history, literature in translation and other reading that relates to your main interest in China. Wikipedia (which is not always a trustworthy source) and other internet sources alone are not good enough, though they can often serve as convenient entry points to more proper and scholarly sources.You will find some reading recommendations in our section on 'Preparatory Reading'. You will impress the interviewers positively if you can demonstrate your commitment to pursuing Chinese Studies by having done some relevant readings and having watched some Chinese films.Each applicant will have two interview sessions, each lasting approximately 25-30 minutes. The 'general interview' is often conducted by the College admissions tutor and another Fellow of the College, both of whom are most likely non-China specialists. This interview's aim is to assess the applicant's general academic and intellectual aptitudes. The 'subject interview' is usually conducted by two members of the Chinese Studies staff, one of whom can be the Director of Studies for AMES subjects for the College. This interview's aim is to assess the applicant's suitability for the Chinese Studies course. The interviewers will write up reports on the interviews that will serve as an important basis for the admissions decisions at the College to which the applicant has applied and/or at the admissions pool in the event that the applicant is considered suitable for the course but the College in question does not have enough space for the applicant. All highly-qualified and suitable applicants will have a fair chance of getting admitted no matter which college they have applied to (though we suggest you consider first and foremost those colleges with Chinese Studies staff members as fellows and/or directors of studies for AMES subjects).No one should be intimidated by the interview. There are many resources to help you familiarise yourself with the interview process.

Some have joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, or international scientific or welfare agencies. Others have entered large business concerns based in London or in East Asia. Some of our graduates have become journalists, widely read for their reports on current events in the People's Republic of China. Others have become teachers in Britain, North America, Hong Kong, Japan and Europe. Still others have joined the staffs of major museums and libraries. One even runs a successful travel agency specialising in China tours.Very few graduates have set aside Chinese to take up work unrelated to China; they have preferred instead to employ the skills learned in the Cambridge course for distinctive and highly rewarding careers. Studying Chinese at Cambridge is not only fascinating, but it also helps you develop an invaluable set of skills. The rigorous course, the broad range of subjects covered and the opportunity to immerse yourself in a different culture really do make a unique and rewarding experience.Small classes mean a greater sense of community and support - both classmates and staff encouraged me to achieve the most I could from my studies. In particular, I co-wrote and published an academic article [article here] with my dissertation supervisor – something I never thought I would be doing as an undergraduate!Every day I use what I have learned at Cambridge in my work. At the UK Department for International Development, I depend upon the analytical skills and ability to quickly understand new topics that I gained from AMES. Within the Department I work in the trade policy team, looking into how international trade can benefit developing countries. In this work an understanding of China, the world’s second largest economy, has proven invaluable and I firmly believe these skills will continue to support me in my future career. "I chose Chinese Studies because I love a challenge, and relished the idea of a course that provided such a rich insight into an extraordinary country. I studied a mix of disciplines at A-level (Ancient Greek, Maths, History and Politics), so the breadth of the course also appealed to me. My time in the Faculty was everything I'd hoped for and more. By the time I reached my third year, which is when I spent six months at Beijing University, the focus of my interest was international relations. I decided to write my dissertation on Chinese-African relations, and after some persistent cold-calls and emails, I landed an internship in the political section of the European Commissions Delegation in Beijing that summer.My time at the Delegation led me to realise that I would be better suited to work in a business with commercially-driven goals, and so during my final year (in 2008) I sought a training contract with an international law firm that had shown a particular focus on China. I loved my two years there, particularly the six months I spent in the firm's Hong Kong office, but at the end of the two years I realised that none of the departments quite felt like the right fit for me. Fate then played a wonderfully-timed hand, and I received a call from a US singer's manager who had often seen me at gigs in previous years. He asked me if I wanted to be a music lawyer. Ive now been a music lawyer for over a year in a niche law firm and am loving every minute, looking forward to the moment when we can fully realise the potential of the music market in China.""Having graduated in 1997 with a joint BA in Chinese and History, I went on to complete an MPhil and PhD in modern Chinese literature at the Faculty in Cambridge, and studied also at the Johns Hopkins Center for Chinese Studies in Nanjing and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. I am now Senior Lecturer in Modern Chinese History at Birkbeck College, University of London. Since graduating, I have published three books on the links between modern Chinese culture and national identity. I have also translated several works of modern Chinese fiction into English, including the complete short stories of Lu Xun for Penguin Classics.The Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies offered me an extraordinary education in the complexity and diversity of Chinese language, history and culture. Studying here laid the foundations for my subsequent career researching Chinese history and literature. The training that I received here provided me with linguistic and intellectual resources upon which I continue to draw today."© 2017 University of Cambridge

The course is taught by scholars and teachers who are actively engaged in research and publication and by native speakers of Chinese. Its overall aim is to train undergraduates in both the modern and pre-modern forms of Chinese, and to give them a well-informed understanding of China through learning its language, literature, religions, history, society and politics. The course gives students an understanding of both traditional and modern Chinese society and how China’s past has informed, and continues to impact, much of its present, and provides students with a skill set that enables them to analyse China through its own language(s) and sources. The course has five main components and aims to obtain the following learning outcomes:                        The Chinese language is taught from scratch at Cambridge, so the course requires no prior knowledge of the language. A GCSE or A-level in Chinese may give some indication of your motivation and commitment to the subject, but it is by no means a requirement. The course comprises a wide range of cultural, historical, and literary papers that require analytical skills beyond basic language training.For those applicants doing A-level, Chinese can be one of the three A-level subjects, and the A* can be in any of the three subjects. Once offered a place in our programme (normally sometime in January of the year of matriculation), it is important for you to do some exploratory reading about China, which will make it much easier for you to assimilate the enormous amount of information with which you will be presented in your first year (and you will soon find out that the efficacy of your language-learning is very much heightened by your knowledge about Chinese history, society and culture).What if you have performed well in A-level Chinese or have taken quite a bit of Chinese before coming to Cambridge (especially since many secondary schools now offer courses on Chinese as a foreign language)? On very rare occasions, we have tested the student’s Chinese abilities and decided that she or he could begin with second-year Chinese (Part IB). However, in most cases of students with some substantial prior exposure to Chinese (still a minority amongst our students but increasingly common) they will still begin with the first-year course (Part IA) and find it challenging and interesting. This is because there are so many other components in the first-year course in addition to modern Chinese. They will do the East Asia history survey paper (EAS1) that involves reading (lots of reading!), lectures, essay-writing, seminar discussions and supervisions; they will begin learning classical/literary Chinese in the Lent term (i.e. the second term); they will have to learn how to recognise and write in both simplified and non-simplified (i.e. traditional) characters. Even in modern Chinese learning they will find their advantage over those starting from scratch quickly disappearing in the first year because of the quick pace of the language course. Another scenario could be that such students can skip some of the first-year modern Chinese language papers (C1, C2 and C3) but will be challenged and kept busy by alternative language training, special supervisions and projects all the while taking the other essential first-year papers (East Asian History and Literary Chinese). Please note that the BA in Chinese Studies is not suitable for native speakers of Chinese.You are advised to put only one subject (i.e. Chinese Studies) on your application form. You cannot combine Chinese Studies with Japanese Studies (because such a combination is only considered under special circumstances) or with any MML subjects.The course is four years in duration, and is divided into two parts. Part I, lasting two years, will provide you with a thorough grounding in reading, writing and speaking modern standard Chinese (putonghua), in reading literary and classical Chinese, and in Chinese and East Asian history from ancient to modern times. In Part II, you spend your third year in China. In your final year, you continue with intensive language work in both modern and literary Chinese and concentrate on a special subject (contemporary society, modern literature and film, modern history, dynastic China, linguistics, politics). You will also work on a 12,000-word dissertation on a topic of your choice.One of the distinctive strengths of Cambridge teaching is the supervision system, in which you have the opportunity to test out your ideas with a member of academic staff. We see this as a critical part of the pedagogical process, and expect you to participate in a genuine dialogue in which you should feel free to challenge us as much as we, inevitably, will challenge you. In the first year you will have supervisions for language and for history, usually in pairs or small groups. Unlike larger subjects that are well represented in the colleges, we arrange supervisions centrally through the Faculty to ensure that all students reading Chinese Studies receive an equal amount of attention, regardless of what college they are in.During your first year, the main part of your time will be spent learning modern Chinese. You will have covered its basic grammar and have acquired a substantial active and passive vocabulary. You will also receive an introduction to East Asian history, from antiquity to the present, with break-out sessions zooming in on topics specific to China. This course is taken by all students studying Chinese and Japanese. In addition you will start learning literary Chinese through reading classical texts from the pre-imperial and early imperial period, mainly (but not exclusively) focused on philosophy. In addition, you will prepare for an examination in spoken Chinese. The following are the compulsory language papers: Modern Chinese Translation and Writing 1, Modern Chinese Texts 1, and Literary Chinese 1.You may expect to receive around seventeen hours of teaching per week at the Faculty, in the form of lectures, seminars, and supervisions.During the second year, your intensive training in modern Chinese will allow you to start tackling original material (so-called ‘authentic texts’), including extracts from novels, newspapers, and other forms of literary production. You will have the opportunity to delve more deeply into Chinese history through a paper in pre-modern and modern history (one of which is compulsory, though both can be taken).  In literary Chinese you will learn to read traditional Chinese poetry, and have a taste of fiction and historical writing from dynastic China. There is also provision for you to choose from a number of other content courses.You will take the following compulsory modules: Modern Chinese Translation and Writing 2, Modern Chinese Texts 2, Literary Chinese 2; plus two of the following: History of Dynastic China*, Globalisation in China, 1850 to present*, Japanese History, Japanese Literary Modernity, Japanese Society, Japanese Politics, Cinema East, Structure and Meanings (from the Modern and Medieval Languages Tripos) (* Denotes papers where at least one must be chosen).You may expect to receive up to fifteen hours of teaching per week at the Faculty during your second year.Please note that, while core papers will always be available, the Faculty reserves the right to suspend any elective paper in a given academic year.You will be required to spend at least eight months in China during your third year, attending courses at either Peking University in Beijing or the Ocean University of China in Qingdao.The object of the year abroad is to increase fluency and understanding of the language, and to provide the opportunity to start work on a dissertation, which must show evidence of a substantial use of Chinese language sources, whether oral or textual.When you return from China for your fourth year, you will have a core curriculum in both modern and literary Chinese, and a number of special subject options. These options reflect the expertise of the teaching staff, and they give students an opportunity to study a particular period or subject within Chinese Studies in a far more focused manner. Options available include papers on modern literature, modern history, dynastic China, China’s role in the international order, contemporary society, and language and linguistics. Note that not all options will be available in a given academic year but you will always have a choice of a minimum of three. A dissertation of 12,000 words is also a requirement, giving the students the opportunity to engage in original research and the challenge to produce a substantial piece of scholarship (individually supervised by a dissertation supervisor). Dissertations can (but need not) be connected with one’s special subject paper, or they can simply be on a topic of interest not covered in depth elsewhere.You may expect to receive up to twelve hours of teaching per week at the Faculty during your fourth year. There will also be supervision meetings with your supervisor on your dissertation research.The Chinese Studies course is demanding and intensive. Given the nature of the Chinese language, it requires a strong commitment to continuous, and often time-consuming, language work that includes a substantial amount of memorisation. You should expect having to work a minimum of 20 to 25 hours per week outside your classes, lectures, and supervisions. But think of the pleasure and satisfaction that come with, and after, the hard work!According to existing faculty regulations, it is possible to combine Japanese with Chinese Studies at Cambridge (but only in exceptional circumstances and with permission of the Faculty Board). Chinese is already a very challenging language, and we would prefer our students achieve a high level of Chinese proficiency (vernacular and literary) as well as adequate exposure to Chinese history, culture and society rather than graduating with only an intermediate-level competence.If you decide to combine Japanese with Chinese Studies, you will have to forego your study-abroad experience in China in the third year and do introductory Japanese in Cambridge. Not spending a year in China and spending most of your third year studying Japanese (which is also a very difficult language) would inevitably mean that your Chinese proficiency will suffer, and you will also miss out on personally experiencing Chinese society and culture in an intimate and sustained manner. [Since some of the students leave for China in early July and come back to the UK in late September the next year they can be spending as many as 15 months in China, which often include extensive travels in the country and/or volunteering in NGOs and doing internships.] If you combine Japanese with Chinese Studies you will also be deprived of the pleasure and challenge of researching and writing the undergraduate dissertation on a topic of your choice.You are advised to put only one subject (i.e. Chinese Studies) on your application form. Though we would of course encourage our students to pursue the study of other languages and cultures in their spare time, we strongly believe a dedicated and focused approach to Chinese Studies will yield the best outcome. Please note that currently Japanese is the only language that can be combined with Chinese Studies according to existing regulations. You are not able to study Korean as an option (Japanese Studies students have the option to study introductory Korean because Japanese and Korean are grammatically cognate languages).© 2017 University of Cambridge

Great! Then you have no excuse to not apply!'     Sarah Eisenacher, current third-year student, 2017 Chinese is spoken by one-fifth of the world's population (though most Chinese people speak some form of dialect and learn standard mandarin and acquire literacy in Chinese in school), and more and more young people all over the world are learning Chinese. But the language is only a means towards a much more important goal, that is, to be able to access a fascinating world through the medium of its own language and conceptions. The BA in Chinese Studies at Cambridge will provide you with extensive abilities in the modern Chinese language, a solid grounding in classical and literary Chinese, and a critical understanding of the rich variety of Chinese culture. You will experience an exceptional challenge that will equip you for rewarding careers and a lifetime of appreciation of the vibrant living tradition of China and Chinese communities worldwide.Although prior knowledge of Chinese is not a prerequisite for the course, imagination, perseverance, and a sense of adventure are essential! We are looking for students who can demonstrate a serious commitment to learning about this vital, and politically and economically important, part of the world. Our curriculum caters to students learning Chinese from scratch (ab initio) as well as those who have done some substantial Chinese in secondary school (e.g. GCSE, A-level, IB, pre-U, etc.). However, this course is not suited for native speakers of Chinese.To study China, the Chinese language and Chinese culture is a tremendously fascinating challenge. The Cambridge course offers depth and breadth across many topics but it is equally true that no four-year course can cover each and every aspect or academic discipline related to China. It is important therefore that you study carefully whether our course is right for you. The Chinese Studies BA  requires a commitment to very intensive language work; alongside learning modern spoken Chinese (Mandarin) and written Chinese (in both simplified and non-simplified forms, which is why the Chinese welcoming phrase at the top of this page is in both simplified and traditional characters), the study of classical and literary forms of the Chinese language is a required component of the course in all four years. We do not teach Chinese for you to only be able to ask for directions when visiting China as a tourist, order dishes in a Chinese restaurant (though that is an important skill!), or negotiate a business deal with a Chinese company (though many of our alumni have done very well in the 'real world' of business and government). We hope that you will build the necessary foundations for a life-long engagement with, and enjoyment of, things Chinese. This course demands dedication and hard work. You need to envision yourself spending long hours (for four years!) learning and mastering the Chinese language (literary as well as modern), as well as reading and thinking about Chinese history, literature, art, anthropology, religion, philosophy, etc. Even though the course has a definitive structure, there are plenty of built-in flexibility and paper choices to allow each student to pursue his or her own inclinations (emphasising more on pre-modern or contemporary China, literature and cinema or anthropology and politics, etc.).A note on joint degrees. Many universities now offer the option of joint degrees, allowing the students to combine Chinese (usually only modern Chinese in simplified characters and up to the intermediate level) with another subject (e.g. law, business, history, politics, economics, linguistics, etc.). The increasing popularity of these joint degrees might reflect the 'hedging one's bets' and 'covering all the bases' mentality of many young people today (as well as that of their parents and career advisers), who think that 'more' must mean 'better', and that 'two' must appeal more to prospective employers than 'one'. However, we believe that an integrated Chinese Studies programme such as ours will produce graduates with genuine proficiency in the Chinese language and sophisticated understanding of China whom all prospective employers in need of China-related expertise will find attractive. Whatever other skills they might need they can easily acquire through on-the-job training.Here is a webpage that integrates various sections of faculty websites relating to Chinese Studies (including a section on news) Here is a detailed description of the Chinese Studies course structure and study-abroad arrangement.What our current and former students are saying about our programme: student testimonials.What careers do we prepare you for: career opportunities.Details on the application process and admissions interviews.

Literary Chinese was the main language of written communication across East Asia from antiquity until the early twentieth century. ‘Classical’ Chinese strictly speaking refers to the language of the Chinese Classics but you will hear students and teachers often refer to all formal ways of writing in Chinese prior to the early 20th century as ‘classical’. (In China it is referred to as gudai hanyu 古代漢語 ‘ancient/pre-modern Chinese’). Literary Chinese was the principal vehicle of culture in China and East Asia for many centuries. It was the ‘lingua franca’ (a universal literary and administrative language) among the educated classes. Its impact and reach therefore can be compared to that of Latin and French during large parts of European history or indeed English today. The ability to write and read texts written in literary Chinese continues to be a defining feature of the educated person in Chinese societies.Note that wenyan is not fundamentally spoken, albeit that reciting, memorising and quoting from famous texts was, and still is, common practice. Modern Mandarin, in both spoken and written form, is peppered with a vast amount of vocabulary, proverbs, analogies and anecdotal references borrowed from literary Chinese. At least from our modern point of view today, literary Chinese is a language that is primarily to be seen and read and not be heard (with poetry as a possible exception). Therefore spoken Mandarin and literary Chinese are two different linguistic media, and it is essential to master both in order to plumb below the surface level of your encounter with Chinese civilisation. Literary Chinese is much more than a simplified or ‘essential’ transcription of speech. In fact you will find that you will be able to read about topics, ideas, and themes in the literary language much earlier and at a more advanced level than you will be able to do in Modern Mandarin.  At Cambridge we teach literary Chinese as a required part of the core curriculum in each of the four years you spend with us (including the year abroad). In the first year, after you have had a term of intensive modern Mandarin, we start with excerpts from China’s most famous philosophers from the classical period (including thinkers such as Confucius 孔子, Mencius 孟子, and Zhuangzi 莊子). We add to these stories and anecdotes from the same period, as they provide the best way into the basic grammar of how the language works. With the philosophers under the belt, you will then learn how to read traditional Chinese poetry in the second year with highlights from the Han 漢 and Tang 唐 periods. You will also learn in your second year to read ‘fiction’ in literary Chinese, ranging from medieval tales of the fantastic to a late imperial diary, and indeed, a spot of Sherlock Holmes! You will continue honing your literary-Chinese skills while doing the year-abroad in China, covering a range of texts including chapters from the most famous novels of the Ming 明 and Qing 清 dynasties (e.g. 紅樓夢 The Dream of the Red Chamber). In the fourth year, when you return from your year abroad, you will have all tools to tackle a selection of writings that represent the incredibly vast corpus of genres in the literary language that China has produced. On the menu will be a selection that includes passages from a medical treatise, Buddhist stories, a military treatise, Song dynasty literary genres and travel literature.Classes in literary Chinese combine language learning and an engagement with the content and context in which the texts were produced. We read authentic texts in the original language but also talk about their historical and social background. Thus literary Chinese classes are just as much about the language as about traditional Chinese culture and society.  Literary Chinese is by no means a ‘dead’ language (like Latin or ancient Greek). Despite attempts by the New Culture Movement during the May Fourth period (ca. 1915-1921) to abolish its official use in favour of a more vernacular Chinese, the literary language continues to permeate the Chinese language and Chinese culture at large. In fact, as we speak, China is witnessing the most rigorous revival in its own pre-modern tradition and in contrast with the previous decades this tradition is now a source of national pride and increasingly part of modern cultural identity. In short, literary Chinese has left and continues to leave a DNA imprint on Chinese culture at various levels. Modern Mandarin is replete with idioms, allusions, and analogies that derive from traditional culture written in wenyan. Chinese art and calligraphy are only the most obvious media where literary Chinese continues to be used on a daily basis, but classical references—often cited directly in the original language—are often used in speeches delivered by diplomats, politicians and other public figures.  While not all university courses in Chinese Studies expose students to literary Chinese, most full-time Chinese Studies programs in the UK and Europe will train students in literary Chinese as part of their regular curriculum. At Cambridge we believe that training in literary Chinese is as essential to the aspiring China specialist as calculus is to a mathematician, Shakespeare to a student of English, or anatomy to a student of medicine. Literary Chinese permeates every aspect of traditional Chinese culture, as well as the modern language. Without it, not only would you not be able to read any document produced prior to the early 20th century but, even more importantly, you would not be able to detect its impact on literary and everyday expressions today. Whether you are interested in literature, art, poetry, linguistics, history, law, philosophy or simply wish to read newspapers, decipher traffic signs and restaurant menus, party slogans, TV subtitles or advertising billboards,  you will need literary Chinese.By learning wenyan you will have the linguistic tools necessary to connect with the past and appreciate the richness of the written tradition that to a large extent defines modern Chinese identity. Even when speaking or reading modern Chinese, you will be able to recognise allusions and references that otherwise would remain hidden from you, and to detect the subtleties of irony, humour or sarcasm they meant to convey. By studying literary Chinese, you will enable yourself to understand modern Chinese speech or writing at a deeper level, and you will get a proper feel of how to write in Chinese beyond reproducing colloquial Chinese.The past is never completely gone. It lives on as a cultural tradition that determines the identity of a people today. Language is part of this tradition and is thus an essential component of modern culture. This is especially the case in Chinese where written sources from former time periods have been the backbone of literary education for the past two millennia and continue to be so today as soon as children begin learning to read and write.  On a most immediate level, learning literary Chinese will enable you to engage with an extremely diverse range of material, including administrative documents, historiographical works, religious scriptures, novels and other literary genres, letters, medical and divination treatises, books on military strategy, personal diaries, official correspondence, gazetteers and early newspapers. The ability to read the language gives you access to a vast body of sources, only a fraction of which is available in translation (in modern Chinese or Western languages).On a daily level, you will be able to fully understand historical films and novels which increasingly rely on literary Chinese to convey a sense of historical authenticity and to connect with the elite culture of the past. You will notice the implicit connections with the past and understand what is implied by those connections. When learning quotes and proverbs commonly used in modern speech, you will be able to understand what they mean exactly, rather than having to memorise random strings of syllables.In sum, learning literary Chinese is an essential tool for tapping into deeper layers of Chinese culture and is simply indispensable for a thorough understanding of China, regardless of whether you are studying pre-modern or modern China, or whether you are interested in the future transformations of this ever-changing yet resolutely tradition-minded civilisation!  © 2017 University of Cambridge

Although competence in communication in a language involves more than just linguistic competence, linguistic competence is nevertheless an essential element in communicative competence. As our students are learning Chinese in an English-speaking environment, it is difficult for them to acquire the grammatical rules intuitively. With this in mind, we adopt a proportional approach in designing our Modern Chinese Programme.In the 1st year, we put more emphasis on linguistic forms (e.g. grammar, lexicon, etc.) in order to provide our students with basic tools for using the Chinese language. This emphasis on linguistic forms gradually decreases in later years as non-formal components (e.g. functions, themes, etc.) are given correspondingly more prominence. The 1st year is treated as a transitional stage between language learning in secondary schools, where vocabulary and structure lists are provided, and language learning at the university level, where the aim is to train the student to become an independent user of the language. Although grammar instruction is still provided after the 1st year, the teaching focus will be more on the use, rather than the grammatical rules, of the language. Language materials used in the 1st year are simplified for pedagogical purposes, but authentic materials are gradually introduced afterwards.Our Modern Chinese Programme aims at providing students with all the communicative skills necessary for them to function in Chinese-speaking communities, which include listening, speaking, reading, writing, translating and interpreting. It is recognised that students may have various professions and occupations in mind for their future career and may wish to learn business Chinese, Chinese for diplomacy, etc. which may not be taught specifically in our Modern Chinese Programme. However, we believe that a solid foundation in common-core Chinese is essential for students to pursue their future study of Chinese. It gives them an advanced proficiency in the language that is transferable to any specific field of language use or professional walk of life.We believe that the spontaneous use of language derives from subconscious or implicit knowledge, while conscious or explicit knowledge comes into play in situations where the focus is on form rather than meaning. Explicit knowledge here refers to the technical aspects of language, such as grammar, but we want to get students beyond the stage of reliance on explicit knowledge and promote their capacity for implicit knowledge. A consequence of this view is that activities designed to promote fluency should involve an emphasis on meaning. Drills are considered useful exercises in classroom teaching, particularly at early stages, but students benefit from an increasing number of activities designed to encourage creative and independent language use as they move to more advanced stages. These activities have the effect of (a) maximising opportunities for use; (b) creating a more natural environment; (c) simulating natural language settings and promoting the development of language-use strategies; (d) enabling students to convert what they have learned consciously into the subconscious knowledge which supports the spontaneous use of the language.Learning Chinese to an advanced level requires a huge commitment and investment in time on a daily basis. The proficiency we aim to achieve at Cambridge goes far beyond the utilitarian day-to-day use of Chinese one might wish to pick up to travel or to order a meal.  Students are required to commit to an amount of language work that will far exceed what they may have been used to in learning foreign languages in secondary schools. Likewise, once students have passed the initial stages, being able to look up and master vocabulary independently is an indispensable skill for anyone aspiring to be an expert user of Chinese. Do expect, therefore, to be working on your Chinese several hours each day inside and outside the classroom. In return, you will gain not only a linguistic and communicative proficiency that sets you up for life and is admired by your future employers, but, most importantly, you will learn to speak and ‘think’ Chinese and understand this fascinating culture and part of the world ‘from within’.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Although the study of non-Western cultures is still considered somewhat of a novelty amongst people in the UK, I can wholeheartedly say I have no regrets about the decision I made. Rather, I would urge more people to pursue the study of this fascinating and important country and embark on a truly unique path in life, full of adventures.The Cambridge course aims for you to reach an advanced proficiency in Modern Chinese by the end of the degree, which means the pace of learning is quick and intense. Learning to speak and write Chinese is by no means a small feat, but the sense of achievement is just as great. The small class sizes (typically no larger than 10 people) and supportive, high-quality teaching means your Chinese comes on in leaps and bounds term by term. I am really looking forward to reaping the rewards of my studies thus far during my upcoming year abroad in Beijing. The study of Classical Chinese alongside this deepens your intuitive understanding of the language as well as opening up the pleasures of reading pre-modern philosophy, prose and poetry in its original form.The course also allows you to study various aspects of East Asian culture alongside intensive language work. Over the last two years, I have covered topics ranging from post-war Korean cinema, to Heian Japan and even China's reaction to Brexit. The freedom to study many different academic fields under one degree is very exciting and the faculty will support you in pursuing whatever academic interest you may have. The small size of the faculty means you end up building very close relationships with your classmates and professors.Cambridge is a beautiful and comfortable city to live in, full of many interesting and ambitious people. The student community is really buzzing and there are so many things you can get involved with! Alongside my studies, I have found the time to help organise an international student film festival, take Spanish classes and keep up old interests in running and yoga. Whatever your interests, you are bound to find a society that suits you." Alexander Johnstone (2017, in his second year) "I had already had some experience with China before I joined AMES in October 2015. Particularly my gap year at a university in Hangzhou (a city you definitely need to visit if you haven’t yet) had equipped me with a fairly broad knowledge of not only the Chinese language but also Chinese society, history, and politics. Knowing some things is often, though arguably not always, useful. But don’t worry if at this point you can’t memorise the dates of all dynasties or every 5-year plan since 1953. Rather than amassing facts, I recommend that you use the time between now and the potential start of your degree to explore a wide variety of material on or from China. See how you like Chinese silent films from the 1930s, Little Apple from the Chopstick Brothers, or calligraphy from the Song Dynasty. If you can, spend some time in China (there are lots of funding opportunities through various bodies of the Chinese government), or pay a visit to museums exhibiting communist propaganda posters from the Cultural Revolution or other forms of high art. The point is: find out whether you can develop an interest in some aspect of China and its tradition that can keep you motivated throughout four years of intensive study. You have already come to the conclusion that nothing is more fun than immersing yourself with ‘things Chinese’? Great! Then you have no excuse to not apply!"                                                                                                                           Sarah Eisenacher (2017, in her second year) "I applied to study Chinese without any experience in the language, just French and Italian at A level and an interest in China. While some of my classmates had studied Chinese before (and if you have, go for it), most differences had evened out by end of first term. If like me you haven’t been able to study Chinese, Japanese, Arabic or Persian before, don’t worry. The course is designed for beginners and starting from scratch won’t hold you back."Aron White (2013) "The staff of the Department of East Asian Studies are inspiring and often very witty as well. Many of them are also well-known academics, so you're learning from some of the most knowledgeable people in the field. The faculty staff have always been very approachable and friendly in my experience, and none of us could have come so far without their help. I think it's also important to point out that the courses in the Department of East Asian Studies very much focus on independent learning, and what you do and how far you go is always up to you as a student."Hugh Grigg (2013)  "I don't remember exactly why I chose to study Chinese, but I like to tell people it's because I wanted to earwig at bus stops. The language is a fantastic challenge, but it's the way this is linked to history and culture which makes studying China quite so rewarding. AMES at Cambridge is a course that grounds you very thoroughly in every aspect of language, history and culture. To achieve this, the pace is intense from day one. I have mornings of classes and spend the afternoon reading, preparing or otherwise pouring over the many characters we are given to learn each week."Greg McMillan wrote this when he was a second-year student in 2013 "The highlight of my time at Cambridge was the second half of my degree - studying abroad at Peking University and doing Part II back at Cambridge. After two hard years of learning characters and getting the basics, I learnt how to put the language into practice and became more comfortable applying it to academic and professional pursuits. As our language improved, we had the freedom to pursue our interests, in my case modern history and politics. In my final year, with the assistance of faculty staff, I was able to publish two papers.After graduation I started work at a large e-commerce company in Manchester. I manage business development and manage a small team responsible for trading strategy. We improve the channels through which we sell cross border, and I help the company grow and understand  the opportunities and challenges in this diverse, complex market. I represent the company in China, leading negotiations with Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu and project-managing infrastructure development (i.e. customer service centres and warehousing).You leave AMES a generalist with an understanding of a region. This has its advantages, but also its challenges. I work as a bridge between two groups of specialists, but had to make mistakes and learn very fast to add value to this process, and now am trusted to solve the problems that that arise between these groups of people. Since you add genuine value and understanding, people seek you out to help them ‘do China’ in all kinds of industries. Studying at Cambridge puts you at an advantage against many others in this position. Firstly, because the AMES course gives you a thorough linguistic and cultural grounding, which joint degrees at other universities simply cannot. Secondly, because your final two years teach you to think, which is at the requirement at the core of managing the complex, multi-party, trans-cultural, fast-paced problems you encounter in commerce."Greg McMillan wrote this in 2017, after having graduated in 2016 When it came to choosing a subject to study at university, I was at first torn between Chinese and History as my main interest lay in Chinese history. Eventually, I decided that it would make little sense to study Chinese history without knowing Chinese and decided to apply to read Chinese in Cambridge. What was helpful was that I knew that the course in Cambridge would not only give me the chance to acquire a solid knowledge of the Chinese language, but also would give me the opportunity to develop my interest in Chinese history. Looking back now, I am certain I made the right decision. During my four years studying Chinese as an undergraduate, I developed a solid grasp of both modern and classical research. At the same time, the many history options the degree course offers allowed me to develop my interest in Chinese history. By the third year, I had developed an interest in the history of modern China, particularly the history of modern Sino-German relations. As a former German colony, Qingdao, where I spent my year abroad, proved the ideal place to further pursue this topic and start work on my final year dissertation. It was also in Qingdao that I decided to continue my research as a postgraduate after graduation, as I felt that there was much more I wanted to explore than what I could do in my undergraduate dissertation. During my fourth year, I wrote a dissertation on the German colonial presence in Qingdao and started to write applications for postgraduate study and funding.Luckily, I was eventually accepted to stay at FAMES to do a PhD on German banking in modern China, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (read more about this here: https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/chinese/phd/testimonies-of-past-and-current-students).  Even though life as a PhD student is very different from undergraduate life with much more freedom to pursue one’s interests, my training in Chinese language and Chinese history have been the basis for my postgraduate research. It would have been impossible to read original sources in Chinese and navigate the vast historiography in modern Chinese history without the solid training I received as an undergraduate student. The level of modern Chinese I acquired as an undergraduate also made it possible for me to present my research in Chinese at conferences in China and cooperate with Chinese colleagues.  Finally, writing my undergraduate dissertation gave me the basic skills that I could build on when writing my PhD dissertation. Graduating soon with my doctoral degree, I will move to Tokyo to continue my research on the history of China’s modern finance with a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Tokyo, funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The skills I gained as an undergraduate will not only continue to help me in my research but also prove valuable as I tackle the challenges presented by yet another new country and language.Ghassan Moazzin (Chinese Studies, 2008-2012)           © 2017 University of Cambridge

We are particularly pleased by the enthusiastic response from some older graduates, who show us how much their knowledge of Chinese language and Chinese culture has enriched their careers and lives. Where appropriate we have provided links to related sites.We are in the process of collecting more testimonies, especially from more recent graduates. Please contact Dr Adam Chau at ayc25@cam.ac.uk if you are a former student of the programme and wish to submit a testimony/reminiscence. Geoff Sampson, Oriental Studies, 1965 Current Job: Academic (retired)It was a different world.  China, then, did not feel like somewhere one might actually go to.  Our tiny undergraduate band were being let in on the secrets of a great civilization that, to almost any Brit, was a blank Terra Incognita.  I started learning Chinese as a schoolboy hobby, expecting to play with it for a few weeks, but soon I was hooked – when it came to university applications, I knew this was the subject for me.  I remember our first history lecture:  “There are three of us to teach you Chinese history, so we are taking a millennium each”.  By graduation I was convinced that every student ought to be required to study Sinology:  what other subject gives such a vivid sense of how unlike ours a successful human society can be?We were offered a linguistics option, and that hooked me too, so I left for graduate study in the USA which centred on linguistics, though I also took courses about a new kind of machine called computers.  Returning to Britain I climbed the academic ladder, eventually being appointed to a linguistics chair in 1984.  Halfway through my career, though, linguistics came to seem a discipline past its sell-by date.  I seized a chance to move into informatics, with periods of industrial research.  I reached retirement age teaching and writing about electronic business, and I.T. law. A nomadic career, then, but I never lost sight of Chinese – in 2006 I published a book of translations from the Book of Odes.I have been very lucky.  Thank you, Cambridge! John EverardCurrent Job: Retired Diplomat I chose Chinese studies by accident.  I started out studying Part 1 French and German but I got drunk at a party and told all my friends that I was going to switch to Chinese.  By the time I had sobered up the humiliation of backing out of this would have been too great, so I told a rather surprised Oriental faculty that I should be joining them.  I have never regretted the decision.  I was able to spend a year in Beijing University as one of only the third group of foreign students after the Cultural Revolution - a quite different China from that of today.  I was able to serve in the British Embassy in Beijing on two tours and I used my Chinese extensively during frequent breaks in Beijing from Pyongyang, my last FCO posting, and occasionally during my job coordinating the Panel of Experts on North Korea for the United Nations Security Council.  I still comment widely on Asian affairs and follow the ins and outs of Chinese foreign policy.  Hilary Lade, Class of 1976Studying Chinese gave me an experience different to all of my friends at Cambridge:  I was part of a small team with a huge amount of individual teaching contact, my teachers had amazing ‘back stories’ of experience outside academia and my eyes were opened to a culture that – just like Britain – had always considered itself to be the centre of the world – the ‘Central Kingdom’.  Studying Chinese may have taught me a language, but it introduced me to the world.I gained a Harkness Fellowship on leaving Cambridge and studied in the United States at Harvard and Berkeley, but academia wasn’t for me and I returned to the UK to join Shell, initially working on a coal project for China.  Shell however had many opportunities wider than China and I spent several very happy years travelling and trading cargoes of oil products – some in and out of China! – and then running a subsidiary company in the UK gas business.Many of life’s best breaks come about by a chance event and it was seeing an advertisement to run Fountains Abbey for the National Trust that took me out of the business world and into the charitable and public sector.  This then led to appointments as varied as Director of Historic Properties at English Heritage, the selection panel for the UK European Capital of Culture in 2008 and as a Board member at the Heritage Lottery Fund deciding on millions of pounds worth of investment at every meeting.  As the positions became non-executive (part time) rather than full time it has also left time to fulfil a lifelong dream of playing more music on the viola and sailing a small classic yacht (but not both at the same time!)Was this the career I expected when I interviewed at Cambridge to study Chinese?  No, but I have enough Chinese to travel off the beaten track and talk to local people in China, and Cambridge gave a background to the culture which helps to put China’s current and future position in the world into context.  And the career?  It’s been great fun. Christopher Homfray, Class of 1976Current Job: Adviser at NHS ScotlandWhen I came up to Cambridge in October 1976, Mao Zedong had been dead only a few weeks and the Cultural Revolution was just over.  China seemed a strange and mysterious place – well until, that is, my first essay on modern China was marked A- with the single comment “isn’t it all about bicycles?” So started a wonderful intellectual journey of discovery around the obvious truth that China and Chinese people are neither strange, nor mysterious nor inscrutable, but rather just different in all sorts of interesting ways. On graduating in 1980, I won a scholarship to study in northern China and had two years in Ji'nan and Beijing. After one year teaching Chinese near London, I was successful at CSSB and was appointed to the Hong Kong Government.My knowledge of China and of Mandarin, and then also Cantonese, was the foundation for a career in colonial government, followed by six years in consultancy in Hong Kong through the handover years. My China studies and experience also inspired a subsequent decade working in equality in NHS Scotland, and my current work with refugees in the British Red Cross in Glasgow, both of which revolve around cross-cultural experience and understanding. Stephen Jones, Class of 1976Current Job: Author, Ethnographer, Ethnomusicologist, BloggerIn lieu of a reminiscence,  Stephen Jones, ethnographer of rural Chinese ritual and music, invites you to visit his blog: https://stephenjones.blog ("Daoism—lives—language—performance. And jokes") with rich material on ethnographic fieldwork, his lifelong experience as orchestral violinist, Stella Gibbons, Bach, Amy Winehouse,  the GDR, and so on.

My most recent China job was Chief Representative of John Swire and Sons in China. Also that previously I had postings to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Germany with Cathay Pacific Airways. Swire has been a fantastic company to work for. They have a strong emphasis on training and development, and it is guaranteed that you will have interesting and challenging assignments from day one. Speaking Chinese, it is guaranteed that you will receive postings in China in one of the many divisions.  Guy Chambers, Class of 1993Current Job: Group Managing Director, James Finley LtdI graduated in 1993 and joined John Swire & Sons to start a career in business in Greater China. Have had a variety of jobs across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - all of which beverage-related. From 1993-2012, I worked in Swire Beverages, setting up Coca-Cola JVs in China, followed by building bottling plants then setting up distribution networks to cover the country. Since 2012, I have been selling tea globally, including in China (!), in a Swire-owned business called Finlays (founded in 1750). There has not been a day that I have regretted studying Chinese. I continue to build my knowledge of Chinese history and treat Mandarin as a valuable second language. Clare Wijeratne, Class of 2000Current job: Global policy analyst, BHP BillitonMy career has taken a few twists and turns since graduating from Cambridge, but at each step, the fact that I hold a degree in Chinese studies has been a positive factor in helping me win the position I have been seeking.Immediately after graduating I went into strategy consulting with Bain & Company. This provided an invaluable grounding in many basic business skills. But spreadsheets weren’t for me and so after two years I moved to join the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as a diplomat. I was quickly posted overseas to Hong Kong for three years, then spent three years in London before another posting overseas, this time to New Delhi. In each of these roles, and understanding of China and its aspirations and role in the world was important. At the end of my time in Delhi, my husband and I were keen to remain in Asia, so we relocated to Singapore where I joined a niche consulting firm in the business intelligence sector. From there, in early 2017, I moved to BHP Billiton, the Anglo-Australian mining company, still based in Singapore. I am global policy analyst, helping the company to track and understand government policy decision making, and the impact that it can have on our business and on demand for our commodities. China remains the largest market for most of our commodities, and so understanding government policy on everything from energy use to electric cars to urbanisation to population management is really vital. And even though I’m not speaking Chinese regularly, in one way or another, I use the skills I developed at Cambridge every day. Greg McMillan, Class of 2016Current job: Astrup Fearnley AS - Shipbroker (the testimony below was written when Greg was with the Hut Group, an e-commerce company)The highlight of my time at Cambridge was the second half of my degree - studying abroad at Peking University and doing Part II back at Cambridge. After two hard years of learning characters and getting the basics, I learnt how to put the language into practice and became more comfortable applying it to academic and professional pursuits. As our language improved, we had the freedom to pursue our interests, in my case modern history and politics. In my final year, with the assistance of faculty staff, I was able to publish two papers.After graduation I started work at a large e-commerce company in Manchester. I manage business development and manage a small team responsible for trading strategy. We improve the channels through which we sell cross border, and I help the company grow and understand  the opportunities and challenges in this diverse, complex market. I represent the company in China, leading negotiations with Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu and project-managing infrastructure development (i.e. customer service centres and warehousing).You leave AMES a generalist with an understanding of a region. This has its advantages, but also its challenges. I work as a bridge between two groups of specialists, but had to make mistakes and learn very fast to add value to this process, and now am trusted to solve the problems that that arise between these groups of people. Since you add genuine value and understanding, people seek you out to help them ‘do China’ in all kinds of industries. Studying at Cambridge puts you at an advantage against many others in this position. Firstly, because the AMES course gives you a thorough linguistic and cultural grounding, which joint degrees at other universities simply cannot. Secondly, because your final two years teach you to think, which is at the requirement at the core of managing the complex, multi-party, trans-cultural, fast-paced problems you encounter in commerce. © 2017 University of Cambridge

Lectures and seminars are combined with personalized supervisions to cater for a form of education that empowers each of you as active learners while giving caring support and thoughtful guidance.  First year (Part IA): Gaining solid grounding The first year focusses mainly on language learning, as almost 75 percent of your time will be devoted to the study of Japanese in all its components: reading, writing, listening and speaking. By the end of the second term (around mid-March) of the first year, you will have covered all the basic grammar and mastered around 650 kanji (Chinese logographic characters). This means that you will have already acquired the skills that enable you to read real-world texts (paper ‘J.3: modern Japanese Texts’) during the third term of the same year. While developing a solid grounding in the language, you will study Japanese history and culture as part of the wider East Asian region (paper ‘EAS1’). This paper fosters the development of analytical and interpretative skills when engaging with East Asian primary and secondary sources. While introducing student to major themes in East Asia, the paper also encourages familiarity with theoretical approaches in different disciplines in the study of East Asia. Second year (Part IB): Going deeper and broaderThe second year continues to offer extensive teaching in the language. Language classes are designed specifically to prepare you for living and studying in Japan in the third year as well as for the more advanced study in the fourth year. You will learn new grammar while reading and translating excerpts from a wide range of real-world texts (e.g., newspapers articles, literary texts, non-fictional essays, etc.). You will also have a chance to discuss and write about them. This will take you through intermediate to early-advanced Japanese. Our BA also offers the opportunity for you to develop a more mature understanding of the Japanese language via the study of pre-modern Japanese. We do so having devised an innovative syllabus, which aims to teach classical grammar in a rigorous manner while reading intriguing texts (both canonical and non-canonical) produced from the early-modern era back in time to the Heian period. Meanwhile you are exposed to the variety of disciplines that our course offers: Japanese history, literature, society, and politics. You can also choose cultural papers from Chinese Studies as well as a cross-departmental paper in East Asian Film Studies. It is in the second year that you also begin brainstorming around the area and the topic you wish to research for your undergraduate dissertation. Of course, you are not left alone in this challenging and equally rewarding task. Our teaching staff helps you identifying a possible supervisor who will guide you in the first steps of this exciting intellectual endeavour. Third year: the Year AbroadThis is year when the knowledge and skills developed in the first two years come alive with you studying and living in Japan. To understand more about this year, please read the dedicated page on our Year Abroad. Fourth year (Part II): Generating knowledgeYou are back from the enriching Year Abroad. Your Japanese is so advanced that you can now read and discuss a variety of sources in Japanese. Japanese language is still taught with the aim to prepare you with the language skills necessary in a professional Japanese-speaking environment (be it in business, diplomacy, research or other fields).  You will be learning to make oral presentations and to write texts using the appropriate linguistic register. You will also learn to discuss a wide range of topics in Japanese and to translate advanced literary and academic texts from Japanese into English. While At the same time you can choose from a range of elective papers that allow you a deeper understanding of the disciplines you are interested in. And this is also the year during which you produce yourself new knowledge about Japan. Your dissertation, for which you would have done extensive work during your Year Abroad, now comes together in a highly original piece of writing that opens new horizons in the field of Japanese Studies. You can find examples of undergraduate dissertations in the field of Japanese society in: Brigitte Steger and Angelika Koch (eds.). Manga Girl Seeks Herbivore Boy. Studying Japanese Gender at Cambridge. Zurich: Lit, 2013. Of course you can write about a variety of different topics in other fields, relating both to pre-modern and modern eras. © 2017 University of Cambridge

You cannot study the two languages concurrently. If you take this option, you will not have a year abroad. Instead, you will be resident in Cambridge in your third year, studying basic Chinese.You are advised to put only one language as the subject on your application form, irrespective of whether you plan to do the combination in your third and fourth years at Cambridge. As you might expect, mastering two demanding Asian languages is no small achievement and we generally recommend this option only for students with particularly strong linguistic aptitude or those who may have had extensive prior exposure to one of the two languages before arriving at Cambridge.Japanese cannot be combined with languages from the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages.Japanese Studies students who are interested in the Korean language can take a paper in Korean in their fourth year.© 2017 University of Cambridge

My story starts with enrolling in Japanese studies in 2012 (St John's College); an experience that spawned a passion to begin exploring East Asian politics and foreign relations. Today I’m studying for a master’s degree in international relations at Sciences Po, Paris. Looking back at my time in Cambridge, I feel that the things I learnt there had positive outcomes that I am only starting to grasp now. Sure, I knew at the time that I would graduate with specialized knowledge of Japan and proficiency in Japanese. However, I would never have been able to tell you how the intellectual stimulation of the degree would help me later on. For example, the experience of having discussed complex issues concerning East Asia, while specialised, has proven to be a great asset in my daily policy-related studies.Coming from the unique experience that Cambridge is, switching to a different education system was a challenge in the beginning. However, once I wrapped my head around the new system life began to settle in. I like to think that while Cambridge taught me to think, Sciences Po teaches me to apply that thinking. Thus far, I have completed work on policy briefs, participated in negotiation simulations, and learnt a variety of hands-on skills relevant to diplomacy. The great thing about Sciences Po’s PSIA school is also the sheer quantity of interesting topics taught by top-level professionals in the field. It’s definitely exciting to be able to balance the academic style of Cambridge with the more professional style of Sciences Po. I believe this combination will help me achieve my ambition of working with political/business matters concerning both Japan and Europe.I have touched upon the teaching style of Cambridge, but the impact of my time there goes beyond that. I believe the environment itself, in addition to the very personal and family-like atmosphere of the university and the AMES faculty helps nurture confidence and a sense of belonging. I think this applies particularly to the Japanese department, where we were all very much in the same boat throughout our degree. Furthermore, when one pursues classes that range from classical languages to politics, it is sometimes difficult to make sense of it all, but ultimately, I believe it renders you capable to interpret and analyse any situation that you might face in the future.So to conclude, I really only have good things to say about the AMES degree. I think if you have a passion for Japan and East Asian matters this is the degree for you. At the end of the day, Cambridge degrees are similar in their structure and academic focus, but if you want a degree that opens doors and where your individual ambitions are catered for, pursuing a degree in Japanese Studies is undoubtedly the right way to go about it.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Forensic accountancy does not really look like the obvious choice for a graduate of Japanese Studies. Why did you choose this career? How difficult was it for you to find a job that interested you after graduation?Ed: While forensic accountancy doesn’t seem to be an obvious choice for a Japanese Studies graduate, I’m not sure what the “obvious choice” would be apart from translation work or further study. I struggled to get a job immediately after graduation, partly due to a personal lack of direction and desire for any particular career and partly due to a lack of work experience (I was very lazy in my holidays!)Fortunately, everything turned out well as I decided to go on a working holiday in Japan, which gave me the opportunity to improve my Japanese further and gain work experience. The type of jobs I had (I spent four months working at a ski resort, for example) also allowed me to see a very different side of Japan than the one I saw at Doshisha University in Kyoto during my year abroad. Many of my co-workers were itinerant workers, often with various addictions, who had to move around Japan relying on low-paid seasonal jobs to get by. They were great fun to work with, though, and were a stark contrast with the largely well-off students of Doshisha, many of whom go on to white-collar jobs.My father is an accountant, so I have always been aware of accountancy as a career choice. I also became interested in corruption during the course of my dissertation research (Rural Revitalization in Japan), through which I learned about the Japanese construction industry. This industry is frequently used to prop up rural economies by means of ‘white-elephant’ construction projects that negatively impact the landscape and involve a fair amount of corruption. Consequently, when I returned to England and started looking for jobs, I saw a forensic accountancy opening and thought, “Why not?” Fortunately, I was able to tie it up fairly quickly. A working holiday filled with random jobs is a handy thing in interviews!BS: Could you tell us more about what you do now? Have you had any exciting cases/discoveries?Ed: Unfortunately, fraud work has been fairly thin on the ground and I spend more time in the rather more mundane world of audit. However, the forensic projects I have worked on have been very interesting, although unfortunately I can’t go into detail about what I’ve been doing on them. While the technical work on forensic projects is often nothing special, the context of the case makes it interesting and you get the feeling that you are doing something concrete to make the world a better, less corrupt place.BS: I assume that not many forensic accountants come to their job via a degree in Japanese Studies. Could you let us know how your studies at Cambridge have been helpful in your current career?Ed: I think that the greatest asset I received from my time at Cambridge and my year abroad in Japan was an international mindset and an increased cultural awareness and acceptance of other people as a result of studying and living with people from all over the world. This has been useful in my workplace, as even in my graduate intake there were people from all over the world, including some countries which have marked cultural differences with the UK. I think that my international experience has allowed me to get along better with these people, while others have clashed with them as a result of these differences.Research skills gained while working on my dissertation have also come in handy on forensic projects (I’m currently doing a lot of research into the business environment of an African country). I think that studying a humanities subject also gives you a certain mindset that can come in useful in careers like accountancy where most people have studied a more technical subject. I never thought I’d say this, but there are times when you can tell who’s done humanities and who hasn’t!BS: What are your best memories of Cambridge and of Japanese Studies?Ed: My best memory of Cambridge and Japanese studies isn’t really of Cambridge at all – it’s of course the year abroad in Kyoto, and perhaps more specifically cycling around the city on my bike. I don’t really have the words to describe how fantastic it was to have the opportunity to spend a year studying in one of the best cities in the world. I met a lot of people from all around the world, got super-tanned working on a farm at the weekends (for fun!), and of course did a lot of touristy stuff. I even managed to learn some Japanese!If I had to pick something I miss about Cambridge, I would say the libraries. They are a fantastic resource, not just for essays but also for exploring whatever random interests you may have. You don’t really appreciate how good they are – and how great it is to be able to just wander in, pick up a random book and read for hours – until you’ve left. Oddly enough, I also have fond memories of my dissertation. The process of researching and writing was painful, but once it was done, I felt pretty proud of having produced a piece of original research in an area in which I was interested, and I still do research around my dissertation topic when things are slow at work.BS: I am pleased to hear that. I remember that you seemed to enjoy your language classes much more than your research for your dissertation!Is there anything you would like to tell young people who are thinking of applying to enroll in Japanese Studies at Cambridge?Ed: I would say go for it! Fortunately, the UK isn’t the kind of country where what you study at university necessarily becomes your career, so there is no real need to worry about studying a more niche subject and ending up with limited career options. The year of study abroad is also a concern for some people, but don’t worry about it. You’ll have the time of your life, and if you’ve survived two years of Japanese at Cambridge, Doshisha won’t pose too much of an academic threat.Interview: Dr Brigitte Steger, April 2016© 2017 University of Cambridge

We work mostly with large banks and corporates and practise a range of law, from finance to litigation. I am due to complete my training period in March 2018, at which time I will choose a department to join as an associate. Corporate law may not seem the natural place to end up having done an undergraduate degree in Japanese, but I had a long-standing and parallel interest in law, crime and sociology throughout my secondary and tertiary education. My particular interest was in crime and legal sociology in the Japanese context – what factors explained Japan's comparatively low crime rates amongst developed nations; what informed the particular ways in which crime was expressed in Japan; and how Japanese law interacted with social and cultural norms to shape the ways in which deviance was performed and regulated. While on my year abroad at Waseda University I wrote a comparative essay on youth crime in the UK and Japan, and in the final year of my degree course I performed a speech about so-called "toorima" incidents at the UK Japanese Speech Contest for University Students.After graduating, I looked at studying in Japan but was unable to locate any criminology courses. I therefore turned my attention stateside, with a long-term ambition of getting a general criminological education there before returning to Japan to continue my studies at a more advanced level. I was accepted onto the PhD Criminology and Criminal Justice programme at the University of Maryland but ended up leaving after two years once I completed my M.A., as I had realized that I did not want to continue in academia indefinitely, and that my studies there did not realistically afford me the contact with Japanese language and culture that I found myself missing.When I decided to leave academic life, I applied to a range of jobs – all were based in London, but all had to meet a single criterion: that they offered the chance to work in Japan. Law firms were attractive since many had Tokyo offices to which it was relatively easy to be seconded either temporarily or permanently, and this also meshed well with my interest in law. In particular, Clifford Chance stood out as a firm which actively encouraged its employees to travel abroad, and which seemed especially to value language and cultural skills in its global workforce. As part of my training period at Clifford Chance, I will be going out to work in the Tokyo office from March to September 2017, with the potential for longer secondments further down the line should I wish to return.What I think was particularly helpful about the education I received at Cambridge is that it not only gave me the opportunity to study the Japanese language (which I was happy to do in my own time, to be honest!) but it nurtured and encouraged my interest in other aspects of Japan. I had the opportunity in studying Japanese sociology to explore my interests in crime and law, which have been so influential in shaping my career to date. Separately, it never fails to make Japanese people laugh with surprise when I recite the opening paragraph of the Houjouki!More broadly, my years at Cambridge were an unparalleled opportunity to explore new interests and try my hand at various projects without the time constraints or pressure to achieve which increasingly dominate life in higher education and the workplace. While at Cambridge I was involved to a greater or lesser degree in theatre, magazine and newspaper editing, article writing, acting on a society board, and more. In particular, the collegiate system at Cambridge allows for myriad societies and groups, with plenty of roles for everyone to take on. It is an excellent way to build confidence and find and develop new interests, which may be peripheral or unconnected to your studies but which may yet open up new avenues for your academic and career development going forward.The key thing I have learnt is not to get too fixated on one career, one job, one course or one scholarship. It may seem that there is only the one opportunity for you to get what you want (or to go where you want) but reality is rarely that simple. If something does not work out, then there are likely a whole host of other ways of getting to the same place, even if some of those may take a bit longer, or be a little less direct. I would never have thought, when I was at university, that my current job would allow me the opportunity to use my Japanese or live in Japan, but it is one of many careers which allow for relocation to and/or contact with Japan. Do not assume that the only way you can go out to Japan or use your Japanese degree is to remain a student, or do a government scheme, or become a translator! Be conscious of how attractive language skills and, perhaps even more, understanding of another culture can make you in this increasingly globalised world. Many of my fellow trainee lawyers also completed language degrees as undergraduates, and we have easily kept up with those who studied law at interviews, during legal training and in day-to-day work. Many professions are open to linguists, and studying a language as interesting, unusual and impressive as Japanese will, if anything, make your application stand out amongst the pack.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to talk to us about your career during your visit to Cambridge. Could you tell us how you got into investment banking?  My main interests have always been in language and literature. In 1989, I was accepted to read French and German at Trinity Hall, but I decided to spend a gap year in China first. There, I was introduced to Japanese literature through the books of Mishima Yukio and Endo Shusaku. So, when I returned to Cambridge in 1991, I talked to Prof Richard Bowring and was accepted to read Japanese Studies. This was just after the bubble economy had burst, but there were still some twenty students in my year, some of whom subsequently transferred to different subjects. A total of eight of us graduated from the course.In February 1993, I participated in a Japanese speech contest and won the Sir Peter Parker Award for Spoken Business Japanese. In the audience, there was a representative from Toyota who offered me an internship at Toyota in summer 1993 and again in 1994. I actually wrote my dissertation on the auto parts industry, but at Toyota I worked in the Public Affairs division, and it was there that I first came into contact with investment banking, albeit from the research side.During my student days, the study-abroad period was only three months, so we spent Michaelmas term in Kanazawa. When I returned to Cambridge, my friends – who mostly did three-year degrees – were about to graduate and had been applying for jobs. Therefore, I was able to observe how many of them went into investment banking and consulting.I began my career at SBC Warburg in 1995 in London. Since I remained keen to live in Japan post graduation, I first did a summer internship with the company in Tokyo (before starting full time in London), and then worked for three years in London to develop a solid foundation in investment banking. In April 1998, I transferred to Tokyo. I ended up staying there for 12 years! During my time in Tokyo I changed companies. I have been working at Goldman Sachs since 2006, and moved down to Hong Kong in January 2010. All told, I have twenty-one years’ experience in investment banking. Could you tell us more about your current role? I am currently Head of the Financial Strategic Investors Group for Asia Pacific (including Japan) and Head of Investment Banking Services for Asia ex-Japan.We provide investment banking services for our clients, including (but not limited to) mergers and acquisitions, financing and associated risk management. As I have become more senior, I have assumed the responsibility of managing some of our most important client relationships on the investment banking side within Asia. What is particularly fulfilling is to have the opportunity to help our clients to pursue their strategic ambitions.I travel throughout the Asia Pacific region, almost weekly. This gives me exposure to many different cultures. I work with clients in China, Korea, Japan, India, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. I conduct most of my business in English. I am very comfortable using Japanese in a professional context, but unfortunately my spoken Chinese is limited to informal conversations. And although I do not speak Korean, I enjoy listening to the language and discovering similarities with other East Asian languages. What were the most important things you learned in Japanese Studies at Cambridge?I came into contact with Japan through literature, which I was (and remain!) very passionate about. I am convinced that if you are passionate about what you do, then you are more likely to do it very well. More broadly, however, what Cambridge nurtured in me was the ability to think and formulate opinions independently.So when I interview prospective future employees, I look for three things: a basic (but genuine) interest in the position that they are applying for, the ability to think independently, and the determination to work very, very hard.I have had to do many different things throughout my banking career, but one thing has never changed: work can be long, tiring and lonely. But for anyone who wants to be successful, be it academically or in sport, you need guts and stamina.  Do you still have time to read literature?Yes, I do. Actually, in 2000 I felt that I was selling my soul to the devil and decided to read at least one book a month! (And the nerd that I am, I have continued to record what I have read.) I still have an interest in Japanese literature and sometimes I read in Japanese, such as works by Murakami Haruki. One of the best books I read last year was ‘A Little Life’ by the Hawaiian author Yanagihara Hanya, and I was lucky to be able to attend an interview she gave at The Hong Kong Literary Festival. The situation in the world of banking and business has changed. Do you have some advice for our current students?When I was a student, the financial bubble in Japan had just burst, so my choice of Japanese was not because of the job prospects.It is not the case in all countries, but for investment banking, especially in the UK, you don’t require a background in finance. Of course, when you apply for a job, you need to read up on finance and banking in order to demonstrate your interest during the interview. The criteria for acceptance are primarily whether you can work long hours, think independently and are flexible and willing to adjust.With a degree in Japanese Studies, you don’t really have an advantage over other people in your job search (in terms of possessing the technical expertise of a computer scientist, a medic or a lawyer) unless your focus is a career that is in or related to Japan. But your experience of studying a foreign language enables you to look at things from a different perspective. This gives you flexibility and the ability to put yourself in other people’s shoes. I think that is a very useful skill indeed.Interview by Miki Kawabata and Brigitte Steger; December 2016© 2017 University of Cambridge

I started as a Japanese equity fund manager in London, but after two years was head-hunted into a role as a brokerage analyst in Tokyo at James Capel (which later became HSBC Securities). I spent a decade and a half at HSBC in Tokyo and London, eventually becoming Head of Research in Tokyo, and later Head of Global Equity Strategy at the Canary Wharf HQ.But I’d always had a hankering to become an academic, so I dropped out of banking in 2004 and returned to Cambridge to do a PhD on the economics of the Japanese tax system. Translation work helped to pay the bills, but slowed the PhD, until in 2007, another approach from a head-hunter tempted me to drop it altogether. I moved back to Tokyo as the British Council’s Director in Japan, concurrently acting as Cultural Counsellor at the British Embassy. A very happy four years there working on cultural and educational links between the UK and Japan was only slightly marred by the constant need to restructure, as the UK’s “age of austerity” reduced the Council’s government funding.In my current role as Director General of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation I do much the same sort of job at the London end of the relationship. Because of our role as one of the main funders in this sector, I am fortunate to be able to maintain close relationships with the university sector in general, and the Japanese Studies community in particular. Many academic books on Japan are launched at the Foundation, and we also have a programme of scholarships for post-graduate Japanologists.My love for Japan and its people has only increased over the years, and the excellent grounding in the language that I received at Cambridge has been an invaluable tool. My classical Japanese is rusty these days, but a little knowledge of the classics goes a long way in diplomatic circles, while the exposure the Cambridge course gave me to Japan’s history and religion has helped me understand the broader cultural context taken for granted by my many Japanese contacts and friends. The photograph shows me with my wife at a James Bond-themed party on a British warship moored in Tokyo Bay (note the helicopter in the background). Parties are, believe it or not, an essential part of my job!March 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

I came to Cambridge excited to finally learn Japanese, something I’d been interested in for many years. I was also delighted to realise just how active the university drama scene is; before arriving, I hadn’t quite appreciated the scope of opportunities to perform. From the very first term, I rehearsed and performed at the ADC Theatre alongside my academic work. I loved balancing the mental challenge of tackling Japanese from scratch with the physical challenge of long theatre rehearsals and nightly performances.I loved the pace and scope of the Japanese course at Cambridge. It is a challenging programme, but learning the basics of the language so quickly was incredibly rewarding. I was also very pleased to discover the variety of historical / cultural / linguistic modules available to us. Although I had not seriously studied Japanese before applying, a few others in my class had quite significant knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. By the end of the second term, however, we were approaching a similar level. The first two years' language classes revolve heavily around textbook learning, with perhaps fewer opportunities for conversation than at other universities, but I do not think this is a disadvantage. In fact, I was all the more motivated to make Japanese friends in Kyoto and put the extensive grammar and vocabulary I'd studied at home into practice. I was amazed at how much I had actually learned in such a short time; it was incredibly fulfilling to spend whole days and weeks speaking only in Japanese, when two years previously I barely knew a word. Thanks to the fast pace of the first two years' training, students from Cambridge seem to be able to throw themselves into busy and exciting social lives in Japan in a way that students from other courses may not have the confidence to do. I definitely have the Japanese course at Cambridge to thank for some of the best friends and most memorable experiences of my life.During my year abroad, I had a few opportunities to perform. I sang in public concerts and appeared on local and national television. I also went to see several plays in Japanese. One company in particular, Chiten, inspired me to write about Shakespeare in Japan for my final dissertation. I quickly discovered that this is a well documented area of research, so I narrowed my focus down to the work of one translator / director, Fukuda Tsuneari. The majority of his writing has not been translated into English, so I relied heavily on my relatively new language skills to work through his lengthy, often rambling philosophies. These wandered from drama and Shakespeare through to the meaning of ‘modernity’ and his perceived need for an uprising in modern Japanese society. He believed that performances of Shakespeare (specifically Hamlet) could catalyse such a revolution. Needless to say, it was quite a challenge to work through his ideas and the process took over a year. I recently found out though that the dissertation won the Ivan Morris Memorial Prize, so perhaps there was some method in the madness!During my fourth year, unsure about what I wanted to do in the future, I applied to a few MA Musical Theatre programmes. I wasn’t successful on my first attempt, and decided instead to return to Japan with the WWOOF scheme, whereby volunteers live and work on rural farms across the country. This would allow me to travel more widely and really get to grips with the language. Before I left for Japan, I applied once more to the MA Musical Theatre programme at the Royal Academy of Music in London. I found out during my trip that I had been successful, and so returned to the UK after 6 months to begin studying Musical Theatre in Autumn 2015. I had the most interesting experiences as a WWOOFer though and would love to go back to Japan with the programme again, to see new places and try my hand at different jobs.During my year at the Royal Academy of Music, I didn’t have much opportunity to practise Japanese, although I was very grateful to be able to earn some money as a Japanese tutor in the holidays. I threw myself into studying music, drama and dance, and was taken on by an acting agency before graduation. This led to my first job: performing as Alice in Anthony Neilson’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland at the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh. I’ve just returned and am now auditioning for future roles. I still work on the side as a Japanese tutor, which is a great way to support life in London.Although I am now mainly working as an actress and model, I still relish opportunities to combine my interests. For the past few years I have been working as the drama coach on the Keio-Downing Summer School in Cambridge. 60 Japanese students spend the summer in Downing College, and at the beginning of their stay we work together to help them build confidence and interpersonal skills that will aid them throughout the programme. It’s an incredibly rewarding process and I look forward to joining them again this summer!If I were to give any advice to my kohai (juniors), in drama or in Japanese, I would tell them to follow their passions, however impractical or incongruent they might seem. Instead of aiming for a particular future point or career aspiration and making sacrifices that seem appropriate on the way, see where your unique interests take you and what path they naturally carve out.Many of the jobs and experiences I've had in the past few years have required a great deal of stamina, diligence, confidence and curiosity. I can say without a doubt that I first developed these strengths whilst studying Japanese at Cambridge, and whilst learning to live alone in Japan. Cambridge is where I learned to work hard, but also where I realised the true rewards and possibilities opened up by doing so.January 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

I also had not been able to see, do and experience all that Japan had to offer. While I was interested in continuing in academia, I was also keen to work beforehand, and put my skills to use. The JET Programme: Coordinator for International RelationsWhen looking through the Camcareers website, I found a job listing for the JET Program, a well-known program which sends English speakers to work in Japanese schools as Assistant Language Teachers. However, this sounded very different from teaching English. With Japanese skills as a must, this job would be based in the international and tourism departments of Japanese local governments, and would involve translation, interpreting, event planning, assisting foreign visitors, and much more. The role is known as Coordinator for International Relations, and it sounded ideal for me. I decided to apply and see if I could get a place. The JET Program is notoriously competitive, and CIRs only make up around 5% of JET participants every year. The criteria involve Japanese ability around JLPT N2 level, a good honours degree, fair knowledge and appreciation for your own country and culture, and a desire to help with internationalization while living and working in Japan. You are able to specify your preferences for location, but it is very unlikely you will actually be placed there, particularly as a CIR when there are so few positions available. Applying to the JET ProgrammeFirst applicants apply online, and then send four copies of their form and other documents to the JET Office – in the end my forms totaled around eighty sheets of paper! After this is the interview stage. For CIRs, the interview takes place almost entirely in Japanese, and includes reading comprehension. The questions are all very practical, and aim to see how you would approach the role you were given. Depending on your location and your work environment, job requirements for CIRs can be drastically different. Some people spend a lot of time on school visits and events; some barely leave the office for translation work. Some will have to interpret for prestigious political events; some might never have to interpret at all. Some will have a very strict job description, and some can create their own work and projects, to be continued by the CIRs who follow them. As far as the interview questions and my experience go, although it is very important to have a concrete idea of what you want to bring to the role, JET looks for versatility and enthusiasm most of all from its participants. My work in the Yamanashi Prefectural OfficeIn the end, I was accepted onto the JET Programme as a CIR, and placed in the Global Exchange and Tourism Department of the Yamanashi Prefectural Office, in the capital city of Kofu. When I told my Japanese friend, she laughed and told me it was so rural most people haven’t even heard of it. Kofu City is definitely a quieter city than most. It is located in a basin, surrounded by mountains almost 3,000 ft high, often rising over above the clouds. And on a good day, in the distance, Mt Fuji rises above them all. My work mostly involves translation work: emails and letters, pages of the website, promotional information for the prefecture. People from across the Prefectural Office will bring work for translation, and the variation keeps things interesting. There are also quite a few interpreting jobs, for when visitors from outside Japan come on business or official trips. My first interpreting job took place over three days, for employees of a food company in Singapore, who visited many small businesses and farms across the prefecture. Not only was it a fun challenge, I was also able to try many of the products and see the sights of Yamanashi along with the visitors. I also help update the blog and go on school visits, telling students all about the UK. The charm of Yamanashi PrefectureOn the weekends, there is plenty to see and do – and working in the tourism office, I quickly learnt about what Yamanashi has to offer. All the mountains in the prefecture mean it is very sparsely populated, but hiking is a very popular pastime, and it doesn’t take too much climbing (or long on a train) to reach a breathtaking view. Agriculture is also a huge part of Yamanashi’s culture – it is known for its fruit production, and some of the first wineries in Japan were opened in Yamanashi. I am a big fan of local produce and living simply, but I doubt I would have been able to try this in Japan if I had been placed in a more urban location. How studying at Cambridge made all this possibleIf it wasn't for Cambridge, I'm not sure I would have been able to take on this role. I might not even have known about the CIR position - I signed up for the Careers Service, and discovered this programme while looking for positions related to Japan. However, Cambridge also prepared me in many ways I didn't even realise until I began the job. Cambridge has a strong language focus during the first year, which many students find challenging – but it secures the foundations of the language early on in your studies, building on top of them for easier understanding and consolidation in second year. I set out to Kyoto in my third year with a good grasp of the language – enough that I could navigate, but still at a level where I could take full advantage of immersion. I cannot stress the importance of the year abroad enough. If I had not lived in Japan before working as a CIR, I would have found it incredibly difficult. The year abroad doesn't just let you use and learn the language in a real setting. By living in Japan, you learn first hand about Japanese life, its culture and the people. I had so many opportunities, sitting the JLPT N2 and working several part-time jobs, which gave me both the hard qualifications for my JET application and the experience of working in Japan. And separate from the course itself, my teachers at Cambridge were all extremely helpful, supportive and considerate, particularly when it came to my application and my interview. Dr Kawabata, the Senior Language Teaching Officer in Japanese took time out of her schedule to do practice interviews with me, which was probably the best preparation I could have had. I am incredibly grateful that I was able to study on such an excellent course, with such fantastic teachers. A few last remarksFor people who want to work in Japan after graduation, and who would like a challenge, I would definitely recommend applying for JET as a CIR. The program is well regarded, and every person’s experience is unique. Opportunities to go and work in Japan as a foreigner straight out of university are few, particularly in this kind of role. The experience is very valuable, and I have learnt so much in a very short amount of time. If you are interested, definitely apply and see how it goes – and come and visit Yamanashi Prefecture if you can!© 2017 University of Cambridge

At that point, I could not have guessed that I would carry on beyond an undergraduate degree. The first year was an intense and effective introduction to modern Japanese grammar and East Asian History. At the start of second year, we had the chance to choose between several courses, and encouraged by the promise that “Classical Japanese is not boring!” I went along to the first class, and was immediately hooked. After the stately 13th century Tales of a Ten Foot Hut, we moved onto the far earthier Fake Tales of Ise—an impishly clever direct parody of the famous Tales of Ise—and I had my first taste of Edo Period literature. At first, the term “Premodern literature” might not seem like it will be a thrill a minute, but I soon found I was enthralled by each new text we covered. In our classes, I enjoyed the challenges of untangling ambiguous grammar, understanding and translating the humour of the texts, and being able to engage with “real” Premodern Japanese literature without the feeling of slogging through a textbook. It was wonderful to be told that the main goal of the course was not simply to get high marks in exams, but to experience as wide a range of genres and periods as we could. The weird and wonderful world of hentaigana and kuzushijiPart way through this year I was able to join a small reading group where we learnt how to read original woodblock printed texts from the Edo Period. It was exciting to encounter these texts “in the flesh”, and not in edited, annotated critical editions. I was apprehensive at first—would it be possible to decipher the beautiful but seemingly-incomprehensible cursive kanji (kuzushiji meaning Chinese characters that are literally “collapsed” or “crumbled”) and the bewildering squiggles of hentaigana (Alternate or “anomalous” renderings of the Japanese kana)? I needn’t have worried. Often, after scouring through dictionaries, the character would leap off the page, and there was a huge satisfaction in having solved the riddle. At times, we would all be scratching our heads, thinking, “it could be this… but maybe it’s this…maybe we can’t work this out”, and that was ok. Sometimes we have to accept that there is no clear-cut answer, and this was a surprisingly liberating revelation. In another group we had the opportunity to work with scholars from institutions across the world to read virtually unknown texts, and collaborate to produce high-quality annotated transcriptions. It was through these groups that I began to experience the trials and tribulations of research using real Edo Period texts. Anthropomorphised bottoms, and other curiositiesIn my third year, as I headed off for a year abroad in Kyoto, ideas were bubbling up for an undergraduate dissertation that could combine my budding interest in Edo Period literature with my long-held interest in translation theory. Together with my supervisor, we decided I would work on a mid-19th century illustrated hanashibon (“book of jests”) that featured personified proverbs, creating fanciful origin stories for them and punning incessantly on them. It was a great opportunity to try out my hentaigana reading and transcription skills—I was lucky enough to be given the use of a version of the precious original texts—and also made for an interesting discussion about the concept of untranslatability. Unsurprisingly, there’s no good way to translate a proverb about courtesan with a bottom for a face. It feels like no mean feat to write a thesis, but I was well-supported throughout and at the end of my final year, I had produced a thesis of which I could be proud (see fig. 1).        Fig. 1  Diving into graduate studiesAs I neared the end of the undergraduate degree, it became increasingly apparent that I might have the chance to carry onto an MPhil degree. I was warmly encouraged to apply for further studies, and felt that to leave the “forest of books” (an Edo Period metaphor that my supervisor used, which left a strong impression, and has stayed with me for a long while) at this point would be a shame. I was accepted onto the MPhil research program to produce a dissertation that would focus on translating the wit of Santō Kyōden’s (1761-18) kibyōshi (literally, “yellow-covers”, a type of popular fiction that flourished in Edo at the turn of the 19th century). It was a very valuable year—not only did I have my first ever experience of producing an extended piece of research, I also had to learn to manage my time properly (a work in progress!) without relying on the structure of a class-based taught degree. I was enabled to hone my research skills, and encouraged to gain the confidence to work with a greater degree of independence. At the end of the year I had the exhilarating and slightly intimidating experience of defending my thesis before two established academics from outside the institution, exposing me to the constructive criticism needed to produce good research. Onwards and over The PondAs I progressed through the MPhil degree, I was given a great deal of support by members of the Faculty to find the best way to continue my research and education. I was introduced to potential supervisors at various institutions in the States with whom I might build up further fruitful working relationships, and helped to navigate the ins and outs of making a successful application. I feel incredibly fortunate to have begun my academic training at Cambridge, which gave me the fundamental skills necessary for the PhD programme in Japanese Literature that I have now joined at Columbia University in New York. Without the dedicated support of members of the Faculty I would never have looked beyond a first degree, let alone towards a career in academia.31 October 2016 © 2017 University of Cambridge

Japan was still so far away (a week on the trans-Siberian), there was no access to contemporary material, and no way of copying anything. There were zero students ahead of us and zero behind, so we felt like lonely pioneers. Still, I count myself fortunate in my wild choice (for it was considered close to madness at the time), because the study of the language and culture has absorbed my energies for a lifetime.After graduation, I tried airline management with Cathay Pacific for two years and quickly realised that I was not cut out for business. Back to Cambridge for a three-year PhD on Mori Ōgai (I was the only graduate student), and Tokyo University (another lonely place!) followed by my first academic job at Monash University in Melbourne, another world altogether where Japanese was already being taught to large classes at Junior School level. From there I went to Columbia, then Princeton, and then finally back to Cambridge in 1985, where there was a big job to do, putting the subject back on its feet after a series of savage cuts. Believe it or not, there was serious talk of closing Japanese Studies down completely in the mid 1980s.Not many students want to go into academia these days. I am not sure why, but I hope it is not that we have been bad role models. It is not for everyone, of course, but I would still recommend it for the few who are brave enough, or perhaps foolhardy enough, to trust that a job might possibly be forthcoming after years struggling through all that barbed wire, as someone once said to me, trying to describe what Japanese looked like to the uninitiated.March 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

During a 10-year career break from the financial industry I trained as a chef, ran a small catering business for 8 years, wrote a cook book and kept up my passion for Japan through consulting work giving seminars on Japanese culture in the business world.Since May 2015 I have been working at SMBC Nikko Capital Markets, London in the Corporate Access department and was recently made head of the team. I accompany Japanese Corporate Management on Investor Relations roadshows in London and EU cities, brief them on institutional investors, attend meetings, provide feedback to the Equity Sales Team. I manage a team of 6 people who arrange IR roadshows and pitch mandate advice to our Tokyo counterparts.I was definitely not top of the class in my studies at the Faculty but found the course provided a very good grounding in spoken and written Japanese as well as in depth study of specific aspects of Japan. My main ambition after graduating was to get to Japan as soon as possible to further develop the skills that my degree had given me. The financial industry provided excellent opportunities for me to use these skills, to develop others as well and resulted in a very fulfilling career so far. Even during my career break when I took up cooking in earnest, Japanese cuisine dominated my menus!My main observation would be that there is still a solid need for speakers of Japanese in the financial industry today but sadly relatively few graduates. As the Japanese economy has been lacklustre during Japan's "lost decades," there has been limited recruitment of new blood, especially at non-Japanese firms, leaving something of a vacuum in terms of new young talent to replace the old guard who are now approaching retirement. With that in mind I would highly recommend pursuing a degree in Japanese Studies.January, 2017© 2017 University of Cambridge

Congratulations, Sven! Could you tell me about your new job? What does it entail?I am currently the international strategy director at the Japanese arm of the global advertising agency MullenLowe. What that actually means is that I oversee all the projects in Tokyo that involve bridging culture between Japan and the rest of the world. This can mean helping to find the right angle on how to talk about beauty in Japan for a foreign shampoo brand or helping a Japanese manufacturer find the right way to tell its story abroad. While the world is becoming more and more globally uniform, there is still considerable power in brands communicating not just in a foreign language but through local culture. It is only in that way that a brand can tug at the heartstrings of its consumers. You only graduated in 2010, and I remember that you had plans to do a Master’s degree in Japan. So, your career has progressed rapidly, even though it was not perhaps what you had initially planned. Could you tell us about it? I came to Japan shortly after the earthquake that shook Tohoku in 2011 to study for a Master’s degree at Tokyo University. Due to the immense cost of the disaster, scholarships were suddenly cut and I was no longer able to simply rely on the scholarship to keep afloat. Through the Cambridge Careers Website, I saw an opening at a research and strategy consultancy in Tokyo and applied immediately. I was offered a job a week later and kept pursuing my Master’s degree at the same time as working as a cultural researcher.The company was going through a rough time as the world economy was focusing on the opportunities presented by growth in China. China seemed like a better place to put your bets on. It had just become the second largest economy – overtaking Japan – while Japan was grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake, rising national debt, shrinking population and a high yen. It just didn’t make sense for multinationals to spend their research budgets on Japan. The boutique consultancy was not doing well and within a year of joining the team shrank to just three employees.I needed to choose to concentrate on either my degree or my job. I wasn’t really enjoying the experience of being at Tokyo University, and I was certain that my career path was going to lie in business. What I loved about my academic years was learning and coming up with theories of why social systems work the way they do, and working for a cultural research agency allowed me to do just that.I decided to drop out of Tokyo University just six months before graduating to commit to my career. Difficult choices have a tendency to pay off and so, as the business picked up, I was able to grow with the company. In just three years I was an associate director leading large-scale research projects that led to some very successful results for my clients.Through a mix of luck and making the right decisions along the way, I helped MullenLowe win a large account, which allowed me to move to them into a senior position.But that is not to say that I have turned my back on academia, as it remains the only true space where you can deepen your understanding of a given subject without the distractions of business needs. As such, I am now also an adjunct professor at Keio University, teaching branding and market entry strategy to undergraduates, which allows me to marry practice with theory. Apart from language and knowledge about Japan, could you tell us what else you learned at Cambridge that was useful for your career?I found my time at Cambridge immensely valuable in so many different ways. Sure, learning the language helps but it was more than anything the opportunity to spend time with immensely intelligent people (from teaching faculty right through to fellow students) that helped shape the way I see Japan and find my personal view on how things work.Studying at Cambridge is hard. You are inundated with more work than you have experienced before. It sometimes feels like your back will break under the load but believe me, that is a good thing. It teaches you how to prioritise, juggle, how to focus and how to structure. These skills are essential for anything you want to do in life and no ‘how to’ book can teach you.But even beyond the classroom, Cambridge is a surprisingly good model of the real world. It’s a student ecosystem that echoes everything you experience in life afterwards, but in a more bitesize fashion. This can be the politics of the Cambridge Union, the journalism and business of the newspapers, the friendships, and also the animosities. It’s simply training for how to conduct your life thereafter. Throw yourself into it and see what comes of it. Is there anything you would like to tell young people who are thinking of applying to enrol in Japanese Studies at Cambridge? Any advice you want to give to your kōhai?Japanese Studies is not for the faint-hearted. You are doing a complete degree with an immensely challenging language on top. This means you have to commit wholeheartedly to the challenge ahead. Read around the subject. The faculty can provide excellent recommendations for what books to read (through it I discovered the incredible author Tanizaki Junichiro and also Mishima Yukio!). Learning Japanese before enrolling can give you an upper hand as a lot of the first year is spent on language acquisition. Certainly, getting the basics of the syllabic writing system out of the way before arriving helps!A degree in Japanese Studies doesn’t have to end up with a career in Japan. Actually, many of my fellow students did not make Japan their home. As the degree is wonderfully broad (Literature, Politics, History, Sociology etc.), the degree allows you to discover yourself over the span of the four years.Being one of the smallest degree programmes in the university, you will grow very close to your lecturers and fellow students. You are part of a family of people driven by passion. I have found that to be a real strength of Japanese Studies. You can easily approach your lecturers when you have questions, and amongst the students there is a sense of camaraderie that you don’t see as much in other subjects.Japan remains one of the most fascinating cultures. It is full of quirks and oddities and never ceases to amuse and amaze. With a history that is intricate and rich, and a unique art and design history that has produced some of the greatest works humanity has created, learning about Japan is simply an enriching experience.Questions asked by Brigitte Steger, November 2016© 2017 University of Cambridge

Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge offers students the opportunity to study some of the most complex and interesting political issues of our times, whilst also giving them access to some of the most beautiful poetry in history, conveyed through some of the richest language systems in the world.The BA in Middle Eastern Studies (MES) is distinctive for the range of language and subject combinations you can choose. Our aim is to provide you with extensive language abilities in one or more language spoken in the Middle East, to teach you the methods and styles of scholarly disciplines, and to further your understanding of the region through its history, politics, cultures, philosophies, and literatures. The skills you will obtain whilst studying for the BA open up a wide range of career options and the knowledge and experiences you acquire open up your mind.Many students choose to combine MES with learning a European language through the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages (MML). As you learn a Middle Eastern language from scratch, you can continue in a language you’re already familiar with. A combined degree in MES and MML offers access to a wide variety of paper choices, including topics in linguistics, comparative literature, and Audio Visual Media.The year abroad in your third year is where all that book learning comes to life. Living in a place, speaking the language, and conducting research in the language provides students the chance to obtain a deeper level of knowledge and appreciation for the cultures and histories of the region. The year abroad requires you to put what you’ve learned to use in a totally new environment. During at least eight months of your third year you will study, maybe work or volunteer, make new friends, and consolidate your language skills in the Middle East. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.The Department of Middle Eastern Studies holds Undergraduate Open Days in mid-March and early July each year. The Open Day provides an excellent opportunity for you and your parents to meet academic staff from the Department and to ask any questions that you might have about our courses.Further information about postgraduate courses at the Department may be found in our Graduate Studies section.© 2017 University of Cambridge

That includes Morocco, Mauritania and Western Sahara in the West, and stretches to Iraq, the Gulf states and Somalia in the East. It is the official language in 26 countries, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is also the sacred language of around 1.5 billion Muslims across the world, and the language in which some of the world's greatest works of literature, science, and history have been written.According to the teachings of Islam, Classical Arabic is the language in which Allah chose to speak to humankind through Prophet
An Arabic-Persian dictionary, 19th-century, Central Asia, bought in Bukhara, end of XXe century. Private collection of Christine van Ruymbeke. 
 Muhammad in the 7th century of the Christian era. It is the language of the Qur'an, Islam's holy book. This is the language of Islamic and classical texts. Modern Standard Arabic is the language of books and news broadcasts, poetry and political speeches across the whole Arab world, the language that every Arab primary school child learns to read and write in. It is the ever versatile language of the Arabic poetical tradition, the precise language of the jurists and the theologians, the dazzling rhetoric of the orators and the preachers, and the lingua franca of the internet. Knowing Arabic gives an opportunity to communicate with people throughout the Middle East, and provides access to the the richness and passion of the contemporary Arab world. Arabic is the means for exploring almost 14 centuries of one of the most sophisticated, varied, and rich intellectual heritages in the world.However, nobody speaks Standard Arabic as their native language. They learn it at school, but the mother tongue of a native Arabic speaker is the dialect of their own country—and even that of the specific region of their country. The Cambridge classroom attempts to mirror the Arab world, using Egyptian dialect to speak and Standard Arabic to read and write. Egyptian has the advantage of being a central dialect that Arabs from other parts can readily understand, and which can easily be adapted to speaking in other dialects. When students spend their year in the Middle East, they come back speaking the dialect of whichever country they have chosen to spend their time in, so that the fourth-year language classroom, like the Arab world itself, is a mix of dialects. Just as Standard Arabic gives access to the thought and literature of the Arabs, so the dialects give access to all the vitality and warmth of their everyday lives.© 2017 University of Cambridge

These have included business, diplomacy, industry, teaching, academic research, work with charities, NGOs and international organisations, public policy work, journalism, consulting and publishing, to name only a few. Others have gone on to pursue further professional qualifications in law or accountancy, for example.The Cambridge degree programme gives graduates access to many rare opportunities. Arabic studies in particular turns graduates  into highly desirable job candidates in a range of professions. Graduates with Arabic skills are often sought by governmental and private sectors. Former students have gone on to work with international banks, pursue higher degrees in the United States and the UK, conduct ethnographic field work in political hot-spots, work as a journalist with internationally renowned news agencies, and teach kids in North Africa.In addition to the world of work, many have found that acquiring a Middle Eastern language opened up a lifetime of possibilities of travel, friendship and cultural acquaintance.Career profiles of some of our recent graduates are listed below."Since graduating in 2011 with a BA in Oriental Studies, I have continued to work on the Middle East, completing an MPhil in Social Anthropology before moving to the London School of Economics to begin a PhD on Political Engagement in Lebanon. I am currently in Beirut conducting fieldwork."AMES (Hebrew and Arabic), King’s College, 2013 Graduate. "I am currently a Fulbright Masters Candidate at the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University. I can see the incredibly strong language skills I have built up over the past years in comparison to others, especially in reading and writing (though there is still much room for improvement). At Harvard I am expanding my academic research skills, which I feel were well established in Cambridge, with more qualitative research skills. At the moment I am attending a fieldwork research course with Harvard in Jordan on the Syrian Refugee Crisis. This coming summer I am likely to follow up with the projects I am now working on, either in Jordan or Lebanon." © 2017 University of Cambridge

Options for combining study of the Arabic language with a Modern Language are outlined [here]. In your second year, the following papers are offered as part of the BA in Middle Eastern Studies: Intermediate Arabic, Literary Arabic, The Formation of Islam, The Formation of the Middle East, and Contemporary Middle Eastern Politics and Society.You may combine a selection of these papers with other options from the Middle Eastern Studies Tripos offered by the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, the Department of Linguistics and the Faculty of Divinity. Options for continuing your Arabic language studies alongside papers from the Modern Languages Tripos are outlined [here]. The object of the year abroad is to greatly develop your competence in the language and your understanding of the society and culture within which it is used. It is also the time to start work on a dissertation, on a topic of your choosing within the range that the Department can supervise. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.If you are studying towards the BA in Middle Eastern Studies, you are normally required to spend eight months in a Middle Eastern country. If you are studying Arabic as a whole subject, you are required to spend eight months in an Arabic-speaking country. If you are combining Arabic with Persian or Hebrew, you are required to spend at least four months in an Arabic-speaking country and at least three months in Israel or Iran, or an equivalent deemed appropriate, unless you are from a Hebrew- or Persian-speaking background.If you are combining a Middle Eastern language with a Modern language, you are required to spend the full eight months in the Middle East. You are not required to spend any time in a country relevant to your European language.The countries our students spend the year abroad in vary, according to their inclinations and the political conditions in the Middle East. For example, in 2015 - 16 we have students in Jordan, Oman, the West Bank, Egypt, and Morocco. Students have spent their year abroad doing a wide range of things, from assisting in a school in a north Lebanese town, helping in a Palestinian theatre company, and volunteering at a hospital, to interning with an Egyptian human rights organisation, and working with a sailing company in Oman.The two-year course in Part II consists of advanced-level language teaching, plus a number of special subject options. These options reflect the research interests of the teaching staff, and will give you an opportunity to study a particular subject within Arabic Studies at a high level of detail. A dissertation of 12,000 words, usually connected with your special subject paper, is also a requirement.© 2017 University of Cambridge

I had studied Spanish at school but Arabic was a complete stab in the dark. Luckily it was a stab right on target, and by the end of first year I had decided to drop Spanish and move fully into FAMES, picking up Persian alongside Arabic. Studying Arabic is a completely new type of language learning experience. At first it can appear a formidable challenge, but it is also extremely refreshing. Arabic is a Semitic language and so its linguistic basis is entirely different to that of the European languages I was taught at school.The department is small - under 20 students of Arabic per year - and the workload is large. However if you ask any student of AMES whether they are happy to be there, it is a resounding yes. The small number of students means that classes are more relaxed, more intimate, and students develop friendships that rival those inside College. The workload is treated as part of the deal. You are starting a new language and want to come away fluent so there’s going to be a lot to learn. But the goals are realistic and you are never set irrelevant work.As a second year, I am currently planning for my Year Abroad next year. Once again, it is a daunting but terribly exciting prospect. I visited Jordan last summer with my fellow Arabic students and it was an eye-opening experience. This was my first trip to the Middle East since entering Cambridge and the ability to start communicating in Arabic was fantastic. It reminded us all of the importance of the language we were learning. Alongside the language papers, I am also taking papers in Arabic Literature and Middle Eastern politics and society. In the latter paper we have been examining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from an anthropological perspective. The work has really interested me and I am considering the possibility of focusing my year abroad research on a related topic. I hope to visit the refugee camps in the West Bank and examine how the conflict is viewed from the perspective of the camps’ inhabitants. As part of my previous study of Spanish, I spent a month in Mexico teaching children from the poorer parts of Mexico City. I hope to use this experience and interest to focus my dissertation on the impact of the conflict on children in the Palestinian camps. I’m currently planning a trip to the West Bank this Easter to do further research.It is an exciting prospect. I am aware that the guidance of my professors, and my increasing competence in the Arabic language, will make it all the more fulfilling and valuable."© 2017 University of Cambridge

It gives you not only access into a new world—people, places, culture, history, and world view—but also new perspective on the world you already know. This is true of learning any new language, but the effects are arguably more profound in the case of a language like Hebrew, both a vibrantly dynamic and amazingly flexible modern language of speech and culture and an ancient tongue whose writings are rich in history, artistry, and thought. Few modern languages can boast a literary repertoire as influential as Hebrew’s has been in the course of human history. And no ancient language has enjoyed more success at being revived as a mother tongue than Hebrew. Whatever your background, however much you may know or not know about Hebrew and its literature, whatever your interests in the language and culture of Israel, and whatever you may see yourself doing with this training in future, we invite you to consider entering into the world of Hebrew—in all its wealth, depth, and vitality.Documentation of the Hebrew language extends back 3,000 years or more, from the earliest inscriptions and biblical texts, down to the most recent Israeli songs, novels, and newspaper editions. It is the main language of the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible, i.e., Old Testament), as well as of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which, since their initial discovery in 1947, have shed much light on a convulsive period in Jewish history in the late Second Commonwealth.After Biblical Hebrew a later form of the language was used by the early rabbis and sages in their voluminous writings, e.g., the Mishna, the Talmud, and midrashim (explanations of biblical texts), which are foundational to Judaism. In the Middle Ages Hebrew continued to be used by the great Jewish commentators on the Bible, and by poets, grammarians, and authors of many other works. Throughout, the language also, of course, served as a vehicle of Jewish prayer and worship, both at home and in the synagogue, and was a means of international communication between Jewish communities. Since the Renaissance and Reformation periods and up to the present day, Christians have also studied Hebrew. Finally, comatose as a widely-used mother tongue for some 1800 years, Hebrew was unprecedentedly reinvigorated as a spoken mother tongue in the nineteenth century. No longer just a liturgical and literary language, it rapidly became a vernacular in everyday use, and is now the most widely-employed language of the State of Israel, where it continues to develop, is used for all forms of communication, and where there is a vigorous and growing literature.Cambridge has long been a centre for Hebrew and Semitic studies, the Regius Professorship of Hebrew having been founded by Henry VIII in 1540. The University Library has a large number of Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, and special mention must be made of the famous Taylor-Schechter Genizah Collection. This collection contains thousands of manuscript fragments datable to the seventh century CE onwards. It attracts scholars from many parts of the world to work in Cambridge. Students wishing to learn about the Genizah enjoy guided access to the collection as well as expert supervision in their research.In three words, rigour, breadth, and flexibility. Taught in small groups by experts in the field, our students reach high levels in communicative and analytical stills. The Hebrew degree at FAMES takes four years, with the third year spent abroad. Along with general courses on Middle Eastern history and culture, students in the FAMES Hebrew programme study Hebrew language, literature, and culture of all periods (ancient, medieval, and modern). The teaching staff include specialists in each of these periods. It is our approach to integrate these historical layers of the language in a single coherent course. This gives the study of the modern language and literature a meaningful historical depth and the study of ancient Hebrew an added vitality. All students have the opportunity to study original medieval manuscripts from the Genizah. Topics covered in conjunction with the study of Modern Hebrew include the depiction of Israeli culture in the media, for example, changes in the depiction of the Haredim (ultra-orthodox) in film and television; the roots and development of Zionism; the presentation of gender in Hebrew literature; the birth and development of Modern Hebrew literature based on ancient strata and on the late pre-modern output of the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment) and the Tehiya (Revival).A student's third year in the Hebrew programme is spent in Israel. This is one of the most important components of the course, since it allows the student to be immersed in Israeli culture, to build on the linguistic knowledge acquired during the first two years in order to reach near-fluency in the language, and to conduct first-hand research on a research topic of their choice. For example, one recent student's 4th-year dissertation examined distinctive features in the Modern Hebrew speech of the Bedouins in Israel. The Hebrew Studies programme at Cambridge is, of course, excellent preparation for pursuing of more advanced degrees in Hebrew and Hebrew-related subjects (such as Bible, Religious Studies, Theology, Hebrew literature, history, and Middle Eastern Studies, and other Semitic languages, Arabic included), but as the language of a modern and thriving democracy of the Near East, it is also immensely useful as preparation for jobs in foreign relations, diplomacy, conflict resolution, development, translation, and journalism, as well as for work in non-profit and non-governmental organizations, experience which employers in all fields find attractive in prospective employees. Relative to the graduates of other universities and of other departments within the University of Cambridge, FAMES graduates consistently rank high in finding suitable employment in a variety of fields and/or being accepted into advanced degree courses after graduation.click on the links below for descriptions of the various combination and concentration tracks availableFull Hebrew PathHebrew and Arabic Language CombinationHebrew and Modern European Language CombinationHebrew and Persian Language EmphasisHebrew and Ancient Near Eastern Language EmphasisHebrew and Linguistics EmphasisHebrew and Jewish Studies EmphasisHebrew and Middle Eastern Studies EmphasisHebrew and Semitics Emphasis© 2017 University of Cambridge

Those leaving the university after their first degree have pursued careers in the private and public sector, including business, banking, the media, diplomacy and government. Some students have gone on to postgraduate studies and undertaken academic careers, becoming the next generation of scholars. Some students come to study Hebrew to explore their Jewish heritage, and end up working in the Jewish community as teachers or religious leaders. A Cambridge degree with a Hebrew concentration opens doors to people and experiences in Israel and beyond. Hebrew language teaching is a vibrant field, especially outside of Israel. Students of Hebrew find careers in academia and language pedagogy, as well as in the United Nations. Community organizations, such as interfaith groups, are always seeking members with Hebrew fluency. Learning Hebrew alongside another Middle Eastern language makes students ideal candidates for higher levels of research in politics, anthropology, and the history of the modern Middle East.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Options for combining study of the Hebrew language with a Modern Language are outlined [here].In your second year, the following papers are offered as part of the BA in Middle Eastern Studies: Intermediate Hebrew, Hebrew Literature, Topics in Hebrew Studies, The Formation of the Middle East and Contemporary Middle Eastern Politics and Society.You may combine a selection of these papers with other options from the Middle Eastern Studies Tripos offered by the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, the Department of Linguistics and the Faculty of Divinity. Options for continuing your Hebrew language studies alongside papers from the Modern Languages Tripos are outlined [here]. The object of the year abroad is to greatly develop your competence in the language and your understanding of the society and culture within which it is used. It is also the time to start work on a dissertation, on a topic of your choosing within the range that the Department can supervise. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.If you are studying Hebrew as a whole subject, you are required to spend eight months in Israel. If you combine Hebrew with Arabic or Persian, you are required to spend at least four months in an Arabic-speaking country and at least three months in Israel or Iran (or an equivalent deemed appropriate, and unless you are from a Hebrew- or Persian-speaking background). Most students spend the year at a major university in Israel in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa or Beer-Sheva. All of these universities have special programmes for overseas students. Such programmes offer intensive language study with courses in subjects such as Israeli history, society, modern literature, Jewish thought, politics or Biblical studies. Some students do voluntary work instead, for some or all of the year.If you are combining a Middle Eastern language with a Modern language, you are normally required to spend the full eight months in the Middle East. You are not required to spend any time in a country relevant to your European language.The two-year course in Part II consists of advanced-level language teaching, plus a number of special subject options. These options reflect the research interests of the teaching staff, and will give you an opportunity to study a particular subject within Hebrew Studies at a high level of detail. A dissertation of 12,000 words, usually connected with your special subject paper, is also a requirement.© 2017 University of Cambridge

In the first year, this involved the intensive study of both the Biblical and the Modern language as well as courses which contextualised this within the wider cultural, historical and anthropological background of the Middle East. One thing that I am always grateful for at the Faculty is the flexibility that is shown, coupled - thanks to the excellent staff-student ratio - with high levels of investment and support for the individual interests and talents of the student. Within Hebrew studies, it is possible - even encouraged - to explore a wide range of complementary fields, which help to add depth to the core language and cultural courses taught within the Hebrew department. This can both take the form of inner-departmental courses on broader Middle Eastern topics, and external papers borrowed from other faculties.I also enjoyed the strong focus on literature during my time at AMES, which for me offers an inspiring lens through which to look at the social, political and historical elements that shaped the contours of Israeli society, as well as providing a more tangible grasp on the language in all its historical and formal depth.        My year abroad was spent in Jerusalem, an exciting, terrifying, and in many ways life-changing experience. I divided the year between studying at the Hebrew University and working for a charity, an organisation dedicated to teaching mentally-handicapped adults simple skills and providing a supportive environment in which they could work and realise their independence. The half-Hebrew, half-Arabic speaking workplace was often a challenge, but ultimately I found it a rewarding experience working with these incredibly generous and kind-hearted people.Now returning for my fourth year, I am looking towards pursuing my interest in linguistics through postgraduate study.  In the meantime, however, I’m taking courses in Hebrew literature, Zionism and Culture, and Comparative Semitic Linguistics, as well as writing a dissertation on the creation of the Hebrew folk song.”© 2017 University of Cambridge

The main languages offered are Arabic, Persian, Hindi and Hebrew, with papers on Akkadian and Egyptian offered through the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology. In recent years  students with a BA in Middle Eastern Studies have gone on to become lawyers, to work in the financial sector, in local government, publishing and in NGOs, among other areas.© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, there are two key differences that you should be aware of. At Cambridge, the application process starts earlier to allow time for interviews to be organized. You will also be asked to specify a College as well as naming your chosen degree subject in the application.In your College you will have a Director of Studies who will be responsible for your academic welfare and for your progress. In the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies supervisions are arranged by your teachers in the Faculty.
Dr. Yaron Peleg
Students studying Middle Eastern Studies and wondering which College to apply to should be aware that members of academic staff teaching about the Middle East are Fellows of the following Colleges. In some cases they also act as Director of Studies for all students in Middle Eastern Studies. In other Colleges your Director of Studies is likely to be a specialist in Asian Studies.In addition to talking to you about your personal statement, interviewers will want to know why you want to study the language on which you will be spending the next four years of your life (at least). Before your interview you should do some exploratory reading about the Middle East and be prepared to talk about your reading in the interview. This can include general histories, literature in translation, and other reading that relates to your main interest in the region. Wikipedia (which is not a trustworthy scholarly source) and other internet sources alone are not good enough!© 2017 University of Cambridge

At the moment I am attending a fieldwork research course with Harvard in Jordan on the Syrian Refugee Crisis."Elsien van Pinxteren,  AMES (Hebrew and Arabic), King’s College, 2013 Graduate."I started at Clare in 2007, studying for the Middle East and Islamic studies with Arabic BA. I'd come to Cambridge with very little experience in the language and history of the region, but with lots of questions about them that I wanted to find answers to. Studying in a small faculty like the Asian and Middle Eastern Studies faculty was perfect for that. All my lectures had such small numbers of people in them that it felt much more like a classroom, where open discussion dominated. I don't think friends in bigger faculties felt the same way. I also enjoyed the flexibility of the course, taking a few papers from elsewhere in the university, including the Theology faculty, which helped expose me to other disciplines and ways of approaching questions. Although there was enough work to mean that you never had an ‘empty plate’, I found plenty of time to get involved in other activities like sports. Since leaving Cambridge, I've joined the Foreign Office where I've continued to develop my Arabic. I've also gone on to do a Graduate Diploma in Economics in evening study at Birkbeck College, and am now doing an MSc in Economic policy at SOAS by correspondence, in which I’m combining my new economic studies with the regional and language expertise I gained during my BA.""I chose to study Arabic when I was 15 due to my opposition to and interest in the Iraq War. Exactly ten years later, I was rewarded for my hard work by being given the opportunity to work directly with Iraqis seeking asylum through the International Organization for Migration (IOM)'s resettlement programme. The job involved conducting interviews with three Iraqi families per day and recording both their biographical data as well as their persecution stories, all of this in Arabic and without interpreters.  I would never have been able to do this without the solid base in both Arabic and the history of the Middle East provided by FAMES at Cambridge. The faculty responded quickly to the changing needs and interests of students pursuing Arabic with Middle Eastern Studies by introducing modules on topical subjects like Political Islam, Human Rights in the Middle East, and Anthropology, which allowed students like me to undertake research that I was likely to use after university. The year abroad involved dizzying highs and lows, and in hindsight was one of the best things I have ever done. I chose Cambridge expressly because it was one of the only universities in the UK whose abroad programme was for the whole academic year, and which allowed students the flexibility of choosing where to go and what to do. In my case, this meant I was able to take a course in dressmaking alongside my language studies in Damascus.  I am now based in Jordan and continue to work with IOM on assistance to Syrian refugees. I have witnessed first hand the competitive edge that having a good level of Arabic proffers in this sector and part of the world, and am still grateful to my teachers and professors for insisting in equal measure on written and spoken Arabic. Although my career path may seem straightforward, I took a circuitous route getting here and it was not always apparent how I would apply my studies to the real world. Therefore the best advice I can give anyone is to stick to the language even when it seems impossibly tough, and to be true to your interests, because eventually you will find the right fit.  I have kept in touch with almost all of my teachers, who continue to offer invaluable guidance and encouragement. Likewise, I formed close ties with my year and we are still a tight group, bumping into each other regularly in different parts of the Middle East and, when we can, in the UK."Arianna Dini, AMES (Arabic)© 2017 University of Cambridge

web browser if you wish but then our site may not work correctly.Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern StudiesStudying at CambridgeThe qualifications required to do a BA in Middle Eastern Studies are not strictly defined. Arabic, Persian and Hebrew are all taught from scratch at Cambridge, so the course requires no prior knowledge of any of these languages. Students who wish to combine Middle Eastern Studies with a modern European language must have an 'A' level in their chosen European language. Please note that native speakers of one of the Middle Eastern Studies languages may not focus on that language as part of their BA studies.Our student intake for the course does vary, but on average we admit twenty undergraduates each year.The course is four years in duration, and is divided into two parts. Part I, lasting two years, will provide you with a thorough grounding in reading, writing, and speaking at least one Middle Eastern language and in the history and culture of the Middle East.The Tripos system is very flexible, and allows you to combine Middle Eastern Studies with a modern European language throughout your BA. You may also  change subject after completing Part I, either to study a completely unrelated subject, or to shift the emphasis within Middle Eastern Studies. For example, if you have combined languages in Part I you have the option of taking different proportions of either language in Part II, or of dropping one completely to concentrate on the other. Similarly, if you combine with a modern European language at Part I, you can continue to do so during Part II, or you can concentrate more on one or the other language.One of the distinctive strengths of Cambridge teaching is the supervision system, in which you have the opportunity to test out your ideas with a member of academic staff. This is a critical part of the pedagogical process, and we expect you to participate in a genuine dialogue in which you should challenge us as much as we, inevitably, will challenge you. In the first year you will have supervisions for language and for history, usually in pairs or small groups.During your first year, you will be given a thorough grounding in your chosen language(s), along with a general introduction to the history and culture of the Middle East. You will prepare for examination in four subject areas at the end of the year.Languages offered for study through the Department of Middle Eastern Studies are Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Biblical Hebrew and Modern Hebrew. Papers on Akkadian and Egyptian are also offered through the Department of Archaeology and Anthroplogy. If you study Arabic, Persian or Modern Hebrew in your first year, you will also prepare for an oral examination in that language. In addition to language study, you will need to choose at least one of the following papers: Introduction to the History and Culture of the Middle East or Introduction to the Contemporary Middle East.In your second year, you will continue with more detailed study in at least one of your chosen languages. You will have an oral exam if you study Arabic, Persian or Modern Hebrew. While enhancing your knowledge of the language through the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, you can also take classes in literature — reading texts in their original language — as well as classes in the history and culture of the region.If you wish to broaden your horizons yet further, three papers are available to you in the Department of Linguistics in the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages. Papers on Modern Judaism and Islam are also offered through the Faculty of Divinity.You will prepare for examinations in five subject areas at the end of your second year.The Year Abroad is one of the most rewarding parts of the degree course, where you have a chance to explore the language, society and culture of the Middle East for yourself. To encourage this exploration, you will choose how and where to spend your Year Abroad, as long as the country you choose is safe at the time, and you are spending the year doing something structured that involves considerable use of Arabic, Hebrew or Persian.All Middle Eastern Studies students, including those combining this with a European language, must spend at least eight months in the Middle East. They have another seven months between the end of their second year and the beginning of their fourth to spend where they wish. All students must spend at least two months following a structured course in the language they are studying, at one of a number of approved institutions in different countries, and some may spend the whole year doing this. There may also be the option of spending some of the year doing some sort of internship or voluntary work, alongside some private tuition in the language subject to Faculty Board approval. Some follow a university course (if approved by Cambridge University) that is taught to local students in the local language. This might have you learning Islam and Middle Eastern politics in Arabic, Persian literature in Farsi or Israeli literature in Hebrew. Students make their arrangements themselves, but the Department provides a great deal of information, support, and advice. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.As well as improving your language knowledge and getting a better feel for the culture and society, the Year Abroad allows you to gather material for a dissertation on a topic of your own choosing during the year, to be written up in your fourth year. You will receive guidance on this both before and during the year abroad. The dissertation mark counts double, so students start developing ideas for their research projects in second year. There is no requirement for you to take or pass exams or follow specific courses of study during the year abroad. What you achieve over the year is examined in your fourth year in your oral exam, your dissertation, and the way the knowledge and experience you have gained give breadth and depth to your other studies.More detailed information about the year abroad is given in each language area.Your final year comprises further advanced-level language work, plus special papers in fields of your interest. A major focus of the fourth year is writing a dissertation in close consultation with your supervisor. Final year courses offer in-depth perspectives on particular aspects of literature, history, anthropology, translation, and Islamic philosophy. © 2017 University of Cambridge

However if you ask any student of AMES whether they are happy to be there, it is a resounding yes."Katie Polglase, Part IB Arabic Studies "The Cambridge course also gives you the opportunity to set the boundaries of your own studies at many other points. One of the reasons I applied to Cambridge was because of the Department’s unique approach to the year abroad that allows you to decide exactly how you want to spend the third year of the degree. As long as you are either enrolled in a language program or doing actual work in the context of an Arabic environment, you can go pretty much anywhere in the Middle East that is safe to go to."Skandar Keynes, Part II BA Arabic and Persian "Within Hebrew Studies, it is possible - even encouraged - to explore a wide range of complementary fields, which help to add depth to the core language and cultural courses taught within the Hebrew department."Susannah Pearce, Part II BA Hebrew Studies© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan and counts more than 100 million speakers around the world. In the early modern period, Persian was the lingua franca for the educated élite in the Indian sub-continent, the language of the Moghul rulers of northern India and the vehicle for Moghul literature. It is still taught in many universities in India and Pakistan.Persian is perhaps most famous for its poetry; its fine epic and lyric poetry earmark it as one of the great canons of world literature. Great Persian poets like Omar Khayyam, Hafiz, Sa'di and Rumi have been beloved by Europeans reading their words in translation for over two hundred years: to read these poets in the original only adds to their depth and beauty. Persian is also the second language of Islam with many important works of history, literature, philosophy and Sufism (Islamic mysticism). Like true masterpieces, these works keep their appeal; their depth, scope and wit continue to fascinate us, opening vistas on the societies they address and reflect.Students of Persian benefit from the fact that the written and spoken forms of the language are close and have remained relatively constant over time. Students of Farsi are quickly able to communicate with the native speakers and to read a range of classical and modern materials.In our language classes, students will learn standard spoken of Persian (the form spoken in Tehran) and written Persian.During the year abroad, students spend some months studying in Iran in order to develop their language skills as well as learning more about Iranian culture and society.Iran is a key country in the Middle East and to know Persian is essential for those who want to be involved in this part of the world. You can become a translator, a journalist, or work in broadcasting. There is always demand from diplomatic services. Because of the recent changes in the Middle East, many multinational companies are starting investing in Iran so there are lots of opportunities in banking, commerce, oil and gas, and other international companies for those knowing Persian and with specialist knowledge of Iran.Persian has been studied and taught at Cambridge for many years by eminent scholars including E G Browne, R A Nicholson and A J Arberry. As a result, Cambridge has excellent resources in Persian studies. We teach classical and modern Persian language and literature and several history courses that cover Iran's history since the Islamic conquest to the twentieth century.© 2017 University of Cambridge

Options for combining study of the Persian language with a Modern Language are outlined [here].In your second year, the following papers are offered as part of the BA in Middle Eastern Studies: Intermediate Persian, Literary Persian, The Formation of Islam, The Formation of the Middle East and Contemporary Middle Eastern Politics and Society.You may combine a selection of these papers with other options from the Middle Eastern Studies Tripos offered by the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, the Department of Linguistics and the Faculty of Divinity. Options for continuing your Persian language studies alongside papers from the Modern Languages Tripos are outlined [here]. The object of the year abroad is to greatly develop your competence in the language and your understanding of the society and culture within which it is used. It is also the time to start work on a dissertation, on a topic of your choosing within the range that the Department can supervise. All year abroad plans need approval by the Faculty Board. Please note students for 2017 entry exact details of the year abroad are still being finalised.If you are studying towards the BA in Middle Eastern Studies, you are normally required to spend eight months in a Middle Eastern country. If you are studying Persian as a whole subject, you are required to spend eight months in a Persian-speaking country. If you are combining Persian with Arabic or Hebrew, you are required to spend at least four months in an Arabic-speaking country and at least three months in Israel or Iran, or an equivalent deemed appropriate, unless you are from a Hebrew- or Persian-speaking background.Most commonly, students spend three months at a university in Iran, either Tehran or Esfahan. It is often hard to get a visa for more than three months, and students combining with Arabic or Hebrew spend the rest of the year in a country relevant to those languages. Occasionally, entry into Iran is impossible, so students then spend time in Tajikistan, or sometimes study Persian elsewhere.If you are combining a Middle Eastern language with a Modern language, you are normally required to spend the full eight months in the Middle East. You are not required to spend any time in a country relevant to your European language.The two-year course in Part II consists of advanced-level language teaching, plus a number of special subject options. These options reflect the research interests of the teaching staff, and will give you an opportunity to study a particular subject within Persian Studies at a high level of detail. A dissertation of 12,000 words, usually connected with your special subject paper, is also a requirement.© 2017 University of Cambridge

However, after starting in Cambridge I realised that the course had so much more to offer beyond helping me meet a personal challenge. By the final year of the course, the language component only comprises a sixth of the program. The rest is filled by incredibly diverse options. During my undergraduate studies, aside from Arabic language, I have been able to study social and political anthropology, pre-modern and modern history, literature, and religious studies, all in relation to the Middle East. Furthermore, upon discovering more about the richness of Iranian culture and history, I decided to take on Persian in my second year. Considering the close links between the Persian and Arab worlds, learning the two languages in tandem facilitates the entire enterprise and often provides interesting linguistic insights into both.The Cambridge course also gives you the opportunity to set the boundaries of your own studies at many other points. One of the reasons I applied to Cambridge was because of the Department’s unique approach to the year abroad that allows you to decide exactly how you want to spend the third year of the degree. As long as you are either enrolled in a language program or doing actual work in the context of an Arabic environment, you can go pretty much anywhere in the Middle East that is safe to go to. This was great for me, as I was able to go to Lebanon and learn Lebanese colloquial Arabic, the original purpose of my studies. I was able to mix language immersion while gaining valuable experiences that I can actually put on my CV, (such as volunteering to help people with mental disabilities or teaching English while living in a village in the Lebanese mountains), with more formal instruction, which ensured that I maintained and furthered my written Arabic. All of this took me travelling across Lebanon and I was able to have a bit of the ‘gap yah’ I never had.Although it is a distant prospect for any prospective undergraduate, the final-year dissertation does provide you with a truly exceptional chance to research and write up any topic that falls within the blissfully broad parameters of Middle Eastern studies. I am certainly not alone in saying that this is one of the highlights of the course and one of its most rewarding parts. I have been writing a comparison between the teaching of history in Iran and Saudi Arabia. As part of this research, I have translated school textbooks from both countries. The excellent language instruction in this department has made this nowhere near as daunting a task as it might sound.As we work toward finishing our degrees, my classmates and I are now applying for various jobs in the fields of journalism, business, the civil service, think tanks, NGOs, and for further study. Having studied the languages and societies of the Middle East at Cambridge means that many doors are open to us.”© 2017 University of Cambridge

While it is anticipated that the year abroad will continue to be a mandatory requirement of the course, the Faculty may not in future be able to offer the financial support it has done in the past.Students still have to pay some fees to their home university during the year abroad, but the government has set a cap on this for future students of 15% of the usual fees.The Student Loan Company  significantly increases the loan for students spending a year abroad (from up to £5,555 for students in Cambridge  to up to £6,600 for  students spending a year abroad next year) see https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/loans-and-grants and it also provides a means tested travel grant (3 journeys after the first £303 and help with essential expenses, medical insurance and visas) – see https://www.gov.uk/travel-grants-students-england/what-youll-get.In addition the Faculty provides a small amount of financial support – more if you have proven financial need.Arrangements for this year abroad vary according to the subject studied:Chinese StudiesJapanese StudiesMiddle Eastern Studies© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is perhaps worth emphasising that both programmes are the same in content and are taught by highly competent teachers. Beijing is the capital city of China, and Qingdao is a medium-sized city (according to the Chinese standard) located on the east coast of China.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Chinese Studies is Dr Boping Yuan.Airfares from London to Beijing currently run to about £800 for a round-trip ticket (although tickets may be found for lower prices by booking far in advance or not taking direct flights), and an air ticket from Beijing to Qingdao (one-hour flight) costs about £80. Tuition fees are paid directly to the Chinese university on behalf of the students. (plus a deposit (approx. one-month rent), water/electricity/heating bills, and a commission charge (approx. one-month rent) if via an agent.)Please note that it is students' own responsibility if they choose to usean agent for finding accommodation in Beijing rather than staying in the University accommodation.  (plus a deposit (approx. one month rent), water/electricity/heating bills, and a commission charge (approx. one-month rent) if via an agent. )Please note that it is students' own responsibility if they choose to use an agent for finding accommodation in Qingdao rather than staying in the University accommodation.Each student will have to obtain a resident permit from a local public security bureau within 30 days of their arrival in China, which may cost £50 for a permit within 12 months. Students should contact their chosen Chinese university first when preparing all documents for resident permit application.If students are travelling in China prior to starting their courses at university, they will still have to obtain a residence permit within 30 days of arrival. Students need to apply for an "X" visa. The "L" and "F" visa may not be changed to the "X" visa in China Students will be required to have a health examination (if they have not done so in their home country before going to China), which may cost approximately £50. The costs for food, travel, and daily necessities are relatively inexpensive and vary with individual students. Students are encouraged to talk to fourth year students who studied in China to get useful information from them.Students are encouraged to take out medical and travel insurance. They should also be made aware that visitors need a passport valid for six months after their date of departure before they will be able to apply for a visa.Students will be required to sign a form [download here] agreeing to pay the fee to the Chinese university in full upon arrival, agreeing to abide by the arrangements and agreeing to reimburse the Faculty should they discontinue the course after their return from China.The Study Abroad Coordinator, Dr Boping Yuan, will be happy to answer questions about the period abroad.Contacts and correspondence address:Ms. LI KeInternational Students Division Office of International RelationsRoom 335, New Sun Student Centre Peking University Beijing, 100871 People’s Republic of China Email: etolike@pku.edu.cn   Tel: +86-10-627-58203  Fax: +86-10-627-59754Contacts and correspondence address:Mr. CHEN Zhixi or Prof. NING Aihua International Education Centre Ocean University of China 23 Eastern Hong Kong Road Qingdao, 266071 The People’s Republic of China Email: iec@mail.ouc.edu.cn, <iec@ouc.edu.cn> or czx@ouc.edu.cnTel: +86-532-5901666,   +86-532-5901555 Fax: +86-532-5901868The courses at both Peking University and Ocean University of China start around the beginning of September and finish around the end of June in the following year. There are breaks for  Mid-Autumn Festival (one day in September), National Day (about one week at the beginning of October), New Year's Day (one day), Spring Festival/Winter Vacation (which usually lasts from the middle of January until the middle of February), Qingming Festival (one day in early April) and Dragon Boat Festival (one day in June). Please note that Christmas is not a public holiday in China and you would not be expected to leave at this time.  There are 15 hours of teaching per week at both Peking University and Ocean University of China:Dissertation guidance/advice (upon request)While studying in China, Cambridge students should abide by the Chinese university's rules and regulations (including the Chinese university's academic calendar, examination arrangements, etc.). Students must attend all classes and take all the examinations, unless they have good reasons not to do so. There are exams in the middle and at the end of both the autumn and spring semesters. Peking University and Ocean University of China send the University of Cambridge a report of each student's academic performance, class attendance and examination results for the courses.F.  FinancesStudents who choose to set up a bank account in China will need to provide both their passports and residence permits.1. Students should fill in an Application Form for Foreign Students Wishing to Study in Peking University/Ocean University of China, which can be downloaded at Peking University (www.isd.pku.edu.cn/upload/2012011201385163703757.doc) and  Ocean University of China (as a Word or PDF document)    The completed form must be handed to Dr. Boping Yuan no later than Tuesday, 24th April, 2018.  2. Peking University and Ocean University of China are expected to send each student, in June, a notice of admission and necessary documents for a successful visa application at the Chinese Embassy in London.  Students should then apply for the visa as soon as possible.3. The University will collect the tuition fee at 15% of the normal rate while the student is abroad.  In general, Colleges do not charge College fees for students of Chinese while they are abroad but it is the responsibility of the student to confirm this with their own college.4. Students eligible for tuition fee or maintenance loans who are spending the year overseas with the agreement of their institution may be entitled to an increased maintenance loan and the 15% of the regular tuition fee loan (paid directly to the home institution). Students should log into their student finance account to change the details of their next year's application (specifying that they will be living outside the UK for all three terms) as soon as possible to avoid late arrival of loan payments.Students' finance is a tutorial matter and is not dealt with by the Faculty. Students must be aware that it is their responsibility to ascertain what level of support they can obtain.5. It is also the student's own responsibility to secure a visa for China. The official website of the China Visa Application Service Center can be found at www.visaforchina.org6. Students are advised to take out medical insurance in their home country before going to China. Specialised "year abroad" packages for students are available from some insurers.Students preparing for their year abroad may find the following, student-written, guide to some of the practicalities helpful: Chinese YA Guide (your Raven password will be required to download this PDF file from outside the University).  Students can also go to the Faculty Library to read a similar guide written by a different year group (It is catalogued as “Reference only” and it is not borrowable).© 2017 University of Cambridge

This is a good private university situated in the north of the city. The main campus is bordered by the extensive grounds of Shokokuji to the east and the old Imperial Palace to the south.2 It is expected that the majority of students will take advantage of this arrangement, which is by and large hassle free and provides a good base in one of Japan’s most attractive cities. However, there are other options for spending a year in Japan. The MEXT Undergraduate Scholarship in Japanese Studies is a generous scholarship offered by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and offers undergraduates an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the language and culture of Japan through study at a Japanese university (recent successful applicants have studied at institutions such as: Doshisha, Hitotsubashi, Keio, Kyoto, Osaka and Sophia universities). Alternatively the Japanese Studies group is in the process of establishing internship opportunities with a number of Japanese businesses (available from 2018), for more information please check our internships page for regular updates. If a student wishes to make his or her own plans this is possible but it should be noted that a) a detailed plan must be agreed to by the Study-Abroad Coordinator before the end of January at the latest, and b) no administrative help can be expected.3 For those applying to Doshisha the first deadline is 31st January. At this point the Dept. sends CJLC a list of those students who wish to go to Doshisha.4 CJLC will then send the necessary application forms and other material to each student. From this point on, all correspondence (in English) is between CJLC and the student concerned, with copies being sent to the Dept. No individually tailored references are required. You will have to provide the signature of a UK ‘guarantor’ (who would normally be the parent or guardian, not the College), because the legal age for adulthood in Japan is not 18 but 20. Japanese Immigration also demands that in order to obtain a student visa you must be able to guarantee a minimum of ¥1,200,000 (approx £8,100 at October 2017 exchange rate £1 approx.= ¥148) to cover living expenses for one year. On receipt of your application CJLC then applies to Japanese Immigration for a Certificate of Eligibility (zairyu shikaku nintei shomeisho), the guarantor for which is CJLC. Once this is in hand, you can obtain your student visa. Note that unless special arrangements are made well in advance, visas can only be issued at the Consulate in London.5 Each document will have its own deadline clearly marked. Failure to keep to any one of these deadlines may jeopardise your acceptance. The responsibility is yours and yours alone.6 Fees:7 Cost of livingDoshisha has several hostels and their monthly rents including use of internet and all utility bills are between ¥35,000 (approx.= £240) and ¥45,000 (approx.= £300) for the year 2017 and 18. You will probably need another ¥80,000 (approx.= £540) per month for your food, local transport etc but remember that if you are short of cash you can always do some arubaito which will allow you not only to have some extra money but also give you opportunities to meet people and to experience Japanese life outside the university campus. In addition you have to pay for the National Health Insurance. A year coverage for the year 2016-17 was ¥17,346 (approx.= £120). Depending on courses you choose you may have to pay for some teaching material but the entire cost should not go over ¥25,000 (approx.= £170)Please note that the figures above are approximate and calculated with the exchange rate of £1 approx.= ¥148 (October 2017) and it may change.8 Arrival and DepartureYou are expected to arrive either on the 6th or 7th of September 2017. The final exams end in early August 2018. There is a closing ceremony in mid-September but this is not compulsory.9 Teaching: there are two semesters and fees are calculated in terms of credits. The tuition fee covers 20 credits (10 per semester), which means, in essence, language classes Mon–Fri. In addition, other courses are available in CJLC up to a further 10 credits free of charge. Anything over these 10 credits will be charged at the normal rate. There is no obligation to attend any classes taught in English. There will be plenty of opportunity to get involved in other activities and the library and other facilities will be made available.10 Students’ performance will be evaluated at the end of each semester in accordance with normal CJLC practice. It is a requirement for the purpose of the exchange agreement and visa status to participate fully in classes and tests. There will be a placement test on arrival, but this does not tie the student to that level for the whole year. If appropriate, it is possible to move to a higher level course for the second semester.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Japanese Studies is Dr Miki Kawabata.© 2017 University of Cambridge

To encourage this exploration students choose for themselves how and where to spend their Year Abroad, as long as the country they choose is safe at the time, and they are spending the year doing something structured which involves considerable use of Arabic, Hebrew or Persian. All Middle Eastern Studies students, including those combining this with a European language, must spend at least eight months in the Middle East. They have another seven months between the end of their second year and the beginning of their fourth to spend where they wish.Some students spend the whole year following a structured course in the language they are studying, but many these days do some sort of internship or voluntary work, alongside some private tuition in the language. Some follow a university course such as politics, literature or Islam, taught to the locals in the local language. Students make their arrangements themselves, with the Department providing information, support and advice.As well as improving their language knowledge and getting a better feel for the culture and society, students gather material for a dissertation on a topic of their own choosing during the year, to be written up in their fourth year. They get guidance on this both before and during the year abroad. There is no requirement for students to take or pass exams or follow specific courses of study during the year abroad. What they achieve over the year is examined in their fourth year in their oral exam, their dissertation, and the way the knowledge and experience they have gained give breadth and depth to their other studies.Arabic: The countries our students spend the year in vary, according to their inclinations and the political conditions in the Middle East. For example in 2013 – 14 we have students in Jordan, Oman, the West Bank, the Sudan and Morocco. They spend the year doing a wide range of things, from assisting in a school in a north Lebanese town to helping in a Palestinian theatre company or a hospital, to interning with an Egyptian human rights organisation or working with a sailing company in Oman.Hebrew: Most students spend the year at a major university in Israel at Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa or Beer-Sheva. All of these universities have special programmes for overseas students, where they combine intensive language study with courses of their own choosing in subjects such as Israeli history, society, modern literature, Jewish thought, politics or Biblical studies. Some students do work or voluntary work instead, for some or all of the year.Persian: Students who are doing only Persian or combining Persian and an MML language spend their whole year abroad in Iran. Most commonly, students who are combining Persian with Arabic, or Hebrew spend three to four months at a university in Iran, particularly Tehran, Mashhad or Esfahan. All of these universities have special programmes for overseas students, where they combine intensive language study with literature courses. If for any reason students cannot obtain a visa to Iran they will spend their Year Abroad in Tajikistan where possible, or sometimes studying Persian somewhere else.The costs of the Year Abroad are very variable, depending on what a student chooses to do and where they choose to go. The costs below are approximate, based on current information.Worldwide travel insurance is available for around £200You will need to check with your local GP surgery what you will need. Most vaccinations are free of charge. For most Arabic-speaking countries you are likely to need typhoid, hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations. Anyone travelling to the Sudan will probably need vaccinating against meningitis (and there is likely to be a cost as only vaccination against meningitis C is free); anti-malarial medication is also likely to be necessary. You can buy this over the counter from a pharmacy.Cost of living: accommodation in Jordan away from the tourist areas can cost around £50 per month (including meals). In Morocco it is likely to cost between £80 and £150 per month, and up to £250 if meals are included.Food and other living expenses: in Jordan a cup of coffee is around 60p away from the tourist areas. In Morocco food costs vary, but are usually not very expensive. A cup of coffee is about 50p, a kilo of oranges could be 30p, you can eat a cheap bowl of lentils and bread and tea for 60p or a tagine for about £4. Getting around is also cheap, especially taxis. One student in Jordan commented ‘I would generally spend about 300 pounds a month, but more if I was sightseeing. Sightseeing and travelling around the touristy places, especially when I had people visiting from home, were by far my biggest costs.’Rial is Iranian official currency. But commonly people use the word Toman instead of Rial to express the amounts of money and prices of goods. The value of Toman is 10 times more than the value of Rial. For example 100 Rials is equal to 10 Tomans. So if a shirt is tagged 450,000 Rials, the clerk will say it is 45,000 Tomans.The exchange rate is usually unstable but at the moment one pound is equal to 47,000 Rials or as Iranians say 4,700 Tomans.Cost of living: accommodation provided by universities and Persian centres in Iran are about £150 to £200 per month.Food and other living expenses: It really depends on each individual. In Iran a cup of coffee can be around £3, though in the universities café it can be much cheaper around £1.5. In general food and restaurants are slightly cheaper than the UK. So depending on your life style in the UK, you may have to spend the same amount for food in Iran.Transportation is relatively cheap in Iran (except flights). In Tehran, the single bus tickets can be less than 20p and the hired taxi can start from £2. In the city it shouldn’t be more than £6 for long journeys. Underground/Metro in Tehran is a great means of transportation. A single trip is around 20p and a return can be around 30p. If you have a Metro credit card (which is something like Oyster card), the single fare can drop to 10p.The most popular Israel Shekel exchange rate is the ILS to USD rate, hence the dollars referred to below.Accommodation: $160/week (Hebrew University accommodation)Food: around 150 shekels/week (really depends on the person though). A pastry in a campus café is around 7 to 10 shekels. The cost of a coffee really depends on where you go - at the low end around 3 shekels in a campus café.Mobile phone: on contract $35/month (includes unlimited calling, texting and 3G data within Israel, and unlimited calling to UK)Transport: a light rail ticket costs 6.90 shekels (for unlimited usage within a 90 minute period on the light rail and Egged buses). A discount can be obtained by buying a student card.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Arabic Studies is Mrs Farida El-Keiy.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Hebrew Studies is Dr Aaron Hornkohl.The Study Abroad Co-ordinator for Persian Studies is Dr Mahbod Ghaffari.© 2017 University of Cambridge
