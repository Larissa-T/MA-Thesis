Some in the arts & humanities consider the SOP the most important component of your admission application.The SOP has been described as an intellectual résumé and is one of the most, if not the most, important components of your application in the majority of the arts & humanities programs. In addition to the nuts and bolts of the information provided in the SOP, faculty members look for intellectual vitality and promise in the SOP that indicate one's preparedness for the highest level graduate work.Basically, in the SOP, faculty want to learn the highlights of your academic preparation for their program, your research or creative future interests, and why Berkeley is a good fit for you. However, do not only cover these points. Related personal stories, intellectual musings, or significant events bring you and your background to life. Following are three items that you specifically cover in your SOP.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. The Huang Program provides UC Berkeley students with the opportunity for enhanced and intensive Chinese language instruction at Berkeley, as well as language instruction and internships in China. A two-year commitment is required. Each winter, approximately ten scholars are selected to enter the program, based on their dedication to studying Chinese and their vision for the role that China and the Chinese language will play in their futures. Students attend an eight-week intensive language course in Beijing. Travel and living expenses, as well as partial tuition, are paid for by the program (students are responsible for eight credits of tuition). Upon returning to Berkeley, students in the Huang Program take fourth-year Chinese. The following summer they are awarded internships in China in fields related to their interests. Travel and living expenses once again are covered by the program.Watch the video about the Huang Scholars ProgramThe program enrolls students from a number of majors. We do not look for any particular profile, but rather aspire to assemble a group that is diverse in all aspects. Applicants should have a 3.75 average in Chinese classes as well as a 3.6 GPA overall.The application can be found under "Forms," below. Please submit your application and transcripts by e-mail to: huangprogram@berkeley.edu or to the Huang Program mailbox located in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures, 3413 Dwinelle Hall.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. Revyn CrowleyRevyn Crowley is a junior majoring in American Studies.

Yet the research in diversity shows that groups with more diversity perform better than other more uniformed groups. Companies with a diverse employee base tend to produce better financially. Overall, there are many strands of research showing unequivocally why diversity matters. That is the true Strength of Diversity: we are better when many points of views are included in our day-to-day lives.Colette Patt, Ph.D., Director of Diversity Programs, Mathematical & Physical Sciences DivisionThe Berkeley Edge Program, NSF-AGEPUniversity of California, Berkeley101 Durant Hall, MC 2920Berkeley, CA 94720-2920Phone: 510-642-0794Fax: 510-643-2261E-mail: berkeleyedge@berkeley.eduBSN website:  bsn.berkeley.eduL&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. Contact professors with whom you'd like to work.

In the best tradition of a liberal arts education, our courses encourage students to explore fascinating new worlds of knowledge. Our academic enrichment programs serve students at every stage of their undergraduate careers, from the initial years of intellectual exploration through the process of finding and pursuing an in-depth academic focus. Several of these programs are curricular and others are co-curricular; however, in each case our goal is to enhance the liberal arts education of the student participants.Hallmarks of a first-year L&S curriculum are the more than 100 small-group freshman and sophomore seminars and the dozens of Discovery Courses taught by legendary Berkeley faculty. These teaching jewels offer undergraduates a great way to explore new and exciting fields of study.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. The Council of Undergraduate Deans is an advisory group to the executive vice chancellor and provost, chaired by the dean of Undergraduate Studies.

The initiative provides students and faculty in L&S with convenient access to the Berkeley-Haas Entrepreneurship Program's programs and resources. L&S has decided to embark in this new direction in light of a significant shift in the research, cultural and technological environments in which knowledge is now being acquired, both here on campus and around the world. Three major factors contribute to this shift: L&S is making research opportunities a reality for an exceptionally large number of undergraduates; the boundaries between academic disciplines are rapidly disappearing; and students have access to enormous amounts of information and are highly connected with one another — factors that are bound to encourage the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship.L&S now sponsors two entrepreneurship courses especially designed for liberal arts majors.L&S 5: Introduction to Entrepreneurship is designed for freshmen and sophomore non-business majors who wish to learn about entrepreneurship, its importance to our society, and its role in bringing new ideas to the market. The course is a collaboration between the College of Letters & Science and the Berkeley-Haas Entrepreneurship Program. Students learn about the entrepreneurial business process and how they might become involved in this processes in their future careers.The Berkeley-Hass Entrepreneurship Program is the focal point at UC Berkeley for the study and promotion of entrepreneurship and innovation in management and new enterprise development. It serves everyone in the campus community with entrepreneurial interests. The program's location at the Haas School of Business allows undergraduate and graduate students from all departments on campus to connect with business leaders and to network and collaborate with each other.Programs of special interest to L&S students include:Please visit the Berkeley-Haas Entrepreneurship Program's website for more information. L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. As you consider graduate school programs and evaluate your academic preparation, consider the steps you can take to become more competitive.The statement of purpose (SOP) has been described as an intellectual résumé and is one of the most — if not the most — important components of your application.

Our major and minor programs attract undergraduates who wish to explore the most intellectually engaging and promising interdisciplinary fields under the direction of scholars who are pioneers in charting these new areas and methods of inquiry. UGIS has been, and continues to be, an incubator for new ideas — including experimental programs and courses — as well as offering a curriculum designed to promote the ideals of a liberal arts education.In addition to the major programs administered through L&S's five divisions, Letters & Science has agreements with several professional schools and colleges on campus for the following non-divisional undergraduate major programs:L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. In addition to the major programs administered through the College of Letters & Science's five divisions, L&S has agreements with several professional schools and colleges on campus for the following non-divisional undergraduate major programs:Chemistry is the science that deals with the composition, structure and properties of matter and the changes they undergo.

Students who do not clear academic probation by the end of the next semester (fall or spring) of enrollment will be subject to dismissal by the College of Letters & Science. It is very important for students to meet with a College Adviser to understand their academic status and make sure they are aware of the steps they should take to return to good academic standing.Effective Spring 2016, the regulations governing Academic Probation and dismissal in the College of Letters & Science have changed. As a result, students can be placed on probation due to the impact of deficient grades, or by failing to complete any letter graded coursework.These changes have direct practical implications:There are numerous scenarios that may arise as a result of the amended Academic Senate regulations. Please meet with a College Adviser if you have questions about your situation.1.5 Term Probation2.0 Academic Probation1) Meet with a College Adviser 2) Attend a College of Letters & Science Reach for Success workshop.Tuesday, January 23, 2018 from 3-5pm in 262 Evans or Thursday, January 25, 2018 from 4-6pm in 262 Evans3) Check in with your College Adviser after you have received midterm grades.4) Attend a College of Letters & Science Save Your Semester Workshop on:Monday, March 19, 2018 from 3-5pm in 262 EvansorThursday, March 22, 2018 from 3-5pm in 262 EvansNote: official grades are not posted until several weeks after the close of the semester, and consequently there is a delay in letting you know if you have cleared probation. To determine your status as soon as possible, ask your instructors for final grades.Students who do not clear probation with their probationary term grades are “Subject to Dismissal.” Students who are subject to dismissal are reviewed by the Dismissal Review Committee and are either dismissed from the University or continued on probation. Please review more information below. 1) Meet with College Adviser as soon as possible to talk about options and next stepsContinue On Probation (COP) Letters should include:Fall 2017: Continue on Probation Letters are due Monday, Dec. 18, 2017 by 4:00pm. Spring 2018: Continue on Probation Letters are due Monday, May 14, 2018 by 4:00pm.2) Review the Dismissal Review Committee process below.What We Do: Once final grades are posted, the Dismissal Review Committee (DRC) reviews student records and makes a final  determination about dismissal. The Committee consists of L&S Deans and the Director of the Office of Undergraduate Advising.Comprehensive Review: In addition to considering academic performance indicators such as GPA, the DRC comprehensive review includes, but is not limited to, the following:How Students are NotifiedThe Dean of the College of Letters & Science notifies students of dismissal and continue on probation decisions by email within four weeks of official posting of grades.Students who are DismissedAppeals of a DRC decision to DismissL&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. The GPA calculator will be relocated on this page.

Schedule an appointment to meet a College Adviser at anytime.2) Take care of yourself. Don't forget to eat right and to get enough sleep. If you are feeling very stressed out by probation or by anything else, please contact the Tang Center counselors at (510) 642-9494.3) Read all of the e-mails that you receive from the College! Check your spam folder.4) Check out the Student Learning Center (SLC).The SLC is an excellent resource for all students. Many students have taken advantage of a variety of SLC programs. Among the programs offered in Fall 2017 are the following:Education 98/198: Growing Optimized Active Learning Strategies (G.O.A.L.S for Success)Enrollment information:Tuesdays 12-2 pm in 55 EvansEDUC 98 Sec. 11 CCN: 40032EDUC 198 Sec. 11 CCN: 40080Wednesdays 6-8 pm in 50 BarrowsEduc 98 Sec. 12 CCN: 40033Educ 198 Sec. 12 CCN: 40081Thursdays 10-12 noon in 201 GianniniEDUC 98 Sec. 42 CCN: 39983EDUC 198 Sec. 42 CCN: 66962The next section:Education 98/198: Exploring Learning Differences, Embracing Divergent Thinking and CreativityEnrollment information:Wednesdays 10-12pm in 279 DwinelleEDUC 98 Sec. 17 CCN: 40038EDUC 198 Sec. 17 CCN: 40101Other SLC services include Strategic Learning Coaching, for students experiencing academic difficulty; and Academic Success Study Strategies Workshops.5) Choose your courses wisely. Do not take a heavy course load this semester to "catch up." Taking too many units because you are worried that you are "behind" is a risky choice that steeply increases your odds of academic dismissal. L&S College Advisers are available to help you to choose the courses that will work best for you each semester.6) Know Your Deadlines. Before each deadline, ask yourself, how am I doing in all of my classes? Do I need to drop one? Talk to a College Adviser if you are having any trouble in a class.7) Repeating Courses: Repeating courses in which a student received a grade of D+ or lower is often a good idea – but sometimes not. If a student is not certain that the student can perform better in the course, repeating it may not be the best decision.Students must be aware of the following when repeating classes under the College's repeat rules:Keep in mind that repeating a class in which a student has earned a “not passed” (NP) on a letter-graded basis will not help the student to clear probation unless the grade earned is above C; therefore students on probation should not plan to repeat any NP grades unless they have returned to good academic standing.8) Incomplete grades: Students are required to discuss any work that is incomplete (“I”) with their professor. For more information about I grades, including policies, deadlines and extensions and/or “freezing” of the grade, please review Incomplete Grades.9) UC Berkeley Summer Sessions: Students cannot clear academic probation nor can they become subject to dismissal after completing a Berkeley Summer Sessions term. A student can only clear probation or be subject to dismissal during a probationary term, defined as a regular fall or spring semester. Using Berkeley Summer Sessions WISELY may help students reduce their grade point balance deficit so that it is easier to clear after their probationary term.*Important Note: Students enrolling in UC Berkeley Summer Sessions to meet conditions set by the L&S in order to be continued on probation for a fall semester must meet the conditions or are subject to dismissal.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. Interested in a change of college to Letters & Science?  Please attend a workshop if you have questions for the Fall 2017 or Spring 2018 petition period for change of college into Letters & Science.

Once registered, you are eligible to withdraw on or after the first day of instruction.  Read Cal Student Central's withdrawal information.  If you decide to discontinue your studies for an upcoming semester, no action is required other than to cancel your registration for the upcoming term via CalCentral before instruction begins.  If you did not enroll in any classes for the semester you wish to cancel, the cancellation will occur automatically.  If you are enrolled or waitlisted in classes and decide to cancel that enrollment (including waitlisted classes), you must submit a Withdrawal Request form on CalCentral before instruction begins. If you need to terminate your studies during a fall or spring semester (i.e. after instruction begins), please review Cal Student Central's withdrawal information.  You also are expected to meet with a College Adviser to review your plan to withdraw. Failure to file for withdrawal will result in the assignment of F or NP grades in all courses for the semester.  After any break in enrollment in a regular semester, you will need to apply for readmission in preparation for return. If you plan to attend another institution while you are away, be sure to connect to a College Adviser about how it will affect your overall academic plan.Contact Berkeley Summer Sessions with questions about procedures for withdrawal from Summer Sessions.To return to Berkeley, review the Readmission process.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. Students who do not meet the terms of academic probation may be dismissed from the College. This is not necessarily the end of a student's academic career at UC Berkeley. Many strong students have been dismissed and have been able to return and graduate from Berkeley. In order to resume studies at Berkeley, students will need to be readmitted by the Deans' Conference.Please note: For students who are not dismissed by the College of Letters & Science, there is a separate readmission process. Please review Applying for Readmission After An Absence. You should meet with a College Adviser to discuss terms to apply for readmission and a program plan for your request. General guidelines include:Once you have completed your first term elsewhere, you should make an appointment with a College Adviser to prepare for an appointment with an Assistant Dean.  At that meeting, you will need to report your grades from your first term and for classes you are currently enrolled in. The Assistant Dean will ask you to describe the challenges that led to your academic difficulties and explain how you are resolving them. The Assistant Dean will determine if your case is ready to be submitted to the Deans' Conference, which is the committee that will make the final decision on your readmission. If you have applied to the Deans' Conference twice, you must receive support from a College Adviser to forward your case for committee review.Students must review and submit the Deans' Conference checklist to complete their packet. Deadlines for submitting packets are June 1 for fall readmission and November 1 for spring. However, in order to be on time for your Phase I registration appointment, it is strongly recommended to submit before the deadlines (April-May for fall or September-October for spring).During readmission season (October-December, May-July) written requests will be reviewed on a first-come first-served basis. All other submissions must be received the Friday before a meeting.Students do not attend the Deans' Conference meeting.Students need to bring their documents to the appointment with the Assistant Dean. If the Assistant Dean appointment is scheduled after the June 1 or November 1 deadline, students should submit their packet to 206 Evans Hall, addressed to the Deans' Conference, by the readmission deadline.It is possible to graduate while on dismissal status, but only if all remaining degree requirements can be fulfilled without further course work at Berkeley in a fall or spring semester. In this case, the readmission request is only for the purpose of reinstating current student status in order to graduate. Outstanding requirements may be completed with courses from a community college, UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, or UC Extension XB or XBW courses. Senior residence cannot be met through UC Extension.​If you wish to pursue this type of request, meet with a College Adviser and your undergraduate major adviser (UMA) to check your academic progress to make sure that remaining requirements can be completed outside of fall or spring enrollment at Berkeley. If you have completed all requirements or are enrolled in your final courses, you are ready to submit your request.If you plan to enroll in UC Berkeley Extension or Berkeley Summer Sessions while you are in dismissal status, meet with an Assistant Dean for approval to earn units and grade points.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. A grade of Incomplete (noted "I" on the transcript) may be assigned when a student has completed and passed a majority of the work required for a course but, for reasons beyond the student's control, cannot complete the entire course. Incomplete grades are contingent upon instructor approval, and instructors are under no obligation to grant them. In cases where an instructor agrees to assign an I grade, it is important to arrive at an agreement about exactly what is required in order to finish the course and what percentage of the grade will be based on the remaining work. Review the Office of the Registrar's procedures for Incomplete grades.Incomplete grades received in the fall must be completed by the first day of instruction of the following fall semester. Those received in the spring or summer must be completed by the first day of instruction of the following spring semester. Failure to meet deadlines will result in the assignment of an F or an NP grade for the course.Requests for an extension of a deadline for completion of an I grade are subject to instructor approval. To make a request, print a copy of the Petition to Extend an Incomplete Grade, complete the student portion, ask the instructor to complete the form, and submit it to the Office of Undergraduate Advising, 206 Evans Hall, in a sealed departmental envelope. Extension of I grades are subject to the approval of the Letters and Science dean.After coursework has been completed and a final grade assigned, petitions are submitted directly to the Office of the Registrar by the instructor. The College does not accept or process these petitions.  Review the Office of the Registrar's procedures and form for Incomplete grades.Up to two Incomplete grades can be retained permanently on the record (this is often called "freezing an Incomplete"). (You must adhere to the same completion deadlines noted in the first paragraph under "Guidelines for Incomplete Grades".) To retain an I grade permanently, submit a Petition to Retain an Incomplete Grade Permanently on Record within the deadline for completing the course. No approval is necessary, but consider carefully before choosing this course of action; it is irreversible, and courses with a permanently retained I grade cannot be repeated.Graduating seniors who are on the current degree list and have I grades in classes required for the degree must complete the coursework by the last day of the term in order to graduate. If the course is not needed for graduation, the I will remain on the transcript indefinitely and will never lapse to an F or NP. Deadlines for finishing course work for an Incomplete grade apply even to those who are not currently enrolled at Berkeley and to those participating in the Education Abroad and UCDC programs.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. The Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) grading option was designed to encourage students to explore new academic areas or take challenging, far-ranging courses without undue concern about grades. Passed grades require a level of performance at least equal to a letter grade of C-.

For freshmen, the EGT is assigned at the projected 8th semester of enrollment, for transfers at the 4th semester. You can confirm your EGT in the 'Term Information' section (below your photo) on My Academics in Cal Central. Once enrollment appointments are announced for your EGT, your status will be updated on My Academics to indicate that your EGT will be the final term to complete all degree requirements. Read on to find out more about planning for your EGT, as well as information on obtaining early proof of graduation, ordering official transcripts and diplomas, and participating in commencement ceremonies. If you have an EGT for the 2017-2018 academic year (i.e. fall 2017, spring 2018, or summer 2018), review important deadline information for the appropriate EGT term posted on the right side of this webpage.Before you enroll in classes at Berkeley for your EGT semester, it is essential that you check to make sure that classes you have chosen will satisfy any remaining degree requirements.You should also consider other factors that may require an adjustment to your EGT:Contact the L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising and your Undergraduate Major Adviser to go over a plan to complete your requirements and determine a new EGT.If you plan to attend UCEAP for your final semeser or summer, your EGT must be coordinatined with the completion of the UCEAP program so that courses and grades are posted to your record in time to review and clear you for graduation. You may need to meet with an L&S adviser to determine your eligibilty for moving an EGT to a later semester/term.If a prospective employer or graduate school requires proof that you have completed your degree requirements, before degrees are officially conferred by the Academic Senate you may petition for either a Certificate of Completion, or Expedited Degree. These requests are submitted at Cal Student Central, and can only be processed four weeks after the end of the graduating term.If you are in your graduating term and your prospective employer, or graduate school needs proof you have either completed your degree requirements or will complete your degree with "in progress" coursework, before the end of your graduating term you can request a Proof of Intent to Graduate letter. This request needs to be submitted to an L&S College Adviser with the following:A College Adviser can only provide your "Intent to Graduate" letter in a scheduled advising appointment. Please bring all aforementioned requirements to your appointment.An official transcript reflecting your degree is normally available 6 to 8 weeks after posting of final grades.  Diplomas are mailed about four months after the end of your graduating term.  You can verify your diploma mailing address is accurate by logging on to CalCentral and updating your Profile (under Community) or through the Office of the Registrar.Commencement ceremonies are conducted in the months of May and December.Participation in commencement ceremonies does not mean that you have officially graduated. In many cases, major departments allow students with some outstanding requirements to participate in commencement.

That is why a prospective applicant should be familiar with the requirements on departmental websites. Also, from year to year a department may change its requirements. If there is one requirement that students dread, it is taking the GRE. For this reason, it is a good idea to get it over with as soon as possible, if it is required. You may also be required to take a subject test: for example, the English subject test.

Therefore, an applicant should place considerable importance and a great amount of effort into producing a writing sample. In general, admission committees evaluate an applicant's ability to synthesize ideas, concepts, or theories, and logically take a stand and argue them. Faculty would like to admit potential graduate students whose intellectual abilities and curiosity are highly advanced and are evident in the writing sample. They want to see that the student has mastered a foundation of the discipline, is able to intelligently query new areas of scholarly opportunity, or has contributed to the scholarly foundation with new research. Please consider the following items when contemplating your writing sample.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. Letters of recommendation are another important component of your application materials. They provide a professional opinion of your intellectual abilities and preparation for graduate school, and are usually written by a professor who not only addresses your specific strengths, but compares you to the many students with whom the professor has worked during his or her career. In other words, the admission committee wants to know how you "stack up" against all the students the recommender has ever had!

This statement is an important component of your overall application. Please note that the Personal Statement should not duplicate the Statement of Purpose (Form F). Please provide a statement about how your personal history or experiences have influenced your intellectual development and future goals. This statement can include a discussion of educational and cultural opportunities or of circumstances that deprived you of these; family background; economic circumstances; special interests and abilities; and community or social service involvement, especially as they intersect your academic goals and intellectual pursuits. If more space is required, you may attach another page."You should not leave this field empty or defer to the statement of purpose if you want to be considered for a university fellowship.The personal statement should focus on your personal background or experiences that have significantly influenced you or your goals. What does this mean? You should include aspects of your life that have been significant, but are not primarily academic. It is difficult to separate personal from academic neatly, but if the two intersect considerably, then provide the academic details in the statement of purpose and briefly refer to the situation in the personal statement. In the past, some students have been awarded a university fellowship by not addressing any of the items below, but it is uncommon and your application is more competitive if you do. Below is a summary of each part of the personal statement instructions, to assist you in understanding the directions:There is also information that should not be included in the personal statement. Although an individual may have experienced a deeply troubling personal incident, such as rape or incest from which they have emerged stronger, it is not appropriate to provide too much detail. Also, sex and drugs in general are taboo. Be careful what you discuss in the personal statement.

Charles was so confident in the game’s potential that he launched it entirely with personal funds. “I think the game will sell,” Charles reassured his wife, Lillian Qian. Charles’s instincts proved correct: Guitar Hero was an instant sensation. The interactive game, which enables users to simulate the experience of being a rock star while playing a guitar-shaped controller, captured rave reviews and achieved a record-breaking $1 billion in North American retail sales in just 18 months.Charles majored in economics and Asian studies at UC Berkeley and spent a transformative year studying in Beijing. He originally aspired to become a professor of Chinese history, but his life took a different course when he and his brother Kai, class of ’94, formed RedOctane, a company that introduced the first online video game rental service. Spurred by the popularity of music video games in Japan, the brothers concluded there was a market for similar products in North America and created the series of Guitar Hero games. “We didn’t know how successful it would be, but we knew we had a successful product that people would pay for,” Charles recalls.In 2006, Charles and Kai were named among the 50 top producers in new media by the Producers Guild of America New Media Council.Charles and Lillian live in the Silicon Valley with their two school-aged daughters.Inspired by Charles’s experience studying abroad, Charles and Lillian have generously endowed the Charles Huang Advanced Study of Chinese Fund at UC Berkeley. Their gift will enable up to 50 Berkeley students to gain a deep understanding of Chinese language and culture by exposing them to two summers of study in Beijing along with specialized Chinese studies during the school year at Berkeley. “When you get a chance to spend time in other parts of the world, you see things differently,” Charles says.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. Lanchih PoHi everyone,I am associate adjunct professor in International and Area Studies and the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at UC Berkeley.

In this program, experienced graduate students will be matched in a mentoring relationship with first- and second-year graduate students in a similar field of study. Mentors will develop leadership, communication and mentorship skills, while offering guidance and support to students who are facing particularly challenging periods of graduate school, such as the initial transition, first-year courses, and preliminary and qualifying exams. It is our hope that both mentors and mentees will see this as an opportunity to grow professionally.Participants will be matched by graduate program, or by related graduate program. Mentors will be required to meet with their mentees once per week at a time that is mutually convenient. The BSN-BSC will hold a regular luncheon seminar. These seminars will be held weekly each semester. Mentors and mentees will be encouraged to attend as many as possible, and required to attend at least one per month.Mentors will gain the opportunity to help promote graduate student retention in the sciences, make a friend, develop new skills, and become a role model. As a mentee, you will make connections, get guidance on navigating the first years of graduate school from experienced graduate students, and start to develop a support system for your graduate education. Mentors will be paid a stipend each semester and will be reimbursed for any meals or activities shared with their mentees over the course of the semester. Finally, mentorship is an important skill that can be carried on through one’s career as an academic and professional.Potential mentors need to apply; students who'd like to be mentored should register.For more information, please contact:Colette Patt, Ph.D., DirectorIra Young, Associate DirectorThe BSN-BSC Program510-642-0794/510 642-5777berkeleyscienceconnections@berkeley.eduWho is eligible?All first- and second-year graduate students are eligible to register and request to be mentored. Third-year students and beyond who have passed their preliminary and/or qualifying exams are eligible to apply to serve as mentors.What is the commitment?A one-semester commitment is required; a two-semester commitment is preferred. Senior students will mentor one mentee for at least one semester, and up to, but no longer than four semesters.How much time will this require?You should reserve enough time to meet in person with your mentor/mentee (two to four times per month), to attend a lunchtime seminar (once per month), and to exchange e-mails and/or other communication that is relevant.How often are mentors paid?Mentors will be paid once a semester, at the end of the semester.What if I already serve as a mentor to a first-year student in my program?

Visit the career center in your school and speak with counselors who may help you with university guide books and other resources. Speak with professors in the area of your interest for their recommendations. Look at the overall ranking of the institution as well as the specific ranking of the department. For each institution, identify faculty members with whom you might find an intellectual match.Think big and apply to at least five top-notch schools. Don't underestimate your intellectual ability and skills. Don't submit a generic application to all the schools. Modify your statement of purpose to suit the specific school in question and name the professors with whom you'd like to work and why.Look into financial options. If you can help it, don't count on taking out big loans to put yourself through graduate school. Regardless of how well-endowed any institution is, also apply for extramural funding from the Mellon Foundation, Ford Foundation, Jacob Javitts, and National Science Foundation, among others.Ask questions.

That is, don't say how dedicated or committed you are; show it by describing your accomplishments. Use positive language and avoid the passive voice.Be sure that your thoughts flow from one paragraph to the next.Stay focused on your research: past, present, and future.If there is an aberration in your record, explain in positive terms what happened with that particular course or semester.Be sure to find a critical reader who will look over the statement for you.Writing the Statement of PurposePart 1: IntroductionWrite two sentences or so on how [sociology, history, anthropology, or political science, etc.] first grabbed you. (The History Department is particularly fond of lyrical writers.) In good writing, God is in the details. Stay away from saying the predictable. Use colorful language. Let your personality come through in your writing. And briefly introduce what it is you want to pursue in graduate school.Part 2: Academic Biography Part 3: Graduate Research ProjectSpeak about a specific project you want to pursue in graduate school. In some ways everything you've written thus far should lead up to the point you make here. Even if you are not sure, it is important that you choose something concrete to speak of. The committee needs to see how you think through a specific research project. Intellectual clarity and zip: that's what the committee is looking for.Part 4: Why UC Berkeley?Why did you choose Berkeley? With whom would you work and why? What do you like about the department?

They provide a professional opinion of your intellectual abilities and preparation for graduate school, and are usually written by a professor who not only addresses your specific strengths, but compares you to the many students with whom the professor has worked during his or her career. In other words, the admission committee wants to know how you "stack up" against all the students the recommender has ever had! In general, most programs/universities require three letters of support.As you move through your undergraduate years and into graduate school, you will have increasing contact with graduate students and faculty in your discipline. Knowing how to interact with them can be helpful as you begin to negotiate a larger sphere with future colleagues and mentors. Building strong relationships begins with your initial interactions with busy faculty members and graduate students. As you begin to apply to graduate school, please keep the following suggestions in mind:In the humanities, the writing sample is just as crucial, if not more crucial, than the statement of purpose. Therefore, an applicant should place considerable importance and a great amount of effort into producing a writing sample. In general, admission committees evaluate an applicant's ability to synthesize ideas, concepts, or theories, and logically take a stand and argue them. Faculty would like to admit potential graduate students whose intellectual abilities and curiosity are highly advanced and are evident in the writing sample.The Graduate DivisionGSI Teaching and Resource CenterThe Graduate AssemblyGraduate Diversity OutreachAcademic ServicesFor a regularly updated list of graduate programs along with their application deadlines, please visit the Berkeley Graduate Division website.L&S Deans' OfficeArts & HumanitiesBiological SciencesMathematical & Physical SciencesSocial SciencesUndergraduate StudiesContact UsCopyright © 2017 UC Regents; all rights reservedPowered by Open BerkeleyThe intellectual heart of UC Berkeley, the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is the largest of the university’s 14 colleges and schools and the most prestigious teaching and research unit in the UC system. The L&S Office of Undergraduate Advising, with a staff of highly skilled and experienced college advisers, is here to help you make the best choices for your academic career and get the most out of your time at Berkeley.The College of Letters & Science stands at the heart of Berkeley’s intellectual preeminence and comprehensive excellence.  Our continued leadership in education, research, and public service depends on private philanthropy. This year, for the first time, the College of Letters & Science provided an academic welcome as part of the new student orientation.
