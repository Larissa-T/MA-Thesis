It is run by the University Library.The repository stores a range of content and provides different levels of access, but its primary focus is on providing open access to the University’s research publications.Apollo forms an important part of the University’s provision for meeting research funder requirements for open access, enabling ‘Green’ access to publications. For further information, see our Open Access pages, or to register your publication for ‘Green’ or ‘Gold’ access, please use the Open Access upload form.Over the past ten years, Apollo has participated in a number of externally funded projects intended to better understand researcher requirements or improve the services it offers.

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgeThe Philosophy Faculty uses paper questionnaires for evaluating lectures. Hard copies of these questionnaires will be handed out for each lecture series, in the last lecture of term. If, for any reason you miss out on completing one of these questionnaires, please download and complete a lecture questionnaire, making sure to note which lecture you refer to. Completed questionnaires should then be returned to the Faculty Office, or placed in the box by the photocopier outside the office.Logic Classes and Discussion Groups are also assessed by paper questionnaires, handed out in the last class of the term. If for any reason you miss your last class, please download and complete the relevant questionnaire, making sure to note the name of your class leader.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgePost TriposAs a Cambridge undergraduate/graduate you can use the Cambridge University Careers Service as often as you like.Deciding to read philosophy at Cambridge does not commit you to a narrow range of careers. Our graduates include an RAF test pilot as well as IT consultants, management consultants, fund-raisers, civil servants, lawyers, arts administrators and teachers.Many of our students choose to carry on with further study towards graduate degrees such as the  M.Phil. and Ph.D. in philosophy. For some of them philosophy will become their career; the last time we tried to count, there were 58 people holding senior posts in philosophy departments around the world who started their philosophical careers by reading for the Cambridge Philosophy Tripos.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge The Philosophy Tripos enables students to develop the following transferable skills:These skills are all central to the study of Philosophy. Responsibility for fostering them is divided between the Faculty and the Colleges. They are developed in lectures, classes, discussion groups, seminars, supervisions and examinations.Writing skills are practised in weekly essays, submitted essays and dissertations. Since it is principally supervisors who help students to improve their writing, this aspect of their development is primarily the responsibility of Directors of Studies.Responsibility for the development of oral skills falls both to the Faculty, which organises discussion groups and seminars in which students debate philosophical issues, and to Directors of Studies, who arrange supervisions for students and in some cases run College seminars.Since philosophy students are mainly supervised individually or in pairs, they have plenty of opportunity to develop their oral skills through philosophical discussion. Within the University there are also societies and reading groups where students can refine their oral skills.Philosophy students are, from the beginning of their course, encouraged to work independently and to explore problems on their own initiative. Lecturers and supervisors encourage these skills by providing bibliographies, and referring to articles or books which students may then go and read. An independent approach is also fostered by the fact that students are free to attend any lectures given for the Philosophy Tripos (and indeed any lectures given in the University). Furthermore, submitted essays and Part II dissertations require students to make informed choices and enable them to follow up their own interests.The task of developing an ability to use time productively falls mainly to Directors of Studies and Supervisors, who discuss with students ways of managing the demands imposed by their course.The ability to work with other people is fostered in Faculty discussion groups, classes and seminars, in supervisions where students are taught together, and in College groups of Philosophy students. Once again, responsibility for developing these skills is shared between the Faculty and the Colleges.Philosophy undergraduates are encouraged to learn some research skills. The Faculty Librarian and College Librarians are available to show them how to use basic library resources (books and IT), and Directors of Studies and Supervisors give them advice about how to search for information on particular topics. Students who write dissertations are, in effect, supervised on a small piece of research in much the same fashion as M.Phil. students.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgeDo I need to have Philosophy A level to apply? Is it an advantage to have Philosophy A level? No, it is neither a requirement nor a particular advantage. You will need of course to show at interview that you have read some philosophy and have some sense of what you are applying for! But private reading is fine (and someone who has merely stuck to the A level treadmill probably won't impress).What about other A levels? Is there any combination that is particularly looked for? Again, no. Some philosophers are admitted with maths and sciences; some are admitted with all arts subjects; some with a mix. Since philosophy involves a lot of close critical thinking and logical argument, it probably helps to do at least some A levels which involve accurate thinking (but that could be maths or it could be a subject like history where evidence needs to be carefully weighed and assessed).What, then, should I read before interview? For some suggestions, look here. There are no particular books that an interviewer will expect you to have read; but you will need to show that you have read and thought about some philosophy (and preferably some philosophy in the broadly 'analytic' style of the books in list of the suggested reading, as that is what the Cambridge course focuses on).What happens in interview? Normally, you will have at least two interviews, one by an admissions tutor for the College you have applied to, the other(s) by philosophers more or less closely attached to that College. As far as the philosophy interview is concerned, you will probably be asked about what you have read (if you mention in your application form some particular book that aroused your interest, don't be surprised to have that followed up!). If the College sets a written test, then your answers might well form the basis of a mini-tutorial. You may also be offered a menu of familiar philosophical problems (like the 'free will problem', 'scepticism about the external world' etc.) and asked to pick one to discuss.What are the interviewers looking for? Not the 'right answer'! Don't be surprised if you find your interviewer coming up with objections to what you thought was a well-respected, widely accepted view, and challenging it. It isn't that he or she is eccentric or holds a daft position: they are just trying to see if you can think how to defend your position -- they are trying to see, in other words, how good you are at following an argument and responding to criticism. It is quite OK to confess to be stumped (interviewers are not trying to catch you out, and will be more impressed by someone who sees difficulties and realizes the complexity of philosophical issues than by someone who blusters or waffles).Is there a written test? What is in it? Most Colleges ask applicants to sit a written test set by the Faculty. This test is designed to evaluate thinking skills and lasts one hour. You can download an explanation of the nature of the test, including some sample questions here.How could I prepare for any logical questions? Look at the opening chapters of a very elementary text like Samuel Guttenplan, The Languages of Logic (Blackwell). It is not the case that you are expected to have any technical logical knowledge; but it can't but help to have encountered the idea of a 'valid' argument, etc. Books on 'informal logic' or 'critical reasoning' will also help (for general A level purposes too).What Colleges should I apply to? The number of applicants per place varies a fair bit from College to College (though there is also a 'pool' system which aims to even things out a bit). Because numbers are small, some of the differences are just statistical quirks, with the differences varying unpredictably from year to year. Still, there are reasons for some of the variations. For example, a particularly appealing picture of one College recently appeared on the front cover of the university prospectus featuring a friendly snow-man -- and applications for that college more than doubled! So it is really worth pausing to think: if you are tempted to apply to College X because it is particularly famous, or particularly beautiful, or has an exceptionally attractive prospectus entry, then maybe lots of other people will be swayed in the same way! Do some homework (e.g. try to contact people who have been to Cambridge from your school or sixth-form college in recent years) to find out about Colleges other than the two or three you have heard of.Is there an advantage in applying to Colleges with lecturers in the philosophy faculty as Directors of Studies? Not especially; a College might have its own College Teaching Officer in philosophy, or a philosopher attached to the Classics Faculty or to History and Philosophy of Science, or a philosopher who lectures in the Open University.Can I apply to combine philosophy with another subject? There are no dual honours degrees in Cambridge. But you can follow Part 1A or Part 1B in philosophy with Part II in another subject (and vice versa). However, a candidate should probably apply only for the subject he or she wishes to read first. This is because (1) many people who come up saying that they want to do X followed by Y often stay with X, or change to Z instead, and Colleges usually let them where the choice is realistic, and (2) if you apply for two subjects you may have to run the gauntlet of two College Directors of Studies, one or both of whom may suspect the candidate of lack of commitment to their subject.Do Colleges look disfavourably on deferred entry applications? No. But College admissions tutors like to hear about sensible and contentful plans for spending your planned gap year.Does Cambridge welcome mature student applicants? Yes. Though if you are more than two or three years over the normal age of application, then it is worth grativating towards one of the colleges that admits only mature students (Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish [women only], St. Edmunds and Wolfson), where there will be more support and a more congenial social life with other students who are similarly placed.If I get to Cambridge do I have to do formal logic? Yes. But the reality is nowhere near as scary (or as boring) as the prospect might seem to some!If I get to Cambridge, how hard will I have to work? Philosophy students, of course, don't have long laboratory hours; and they have the advantage that arguments and discussions can be continued in the pub! But don't come under any misapprehension. Like all Cambridge students, you'd have to work very hard. The terms are shorter than elsewhere and a lot more is packed in. But students survive and mostly enjoy their time immensely.At the end of it all, what jobs can philosophy graduates get? Many and various. The analytic skills that philosophy develops are much sought by the civil service, and by the financial and business worlds; they also provide a very good foundation for conversion courses in law, and other kinds of professional training. A small but not insignificant number get the bug and go on to graduate work.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgePhilosophers think about the nature of knowledge, consciousness, moral responsibility, the nature of reality, about what we should do and how we should live together. The Cambridge Philosophy BA prepares you to tackle these questions, and at the same time, to think clearly and argue well. The Cambridge Philosophy BA is a three year, single honours course. This means that over your time here you will study philosophy in great depth. You will not only learn about philosophy but how to do philosophy. Cambridge is a fantastic place to study philosophy. Our academic staff are  both world-class researchers and committed teachers. And while the Faculty bustles with talks, seminars, and workshops, it is also small enough to know everyone by name. While the degree will push and challenge you, you will find yourself in an environment that is friendly and supportive, and in which everyone is excited about philosophy.The research interests of our staff cover much of contemporary analytic philosophy and history of philosophy. There are logicians, working both in formal and philosophical logic. There are ethicists and political philosophers,  thinking about consent, justice, and feminist philosophy.There are metaphysicians, studying the nature of causation and reality. There are philosophers of mind, thinking about the nature of consciousness and the will. There are historians of philosophy covering anything from ancient philosophy, the Middle Ages, Kant, Wittgenstein, and the history of analytic philosophy.Correspondingly broad are the options you have during your studies. After your first year, in which you will get a solid grounding in some of the central areas of analytic philosophy and history of philosophy, you will have increasing freedom to explore your interests: from ethics and aesthetics, to ancient philosophy, formal logic, philosophy of science, or metaphysics.You will learn philosophy through different methods. Besides the famous Cambridge supervisions – one-on-one meetings to discuss an essay you will have prepared for that week – you will also attend lectures given by experts in their field, and you will hone your argumentative skills in discussion groups with your peers. And, of course, you will spend plenty of time in the library, too.Our student body is very active. There are many student-run philosophy societies. The Amoral Sciences Club, the undergraduate philosophy group, hosts a weekly talk given by either undergraduates and visiting speakers. The Immoral Science Club promotes women and non-binary students in philosophy. Students also have a say on all important decisions about the course; student representatives sit on Faculty Board and the student body is consulted through the Staff-Student Committee.Cambridge looks back on a rich philosophical history with many distinguished men and women philosophers. The Faculty is located on Sidgwick Avenue, named after moral philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who was one of the founders of utilitarianism (as well as a pioneer of women’s education). In the early 19th century, Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein made seminal contributions to the philosophy of logic and language. More recently, Elizabeth Anscombe (who both studied in Cambridge and then returned as a professor) and Bernard Williams made wide-ranging contributions to moral philosophy, the philosophy of action, and many other areas.If you are interested in applying, we encourage you to find out as much as you can about the subject and our course. You can find more information on our website. You are also very welcome to attend one of our Open Days. The next Cambridge Open Days are on 5 and 6 July 2018. In addition, the Faculty also runs an annual 6th Form conference for year 12 students.The research interests of the Faculty's current staff span modern analytic philosophy and its history.Dr Arif Ahmed (Gonville & Caius) works on rational choice, religion and Wittgenstein.Dr Angela Breitenbach (King’s) works on Kant, philosophy of science and aesthetics.Dr Tim Button (St John’s) works on metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics and philosophical logic.Dr Clare Chambers (Jesus) works on political philosophy.Dr Tom Dougherty (Trinity Hall) works on ethics and political philosophyProf Richard Holton (Peterhouse) works on moral psychology, ethics, philosophy of language and the philosophy of law.Prof Rae Langton (Newnham) works on moral and political philosophy, history of philosophy (especially Kant), metaphysics and feminist philosophy.Prof John Marenbon (Trinity) specializes in medieval philosophy.Prof Alex Oliver (Gonville & Caius) works on logic, metaphysics, and philosophy of mathematics.Prof Michael Potter (Fitzwilliam) works on philosophy of mathematics, philosophical logic, and history of analytical philosophy.Prof Huw Price (Trinity) works on pragmatism, philosophy of physics, metaphysics and philosophy of language.Dr Paulina Sliwa (Sidney Sussex) works on ethics, epistemology and their intersection. The Papers currently on offer are as described later in this booklet but the Faculty regularly reviews the structure of the Tripos and the content of the papers. There may be some differences by the time you arrive.The undergraduate course of study in philosophy at Cambridge is called the Philosophy Tripos.  It is divided into three parts: Part IA, Part IB and Part II. The majority of our students study philosophy for all three years of their undergraduate course, taking one part of the Tripos each year.Unlike many universities Cambridge does not offer joint honours degrees in which philosophy can be studied concurrently with another subject such as Mathematics or English. It is, however, possible to take each part of the Tripos separately, and thus to combine the study of philosophy at Cambridge with that of another subject. A student could, for example, study Part I English (which takes two years) and then do Part II Philosophy in the third year.Additional course costsPhilosophy of its nature does not generate large additional course costs. But of course there are sundry expenses involved in collecting materials for study and preparing and backing up of students' own work.This prospectus describes the course as it is at the time of printing. For more up to date information consult the website: http://www.cam.phil.ac.uk   Be aware in any case that the course is revised annually and may be different by the time current applicants come to study it.Part IA of the Tripos is an introduction to the study of Philosophy and is normally taken in the first year. It consists of metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy, logic, and some historically important texts in philosophy. The emphasis is on developing students' ability to articulate and defend their own treatment of philosophical issues.1. Metaphysics Metaphysics is at the foundation of virtually the whole of philosophy. This course examines a wide range of metaphysical topics of perennial interest. The first part of the syllabus asks about God and causation. Many students will have encountered arguments for and against the existence of God. These arguments will be discussed in detail and also the problem of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient benevolent God with the apparent existence of evil in the world. The primary question about causation is simply what it is for one thing to cause another. Your alarm clock may go off every morning just before sunrise; but it doesn’t cause the sun to rise. What is missing? The second part of the syllabus tackles the mind and minded beings, and includes questions about free will. Is anything we do ever up to us? Can we have any choice at all if everything we do is the inevitable result of things beyond our control, such as facts about the distant past and laws of nature? Then there is the mind-body problem: What is the relation between mental and physical phenomena? Finally, the question of personal identity asks about the metaphysical nature of minded beings: What does it take for us to persist through time? Can we swap bodies or brains or minds?2. Ethics and political philosophyThis paper introduces a selection of the main problems in philosophical ethics and political philosophy. Can we know what is morally right and wrong, or is there nothing to be known because, in making pronouncements on moral matters, people are merely expressing their own emotions? Do people ever act completely altruistically, or is there a selfish element in all motivation? If we can act purely for others, why should we do so when it would be inconvenient for our own projects? One influential ethical theory, utilitarianism, prescribes that we should act so as to maximize the net balance of happiness over suffering. It faces a variety of objections, and has taken many forms, often in response to objections. The course aims to provide an understanding of the main variants, and to provide the necessary tools for evaluating them. The course also looks at the concept of Equality of Opportunity, and aims to get new students thinking about issues directly relevant to them, such as ‘who should get into Cambridge?’ Finally, it introduces a central topic in political philosophy, namely the question of political obligation and authority. With what right does the state rule over us? What are the conditions in which we are obliged to obey one political authority or another?3. LogicThis paper introduces basic issues in the philosophy of logic and language as well as key ideas of formal logic. There is a complex interplay between these informal and formal elements of the course. The central notion is that of a valid argument (e.g. All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; so Socrates is mortal). Arguments can be constructed in English and in the various formal languages that the logician invents, and formalised arguments are supposed to tell us something about the corresponding English arguments. Hence we need to know what an argument is, what validity is, and why it is significant. Are all good arguments valid? Are all valid arguments good? Validity of English arguments is an imprecise and intuitive notion, but validity of arguments framed in a formal language can be, and in this course is, made precise. Students practice translating between English and various formal languages: this helps them understand modern philosophical writings, in which uses of this symbolism are common. They also study the notion of meaning, which is central to the philosophy of logic and to the philosophy of language; as well as the nature of the elements of which meaningful statements are made up, such as names, descriptions and quantifier phrases. An important topic, which bridges the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind, is the relation between the meanings of sentences and the beliefs, intentions and conventions of language users.  Finally, there is the alleged distinction between analytic and synthetic truths. Analytic truths seem to be true solely in virtue of their meaning (e.g. All bachelors are unmarried) unlike synthetic truths, which require the world to be a certain way (e.g. Most people die before the age of 80). How is this distinction related to two others, that between necessary and contingent truths and that between a priori and a posteriori truths? And are there any analytic truths anyway?4. Set textsThis paper offers an introduction to the study of the history of philosophy. You will be required to develop a detailed knowledge of the texts you study and of relevant aspects of their historical background. At the same time, you will be encouraged to exercise your own judgment on the interpretation of the texts and the arguments and other materials they contain. You may be asked to study texts such as Plato, Meno; or Descartes, Meditations on first philosophy; or Mill, On Liberty and The Subjection of Women. Currently students are asked to study two out of three set texts but remember that by the time you arrive in Cambridge these texts may have changed and they are only listed here as examples.Students normally take Part IB in their second year. Two papers — metaphysics and epistemology, and logic — are currently compulsory: they develop themes and issues introduced in Part IA and introduce further concepts that are essential to the understanding of much current philosophy. In addition, students choose two other subjects from a range covering topics in ethics, Greek and Roman philosophy (from the Faculty of Classics Tripos), early modern philosophy, philosophy of science, political philosophy, and experimental psychology.1. Metaphysics and epistemologyThis paper covers a range of central questions in metaphysics and epistemology, including mind-dependence, the nature of possibility and necessity, the nature and sources of knowledge, and the challenge of scepticism.2. LogicThis paper extends the study of both the formal and the philosophical components of logic that students began to study in the first year.  Topics covered include theories of meaning, truth, logical form, names and descriptions, and theories of logic.3. EthicsThis paper covers a wide range of issues in contemporary and historical moral philosophy, including helping and harming, early modern moral philosophy, and moral psychology and motivation.4. Greek and Roman philosophyThis paper aims to introduce the variety and scope of ancient philosophy within its historical and cultural context. Students are introduced to a wide range of ancient texts from the pre-Socratics, through Plato and Aristotle, to Hellenistic and Roman philosophy. This paper is offered from Part IB of the Classical Tripos.5. Early modern philosophyThis paper aims to provide an opportunity to study some of the central problems of early modern philosophy, approached through the works of central authors such as Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley and Hume. It examines the way these problems developed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and considers how some of the greatest philosophers of the period proposed to solve them. At the same time, it offers an opportunity to study key philosophical texts in depth. These aims are reflected in the examination, which includes both questions about individual philosophers and broader, comparative questions.6. Philosophy of science This paper examines the nature and confirmation of scientific method, the nature of explanation in the various sciences, the status and character of laws of nature, and philosophical problems generated by the theory of probability. It also introduces the students to some of the central issues in the philosophy of physics.7. Political philosophy This paper examines a set of central issues in contemporary political philosophy and can work as an introduction to the subject. It is focused on the analysis of central political values, such as equality and liberty; and on the nature and justification of democracy.8. Experimental psychology This paper covers human experimental psychology, human learning and memory, neuropsychology, intelligence, developmental psychology, reasoning, emotion, and abnormal psychology. It involves practical work in the Psychological Laboratory. A scientific GCE A level or equivalent is not a prerequisite but may be an advantage for some of the material taught in the course. This paper is offered from Part IB of the Natural Sciences Tripos.This part of the Tripos is normally taken in a student’s third year at Cambridge. There are no compulsory subject papers. Instead there is a wide range of options, some providing a more extended and sophisticated treatment of themes introduced in Parts IA and IB, others (such as Aesthetics) covering new areas. The papers currently taught are as follows:1. MetaphysicsThis paper continues the study of metaphysics and the nature of mind, including such topics as realism and idealism, the nature of properties, the abstract and the concrete, the nature and direction of time and of causation, and the nature of personhood.2. Philosophy of mindThis paper focuses on a range of questions in the contemporary philosophy of mind. Topics studied include what the mind is and how it works; how one knows about the mind (either one’s own or others’); the nature of consciousness and intentionality, and the nature of the will, emotion and imagination.3. EthicsThis paper provides an opportunity to study a wide range of issues in contemporary and historical moral philosophy, including questions of ethical realism, irrealism, expressivism and constructivism; the nature of well-being; Kant’s Ethics and Kantian Ethics; and topics in moral psychology such as trust, the ethics of knowing and responsibility.4. European philosophy from KantThis paper covers the central movements of nineteenth century European philosophy, beginning with Kant and currently continuing through Hegel to Nietzsche. The course is a background to any engagement with later movements in European thought.5. Philosophy in the Long Middle Ages This paper covers philosophy in the period from c.400 to c. 1700, in the Latin, Arabic and Hebrew traditions. The texts of some of the most significant philosophers in this period are studied in translation, focusing on core topics in epistemology and metaphysics (in 2015-16: Universals, and Scientific Truth and Revelation).6. Philosophy of ScienceThis paper offers targeted study of the philosophies of the various sciences, including physics, biology and the social sciences. There is also the opportunity to study one general topic in the philosophy of science (in 2015-16: Philosophy of Cognitive Science).7. Mathematical logic The modern philosophy of mathematics has been shaped by technical results in mathematical logic, such as Gödel's incompleteness theorems and the Church-Turing undecidability theorem, which demonstrate the limitations of certain sorts of formal treatment of mathematics. This paper gives students a chance to study these technical results in detail and reflect on their philosophical significance. Some background in mathematics (e.g. A-level mathematics or equivalent) is advisable.8. Philosophical logic This paper includes advanced topics in logic and the philosophy of language such as truth and meaning; conditionals; and plurals. The paper also includes advanced topics in the philosophy of mathematics, including theories about the nature of logic and mathematics.9. WittgensteinLudwig Wittgenstein was one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. The paper focuses on his two central works, the Tractatus and Philosophical Investigations, as well as On Certainty, which he was working on just before his death. The interpretation of Wittgenstein's works has proved controversial, and the course provides an introduction to exegetical cruces in all the texts specified, as well as experience in relating those issues to ones in contemporary philosophy of mind and language.10. Political philosophy This paper examines a range of advanced topics in political philosophy, including global political issues such as immigration and international justice; multiculturalism and community; feminism; and radical political theory.11. Aesthetics This paper deals with central questions that arise in connection with the study of art and beauty, such as the nature of artistic representation and expression, the nature and value of art and aesthetic experience; the connection between art and morality; and the nature of aesthetic interpretation.PAPERS FROM PART II OF THE CLASSICAL TRIPOS THAT MAY BE TAKEN IN PART IIA candidate for Part II of the Philosophy Tripos may take one or two of the following papers:Group B (Ancient Philosophy)B1. Plato (2015–2016)These lectures will address issues in Plato’s logic, epistemology and metaphysics by exploring various dialogues including the Parmenides, the Euthydemus, the Cratylus, the Theaeteus, and the Sophist. Central themes will include the nature of language and dialectic, the possibility of falsehood, and the existence of Forms. Use the OCT for the Greek text; good translations of all the dialogues are available in the one volume edition of J. Cooper, Plato, Complete Works (Hackett 1997).B2. Aristotle’s world, from turtles to tragedies (2015–2016)Aristotle is invoked by thinkers as diverse as political theorists seeking communitarian alternatives to liberal individualism, and moral philosophers seeking to replace legalistic Kantianism with anything from moral particularism to virtue ethics. For Aristotle, however, his moral and political thought formed one continuous series of reflections. This course examines the whole of that thought, as presented in the Politics and the Nicomachean Ethics.The lectures for this course are intended to be accessible to all students, classicists and others, regardless of their knowledge of Greek.B3. A prescribed subject or period in Greek and Roman philosophyIn 2015–2016: ‘Reason and reasoning’Greeks loved reasoning, for advancing practical ends (like doing down a rival in a lawcourt), for achieving theoretical enlightenment (like demonstrating a geometrical theorem beyond all cavil), and sometimes for sheer entertainment (like the agons in tragedy, or contests between rival sophists). Greeks also liked to theorise about reasoning: by no means the strangest example is Plato’s doctrine of the Philosopher Kings, that people are qualified to share in government only if they have extremely well-developed powers of abstract reasoning.PAPER FROM PART IIB OF THE THEOLOGICAL AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES TRIPOS THAT MAY BE TAKEN IN PART IIA candidate for Part II of the Philosophy Tripos may also take Paper C11, Metaphysics, from Part IIB of the Theological and Religious Studies Tripos. This paper is designed to provide third year undergraduates with a systematic understanding of the contemporary problems of religious metaphysics, and to enable them to argue rationally and convincingly between alternative positions, both religious and anti-religious.Students will be asked to contact the Faculty of Divinity for further details. Responsibility for the teaching of philosophy at Cambridge is divided between the Faculty of Philosophy and the individual colleges. The Faculty organizes lectures, logic classes, discussion groups and seminars. The Director of Studies at each individual college organizes tutorials (known in Cambridge as supervisions) for its students. This division of responsibility contributes to the diversity of philosophy teaching at Cambridge, since it allows the Director of Studies to tailor each student's teaching to his or her own abilities and needs.LecturesIn the first two years of the course the lectures organised by the Faculty introduce students to the concepts and arguments characteristic of philosophical debates. At Part II level, some lectures are more advanced, and lecturers may take the opportunity to develop new positions rather than just explore the existing state of the debate.Although the lectures are designed to provide adequate coverage of the content of each part of the course, they do not define the content of the course or any part of it. Students are free to approach the topics they study in their own way; equally, lecturers are not constrained by the need to cover all the topics of a paper in their lectures.It is a general principle of Cambridge University that its lectures are open to all members of the University. This is especially useful for philosophy students because philosophical arguments have an important place in several academic disciplines and so there may be lectures relevant to philosophers in various departments of the University other than the Faculty of Philosophy – Classics, History, Divinity, Human, Social and Political Science, and History and Philosophy of Science. It is normal practice, therefore, for philosophy students to attend lectures organised by these departments.Discussion groups and classesThe Faculty organises logic classes for first year students, and discussion groups for first and second year students. The latter provide an opportunity for students from different colleges to meet each other and compare and develop their responses to philosophical issues. The teaching for advanced Part II courses sometimes takes the form of seminar discussions rather than lectures, and can in some cases be open both to graduates and undergraduate students.SupervisionsAll students have a Director of Studies appointed by their college to oversee their work, give advice on the choice of papers and arrange supervisions. Most Directors of Studies will do some supervisions themselves; but philosophy students will have several different supervisors during their Cambridge careers, possibly including other Faculty teaching officers and advanced postgraduate students.Philosophy students can expect to have one supervision each week. Probably the most distinctive feature of reading philosophy at Cambridge is that supervisions are usually one-to-one. The supervisor will set an essay on a topic covered by the syllabus and recommend relevant reading. The student will then hand in the essay prior to the supervision so that the supervisor can read and comment on it in advance. The supervision itself is then devoted to a critical discussion of the essay topic.MeetingsThe Moral Sciences Club is the University's main philosophical society. (Its name reflects the fact that until 1973 the Cambridge philosophy course was called the Moral Sciences Tripos.) It meets every Tuesday at 2 p.m. during term to hear and discuss talks normally given by visiting philosophers. All members of the Faculty, from first year undergraduates to professors, are welcome to join.The Amoral Sciences Club is run by undergraduates and puts on an alternative series of philosophy talks.The Immoral Sciences Club is run by undergraduates and provides support and collaboration for women and non-binary people studying philosophy.Once a year the Faculty invites an eminent philosopher to give an Open Lecture, currently sponsored by Routledge Publishers. Recent lecturers include Amartya Sen, the late Sir Michael Dummett, the late Sir Bernard Williams, Professor Jerry Fodor, Professor Ronald Dworkin, Professor Thomas Pogge, Professor Richard Moran, Professor Philip Pettit, Professor David Luban, Professor Susan Wolf, Professor Michael Bratman, Professor Judith Jarvis Thomson and Professor Peter Singer. Professor Peter Singer, who gave the Routledge Lecture in 2017(photo by Barbara Oehring) There are examinations for each part of the philosophy course in late May/early June, in the second half of the Easter (third) term. Part IA students sit one three-hour examination for each of their four subjects, in which they normally have to answer three essay-type questions. In addition they sit a fifth paper in which they write one longer essay over three hours. The aim of this General Paper is to encourage students to reflect on broader issues than arise in the context of the subject papers, and to reward originality and flexibility as much as knowledge of specific areas of the subject.Part IB students may if they wish replace one of their written exam papers with two extended essays written in their own time earlier in the year on appropriate topics. Part II students also have this option, and they also may submit one longer dissertation in place of another written exam paper: this can be on any philosophical topic of the student's choosing that the Faculty is able to teach and examine.Each part of the Tripos is marked separately and independently. There is no overall mark/class for all 3 years of study.The Faculty aims to detach undergraduate teaching, and especially supervisions, from the examination process. We encourage students to work through difficult points throughout the year with no fear that any misunderstandings will be counted against their final marks. LibrariesThe Casimir Lewy Library is the primary source of printed and electronic material needed for the study and teaching of philosophy in Cambridge. It covers all the areas taught in the Philosophy Tripos as well as most of the areas researched by graduates and teaching staff. The library stock, therefore, extends well beyond philosophy itself to cover the interdisciplinary subjects related to philosophy taught and researched in the University.The Casimir Lewy LibraryThe University Library, as one of Britain's five copyright libraries, holds every academically important book published in Britain since the early eighteenth century, as well as extensive stocks from overseas.The Classics, Divinity, History, and History and Philosophy of Science libraries also contain much material useful to philosophy students, as do college libraries.Language LearningVarious courses in languages useful to philosophers are open to students and the University Language Centre is open to all students.ComputingAll students are encouraged to use University Public Workstation Facilities (PWF) which are located in many sites around the University. Most of the computers in the Faculty Library are part of the Raised Faculty Building PWF. This service gives access to a number of electronic resources and word processing. Wireless networking is available in most areas of the Faculty.E-mail is the normal method of communication between students and the Faculty's staff.All colleges also provide computing facilities for their students. Many give access to electronic resources via wifi or ethernet sockets installed in students' study bedrooms. Disabled StudentsColleges judge applications from students with physical disabilities on the same academic terms as those from other candidates. However, they find it helpful to know in advance about the degree of a candidate's disability or impairment, so that they can offer advice on the suitability of their facilities. Prospective candidates with questions about the Faculty's own facilities should contact the Faculty Office.Information on the University's Disability Resource Centre can be found at:  www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/disability/ Deciding to read philosophy at Cambridge does not commit you to a narrow range of careers. Our recent graduates include an RAF test pilot as well as IT consultants, management consultants, fund-raisers, civil servants, lawyers, arts administrators and teachers. In addition, many of our students choose to carry on with further study towards graduate degrees such as the M.Phil and Ph.D in philosophy. For some of them philosophy will become their career: the last time we tried to count, there were 58 people holding senior posts in philosophy departments around the world who started their philosophical careers by reading for a degree in the Cambridge Philosophy Faculty. Undergraduate admissions are handled by individual colleges and not by the Faculty of Philosophy.

A philosopher will ask you what the nature of truth is, what you think beauty is, and even what it means to say that one thing is identical to another. As a student of philosophy you’ll often be asked by the uninitiated, ‘what IS philosophy?’; and even after three years you may struggle to answer. Philosophy is defined more by its methods than by the topics which it covers, taking an in-depth and critical view on fundamental questions about the universe and our functioning within it. The questions may be about time, morality, justice, possibility, even the nature of philosophy itself.Philosophy is hard work. There are always more books to get through, and philosophers are not renowned for their reader-friendly prose! But when you do get through your weekly reading or finally understand that argument you never really got before, it can be hugely rewarding. And Cambridge is a great place to study this exciting and challenging discipline. Even in first year, your lecturers will rarely just talk through the reading list. Instead they will use lectures as an opportunity to investigate genuinely original ideas and discuss new ways of looking at old problems.There are usually around 50 students in each year. Most people will not have had the chance to study Philosophy at school, and students come to Philosophy from all possible combinations of A-levels.Supervisions are a big part of what makes philosophy at Cambridge unique. Each week you will receive feedback on an essay you have prepared, and engage in real, in-depth, philosophical discussion. While this may seem daunting at first, you soon realise how valuable it is. Getting the chance to discuss your ideas one on one with your supervisor (who may well have written the foremost book on your topic) allows you not only to develop your ideas but also to gain experience in defending your point of view and learning to anticipate objections.Logic is central to the course at Cambridge, and is a compulsory paper for the first two years. This will be different from anything you’ll have studied at school, but is one of the most rewarding parts of the syllabus, providing you with a critical eye which will help you grapple with any area in philosophy. Despite what you might think, having done Maths A-Level is by no means a prerequisite for finding this part of the course fulfilling.In your second and third years you have the option to take papers from other faculties, such as Divinity, Classics and Psychology, which gives you a chance to gain a new perspective and learn a different way of thinking about and tackling problems. Philosophy in Cambridge also extends beyond the lecture room and the library, with philosophical societies from the prestigious Moral Sciences Club to the more casual Amoral Sciences Club or Women in Philosophy Society. More often than not, a fascinating supervision discussion or a really great lecture will feed conversations with other students. Many a philosophical epiphany is had over coffee in the Sidgwick Site cafe. Studying philosophy at Cambridge, you will learn how to argue, think critically and examine ideas, and gain skills that will be useful in any future career. The course is for anyone who loves to analyse in rigorous detail how arguments fit together or fail, who questions everything, and who wants to learn more about the field.Ellen Judson, Trinity HallMatthew van der Merwe, Gonville and Caius The University reserves the right in every case, at its discretion and for any reason, to make changes in regulations, syllabuses and fees without prior notice, and to alter or not to offer degree programmes or parts of degree programmes.

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge The claim that violently misogynistic pornography (abuse porn) causes gender-based violence (GBV) is controversial and notoriously resistant to empirical confirmation or disconfirmation. In this talk, I begin with the more generally accepted claim that GBV exists—and is a big problem—and ask: How does the existence of abuse porn—and its spillover into mainstream entertainment—affect those who have been victims of GBV and those who, at least some of the time, live in fear of it? I argue that the prevalence of abuse porn further victimizes survivors of GBV by subjecting them to testimonial and hermeneutical injustice.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge Maybe the most important argument in David Chalmers's monumental book Constructing the World is the one he calls the `Frontloading Argument'. It is one of two arguments used in Chapter 4 to argue for the central thesis of the book, A Priori Scrutability. And, at first blush, the Frontloading Argument looks very strong. I shall be arguing here, however, that it is incapable of securing the conclusion it is meant to establish. The argument requires subsidiary premises that are not only sufficient by themselves to establish A Priori Scrutability but are arguably far stronger.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge "Is beauty a property of an object or merely in the eye of the beholder? In ontology of aesthetic properties, subjectivist non-realism has been the dominant view. Against this trend, I advance a novel realist position, which conceives of aesthetic properties as powers; I draw on recent dispositionalist accounts of powers to flesh out my claim. I show how such realism about aesthetic powers solves two puzzles in aesthetics, and I explain how the case of aesthetic properties is different from the case of colours. Though the resulting position might seem counter-intuitive, I claim it in fact captures the contemporary art critical Zeitgeist, which is more concerned with powers objects have over potential spectators, and less with the beholder herself.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge The Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club is devoted to the publication and discussion of philosophical papers. But such a bare description does not suffice. If as Wittgenstein believed philosophy is a vice or disease of the mind, then Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club is a high-class brothel or leper colony, where the degenerate or afflicted may fraternise in a tasteful and secluded environment. Or it is a greenhouse or other horticultural receptacle in which was nurtured the intellectual flower of the early twentieth-century East Anglia: among others, Keynes, Russell, Ramsey, Wittgenstein and Moore. In short, this ancient institution has played a major role in the history of analytical philosophy, and continues to do so today. What were its origins?There are records of a Moral Sciences Club having been founded in 1874. But that Club lapsed within two years, and the first meeting of the modern Club took place on Saturday 19 October 1878. On that day Alfred Caldecott, a third year Moral Sciences undergraduate at St John's, presided over and hosted a meeting in which the Club's constitution was agreed. Present at the meeting were Caldecott, seven other undergraduates of St John's and two of Trinity. Among them were Joseph Jacobs, a friend of George Eliot's, and Alfred Mummery, soon to be appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at King's College London-a post in which he was succeeded by Caldecott. It was decided at this meeting that the Club would be open only to those who were reading for or had taken a degree in Moral Sciences.The first meeting of the Club at which a paper was given, took place in the rooms of T.E. Scrutton, Trinity, at 9pm on Saturday 26 October. The paper, by Caldecott, was "Development Theories of Conscience". About thirty students attended. The attendance is pretty much the same today as is the tone of the Club's minutes. For example, in1880 we find the following minute (by G.E. Humphreys, Caius) :After the minutes of the last meeting had been read (by Mr Frost in the absence of the Secretary) and approved, there was a long and unusual break in the continuity of the proceedings from the fact that the reader of the paper did not make his appearance until 5 minutes to 10 o'clock. The excuse given was that having retired to the Gog hills to meditate upon some unusually obscure Hegelianisms he had become so lost in thought that it was only when curfew broke in upon the current of his reflections that he remembered he was still a being belonging to this world, to Cambridge and to the Moral Science Club. With this preface Mr Rees proceeded to read his paper on "The Philosophy of History."It is a measure of the decline in Hegel's influence at Cambridge that speakers nowadays are almost never late. (I am indebted to J. Pitt's article in Russell, Winter 1982).So much for the Club's origins. What about its importance? The emergence of analytical philosophy marked a break with post-Kantian metaphysics as the latter had evolved both in England and in Continental Europe. It offered a new conception of philosophical problems and suggested new ways to solve them. If Bolzano was the St John the Baptist of this movement and Frege its Jesus Christ, then Russell was its St Paul, Cambridge his Damascus, and what is now the M11 his road thereto. In this typology the Moral Sciences Club corresponds to an early church, say that of Antioch, instrumental in the introduction and dissemination of the new doctrines. This was manifested in two ways.The concentration of great philosophers at Cambridge made the Club the forum at which a number of seminal papers received their first airing. One of the founding documents of analytical philosophy, Moore's "Nature of Judgment", was given on 21 October 1898. "Knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description" appeared in 1911 and what became Ramsey's "Truth and Probability" in 1926. Russell's "Limits of Empiricism" was given in Michaelmas 1935; Moore's Paradox appeared in Michaelmas 1944.The Club also disseminates as well as introduces new ideas. The publication of papers does not render a discussion group redundant in this process even if it can only involve a small number of people and only for the course of an evening. We must not overlook the importance of personal intercourse in the spread of ideas. Regrettably often a doctrine is widely accepted less because of its truth than because of the personality of its author. For if a philosopher writes a book he may gain followers; if he gives a talk he is liable to find evangelists.The case of Wittgenstein illustrates this point. It also illustrates the influence of the Club itself. Wittgenstein gave his first paper to the Club in Michaelmas 1912. He and Moore had persuaded the Club to appoint a Chairman to prevent futile discussions and to change the rules so as to limit the duration of talks to seven minutes. Wittgenstein's contribution came on 29 November (the Club's meetings had moved to Fridays to avoid clashing with the Apostles); the minutes are as follows:Mr Wittgenstein read a paper entitled "What is Philosophy?" The paper lasted only about 4 minutes, thus cutting the previous record established by Mr Tye by nearly two minutes. Philosophy was defined as all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences. This defn. was much discussed, but there was no general disposition to adopt it. The discussion kept very much to the point, and the Chairman did not find it necessary to intervene much.As far as I know Wittgenstein's record still stands, and it is unlikely that it will ever be beaten, now that the 7-minute restriction has been replaced by a 30-minute one – which many speakers moreover treat more as a minimum than a maximum. Perhaps the Club should institute a Prize for the shortest talk of the year.Wittgenstein's return to Cambridge in 1929 inaugurated his domination of Cambridge philosophy and in particular of the Moral Sciences Club. For example Broad once remarked, in explanation of his non-attendance, that "he was not prepared to spend hours every week in a thick atmosphere of cigarette-smoke, while Wittgenstein punctually went through his hoops and the faithful as punctually 'wondered with a foolish look of praise.'" It was in response to this that Broad introduced the rule-which still exists though its principal target has been dead for fifty years-that a speaker may request the 'starring' of a meeting (meaning that only junior Members are permitted to attend it).After Moore resigned the Chairmanship in 1944 on grounds of ill-health, Wittgenstein took over. By this time, I conjecture, the Club had become his conduit in two ways. First, it was obviously a medium for his own philosophical ideas. But secondly, public debate gave him the opportunity to air-and to infect others with-his contempt for other living philosophers, to their face. And Ryle said that at meetings of the Club, "veneration for Wittgenstein was so incontinent that mentions, for example, my mentions, of any other philosopher were greeted with jeers... Wittgenstein gave the impression, first that he himself was proud not to have studied other philosophers... and second, that he thought that people who did study them were academic and therefore unauthentic philosophers."No account of the Club would be complete without a brief description of the most notorious meeting of all (possibly excepting I Hacking's lively 1998 summary of knitwear production techniques in British Columbia). This was the poker-involving confrontation between Wittgenstein and Popper at a meeting of the Club on 26 October 1946 at which Popper read a paper entitled "Are there Philosophical Problems?".Opinion is divided over exactly what happened at that meeting. Some say that Popper and Wittgenstein, having lashed one another into a philosophical frenzy, came to blows, each armed with a poker. Popper himself states in his autobiography that Wittgenstein brandished a poker at Popper, demanding an example of a moral rule, to which Popper replied: "Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers", whereupon Wittgenstein is said to have thrown down the poker and stormed out of the room. Others say that it was Russell who made this amusing remark. Consistent with all of these views was the opinion of the Secretary, W. Hijab (Trinity), who says in his minute that the meeting "was charged to an unusual degree with the spirit of controversy". (The occasion is the subject of a best-selling recent book, Wittgenstein's Poker)The Club has flourished from that day to this. Practically every major philosopher since the War has spoken here at one time or another. Recent years have seen a number of famous visitors (e.g. A. Gibbard, F. Jackson, D. Lewis, C. Wright, T. Williamson) and a broad range of subjects. On one occasion in the present writer's memory, a speaker continued delivering his paper over a fire alarm. It indicates the dedication of both him and his audience that one and all scorned to leave the room, prepared to risk incineration rather than miss the speaker's insights into possible worlds. On another occasion, the meeting ended early because the speaker gave up in the middle of the question period after somebody had made a decisive point against him. Would that all philosophers were so honest!The Club has moved around Cambridge too. For many years until 1998 it was installed in Clare under the amiable guidance of Professor Smiley. After that it moved to Darwin and then to St John's. Every year there the Club changes its Secretary. As has been customary ever since its foundation, the Secretary is drawn from the student body. A number of previous secretaries have gone on to careers in philosophy.Hijab spoke of the "spirit of controversy". The visitor to the Club will find that spirit alive and well; as there is no fireplace in the Dirac Room, he may in addition be assured that the risk of physical injury is nowadays fairly low.Arif AhmedOnora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

As usual the talk will be followed by further discussion over dinner.Location: Sidgwick Hall, Newnham CollegeGay Meek 'The Fall and Rise of the Philosophy of Economics'Location: Sidgwick Hall, Newnham College Sophia Connell 'Mothers and intelligence in Aristotle's biology and ethics'Location: Sidgwick Hall, Newnham CollegeLubomira Radoilska 'Self-effacement and Autonomy'Location: TBA Pamela Sue Anderson 'Epistemic injustice' in feminist Philosophy of Religion       Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgePost TriposAs a Cambridge undergraduate/graduate you can use the Cambridge University Careers Service as often as you like.Deciding to read philosophy at Cambridge does not commit you to a narrow range of careers. Our graduates include an RAF test pilot as well as IT consultants, management consultants, fund-raisers, civil servants, lawyers, arts administrators and teachers.Many of our students choose to carry on with further study towards graduate degrees such as the  M.Phil. and Ph.D. in philosophy. For some of them philosophy will become their career; the last time we tried to count, there were 58 people holding senior posts in philosophy departments around the world who started their philosophical careers by reading for the Cambridge Philosophy Tripos.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge The Philosophy Tripos enables students to develop the following transferable skills:These skills are all central to the study of Philosophy. Responsibility for fostering them is divided between the Faculty and the Colleges. They are developed in lectures, classes, discussion groups, seminars, supervisions and examinations.Writing skills are practised in weekly essays, submitted essays and dissertations. Since it is principally supervisors who help students to improve their writing, this aspect of their development is primarily the responsibility of Directors of Studies.Responsibility for the development of oral skills falls both to the Faculty, which organises discussion groups and seminars in which students debate philosophical issues, and to Directors of Studies, who arrange supervisions for students and in some cases run College seminars.Since philosophy students are mainly supervised individually or in pairs, they have plenty of opportunity to develop their oral skills through philosophical discussion. Within the University there are also societies and reading groups where students can refine their oral skills.Philosophy students are, from the beginning of their course, encouraged to work independently and to explore problems on their own initiative. Lecturers and supervisors encourage these skills by providing bibliographies, and referring to articles or books which students may then go and read. An independent approach is also fostered by the fact that students are free to attend any lectures given for the Philosophy Tripos (and indeed any lectures given in the University). Furthermore, submitted essays and Part II dissertations require students to make informed choices and enable them to follow up their own interests.The task of developing an ability to use time productively falls mainly to Directors of Studies and Supervisors, who discuss with students ways of managing the demands imposed by their course.The ability to work with other people is fostered in Faculty discussion groups, classes and seminars, in supervisions where students are taught together, and in College groups of Philosophy students. Once again, responsibility for developing these skills is shared between the Faculty and the Colleges.Philosophy undergraduates are encouraged to learn some research skills. The Faculty Librarian and College Librarians are available to show them how to use basic library resources (books and IT), and Directors of Studies and Supervisors give them advice about how to search for information on particular topics. Students who write dissertations are, in effect, supervised on a small piece of research in much the same fashion as M.Phil. students.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgeDo I need to have Philosophy A level to apply? Is it an advantage to have Philosophy A level? No, it is neither a requirement nor a particular advantage. You will need of course to show at interview that you have read some philosophy and have some sense of what you are applying for! But private reading is fine (and someone who has merely stuck to the A level treadmill probably won't impress).What about other A levels? Is there any combination that is particularly looked for? Again, no. Some philosophers are admitted with maths and sciences; some are admitted with all arts subjects; some with a mix. Since philosophy involves a lot of close critical thinking and logical argument, it probably helps to do at least some A levels which involve accurate thinking (but that could be maths or it could be a subject like history where evidence needs to be carefully weighed and assessed).What, then, should I read before interview? For some suggestions, look here. There are no particular books that an interviewer will expect you to have read; but you will need to show that you have read and thought about some philosophy (and preferably some philosophy in the broadly 'analytic' style of the books in list of the suggested reading, as that is what the Cambridge course focuses on).What happens in interview? Normally, you will have at least two interviews, one by an admissions tutor for the College you have applied to, the other(s) by philosophers more or less closely attached to that College. As far as the philosophy interview is concerned, you will probably be asked about what you have read (if you mention in your application form some particular book that aroused your interest, don't be surprised to have that followed up!). If the College sets a written test, then your answers might well form the basis of a mini-tutorial. You may also be offered a menu of familiar philosophical problems (like the 'free will problem', 'scepticism about the external world' etc.) and asked to pick one to discuss.What are the interviewers looking for? Not the 'right answer'! Don't be surprised if you find your interviewer coming up with objections to what you thought was a well-respected, widely accepted view, and challenging it. It isn't that he or she is eccentric or holds a daft position: they are just trying to see if you can think how to defend your position -- they are trying to see, in other words, how good you are at following an argument and responding to criticism. It is quite OK to confess to be stumped (interviewers are not trying to catch you out, and will be more impressed by someone who sees difficulties and realizes the complexity of philosophical issues than by someone who blusters or waffles).Is there a written test? What is in it? Most Colleges ask applicants to sit a written test set by the Faculty. This test is designed to evaluate thinking skills and lasts one hour. You can download an explanation of the nature of the test, including some sample questions here.How could I prepare for any logical questions? Look at the opening chapters of a very elementary text like Samuel Guttenplan, The Languages of Logic (Blackwell). It is not the case that you are expected to have any technical logical knowledge; but it can't but help to have encountered the idea of a 'valid' argument, etc. Books on 'informal logic' or 'critical reasoning' will also help (for general A level purposes too).What Colleges should I apply to? The number of applicants per place varies a fair bit from College to College (though there is also a 'pool' system which aims to even things out a bit). Because numbers are small, some of the differences are just statistical quirks, with the differences varying unpredictably from year to year. Still, there are reasons for some of the variations. For example, a particularly appealing picture of one College recently appeared on the front cover of the university prospectus featuring a friendly snow-man -- and applications for that college more than doubled! So it is really worth pausing to think: if you are tempted to apply to College X because it is particularly famous, or particularly beautiful, or has an exceptionally attractive prospectus entry, then maybe lots of other people will be swayed in the same way! Do some homework (e.g. try to contact people who have been to Cambridge from your school or sixth-form college in recent years) to find out about Colleges other than the two or three you have heard of.Is there an advantage in applying to Colleges with lecturers in the philosophy faculty as Directors of Studies? Not especially; a College might have its own College Teaching Officer in philosophy, or a philosopher attached to the Classics Faculty or to History and Philosophy of Science, or a philosopher who lectures in the Open University.Can I apply to combine philosophy with another subject? There are no dual honours degrees in Cambridge. But you can follow Part 1A or Part 1B in philosophy with Part II in another subject (and vice versa). However, a candidate should probably apply only for the subject he or she wishes to read first. This is because (1) many people who come up saying that they want to do X followed by Y often stay with X, or change to Z instead, and Colleges usually let them where the choice is realistic, and (2) if you apply for two subjects you may have to run the gauntlet of two College Directors of Studies, one or both of whom may suspect the candidate of lack of commitment to their subject.Do Colleges look disfavourably on deferred entry applications? No. But College admissions tutors like to hear about sensible and contentful plans for spending your planned gap year.Does Cambridge welcome mature student applicants? Yes. Though if you are more than two or three years over the normal age of application, then it is worth grativating towards one of the colleges that admits only mature students (Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish [women only], St. Edmunds and Wolfson), where there will be more support and a more congenial social life with other students who are similarly placed.If I get to Cambridge do I have to do formal logic? Yes. But the reality is nowhere near as scary (or as boring) as the prospect might seem to some!If I get to Cambridge, how hard will I have to work? Philosophy students, of course, don't have long laboratory hours; and they have the advantage that arguments and discussions can be continued in the pub! But don't come under any misapprehension. Like all Cambridge students, you'd have to work very hard. The terms are shorter than elsewhere and a lot more is packed in. But students survive and mostly enjoy their time immensely.At the end of it all, what jobs can philosophy graduates get? Many and various. The analytic skills that philosophy develops are much sought by the civil service, and by the financial and business worlds; they also provide a very good foundation for conversion courses in law, and other kinds of professional training. A small but not insignificant number get the bug and go on to graduate work.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at CambridgePhilosophers think about the nature of knowledge, consciousness, moral responsibility, the nature of reality, about what we should do and how we should live together. The Cambridge Philosophy BA prepares you to tackle these questions, and at the same time, to think clearly and argue well. The Cambridge Philosophy BA is a three year, single honours course. This means that over your time here you will study philosophy in great depth. You will not only learn about philosophy but how to do philosophy. Cambridge is a fantastic place to study philosophy. Our academic staff are  both world-class researchers and committed teachers. And while the Faculty bustles with talks, seminars, and workshops, it is also small enough to know everyone by name. While the degree will push and challenge you, you will find yourself in an environment that is friendly and supportive, and in which everyone is excited about philosophy.The research interests of our staff cover much of contemporary analytic philosophy and history of philosophy. There are logicians, working both in formal and philosophical logic. There are ethicists and political philosophers,  thinking about consent, justice, and feminist philosophy.There are metaphysicians, studying the nature of causation and reality. There are philosophers of mind, thinking about the nature of consciousness and the will. There are historians of philosophy covering anything from ancient philosophy, the Middle Ages, Kant, Wittgenstein, and the history of analytic philosophy.Correspondingly broad are the options you have during your studies. After your first year, in which you will get a solid grounding in some of the central areas of analytic philosophy and history of philosophy, you will have increasing freedom to explore your interests: from ethics and aesthetics, to ancient philosophy, formal logic, philosophy of science, or metaphysics.You will learn philosophy through different methods. Besides the famous Cambridge supervisions – one-on-one meetings to discuss an essay you will have prepared for that week – you will also attend lectures given by experts in their field, and you will hone your argumentative skills in discussion groups with your peers. And, of course, you will spend plenty of time in the library, too.Our student body is very active. There are many student-run philosophy societies. The Amoral Sciences Club, the undergraduate philosophy group, hosts a weekly talk given by either undergraduates and visiting speakers. The Immoral Science Club promotes women and non-binary students in philosophy. Students also have a say on all important decisions about the course; student representatives sit on Faculty Board and the student body is consulted through the Staff-Student Committee.Cambridge looks back on a rich philosophical history with many distinguished men and women philosophers. The Faculty is located on Sidgwick Avenue, named after moral philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who was one of the founders of utilitarianism (as well as a pioneer of women’s education). In the early 19th century, Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein made seminal contributions to the philosophy of logic and language. More recently, Elizabeth Anscombe (who both studied in Cambridge and then returned as a professor) and Bernard Williams made wide-ranging contributions to moral philosophy, the philosophy of action, and many other areas.If you are interested in applying, we encourage you to find out as much as you can about the subject and our course. You can find more information on our website. You are also very welcome to attend one of our Open Days. The next Cambridge Open Days are on 5 and 6 July 2018. In addition, the Faculty also runs an annual 6th Form conference for year 12 students.The research interests of the Faculty's current staff span modern analytic philosophy and its history.Dr Arif Ahmed (Gonville & Caius) works on rational choice, religion and Wittgenstein.Dr Angela Breitenbach (King’s) works on Kant, philosophy of science and aesthetics.Dr Tim Button (St John’s) works on metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics and philosophical logic.Dr Clare Chambers (Jesus) works on political philosophy.Dr Tom Dougherty (Trinity Hall) works on ethics and political philosophyProf Richard Holton (Peterhouse) works on moral psychology, ethics, philosophy of language and the philosophy of law.Prof Rae Langton (Newnham) works on moral and political philosophy, history of philosophy (especially Kant), metaphysics and feminist philosophy.Prof John Marenbon (Trinity) specializes in medieval philosophy.Prof Alex Oliver (Gonville & Caius) works on logic, metaphysics, and philosophy of mathematics.Prof Michael Potter (Fitzwilliam) works on philosophy of mathematics, philosophical logic, and history of analytical philosophy.Prof Huw Price (Trinity) works on pragmatism, philosophy of physics, metaphysics and philosophy of language.Dr Paulina Sliwa (Sidney Sussex) works on ethics, epistemology and their intersection. The Papers currently on offer are as described later in this booklet but the Faculty regularly reviews the structure of the Tripos and the content of the papers. There may be some differences by the time you arrive.The undergraduate course of study in philosophy at Cambridge is called the Philosophy Tripos.  It is divided into three parts: Part IA, Part IB and Part II. The majority of our students study philosophy for all three years of their undergraduate course, taking one part of the Tripos each year.Unlike many universities Cambridge does not offer joint honours degrees in which philosophy can be studied concurrently with another subject such as Mathematics or English. It is, however, possible to take each part of the Tripos separately, and thus to combine the study of philosophy at Cambridge with that of another subject. A student could, for example, study Part I English (which takes two years) and then do Part II Philosophy in the third year.Additional course costsPhilosophy of its nature does not generate large additional course costs. But of course there are sundry expenses involved in collecting materials for study and preparing and backing up of students' own work.This prospectus describes the course as it is at the time of printing. For more up to date information consult the website: http://www.cam.phil.ac.uk   Be aware in any case that the course is revised annually and may be different by the time current applicants come to study it.Part IA of the Tripos is an introduction to the study of Philosophy and is normally taken in the first year. It consists of metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy, logic, and some historically important texts in philosophy. The emphasis is on developing students' ability to articulate and defend their own treatment of philosophical issues.1. Metaphysics Metaphysics is at the foundation of virtually the whole of philosophy. This course examines a wide range of metaphysical topics of perennial interest. The first part of the syllabus asks about God and causation. Many students will have encountered arguments for and against the existence of God. These arguments will be discussed in detail and also the problem of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient benevolent God with the apparent existence of evil in the world. The primary question about causation is simply what it is for one thing to cause another. Your alarm clock may go off every morning just before sunrise; but it doesn’t cause the sun to rise. What is missing? The second part of the syllabus tackles the mind and minded beings, and includes questions about free will. Is anything we do ever up to us? Can we have any choice at all if everything we do is the inevitable result of things beyond our control, such as facts about the distant past and laws of nature? Then there is the mind-body problem: What is the relation between mental and physical phenomena? Finally, the question of personal identity asks about the metaphysical nature of minded beings: What does it take for us to persist through time? Can we swap bodies or brains or minds?2. Ethics and political philosophyThis paper introduces a selection of the main problems in philosophical ethics and political philosophy. Can we know what is morally right and wrong, or is there nothing to be known because, in making pronouncements on moral matters, people are merely expressing their own emotions? Do people ever act completely altruistically, or is there a selfish element in all motivation? If we can act purely for others, why should we do so when it would be inconvenient for our own projects? One influential ethical theory, utilitarianism, prescribes that we should act so as to maximize the net balance of happiness over suffering. It faces a variety of objections, and has taken many forms, often in response to objections. The course aims to provide an understanding of the main variants, and to provide the necessary tools for evaluating them. The course also looks at the concept of Equality of Opportunity, and aims to get new students thinking about issues directly relevant to them, such as ‘who should get into Cambridge?’ Finally, it introduces a central topic in political philosophy, namely the question of political obligation and authority. With what right does the state rule over us? What are the conditions in which we are obliged to obey one political authority or another?3. LogicThis paper introduces basic issues in the philosophy of logic and language as well as key ideas of formal logic. There is a complex interplay between these informal and formal elements of the course. The central notion is that of a valid argument (e.g. All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; so Socrates is mortal). Arguments can be constructed in English and in the various formal languages that the logician invents, and formalised arguments are supposed to tell us something about the corresponding English arguments. Hence we need to know what an argument is, what validity is, and why it is significant. Are all good arguments valid? Are all valid arguments good? Validity of English arguments is an imprecise and intuitive notion, but validity of arguments framed in a formal language can be, and in this course is, made precise. Students practice translating between English and various formal languages: this helps them understand modern philosophical writings, in which uses of this symbolism are common. They also study the notion of meaning, which is central to the philosophy of logic and to the philosophy of language; as well as the nature of the elements of which meaningful statements are made up, such as names, descriptions and quantifier phrases. An important topic, which bridges the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind, is the relation between the meanings of sentences and the beliefs, intentions and conventions of language users.  Finally, there is the alleged distinction between analytic and synthetic truths. Analytic truths seem to be true solely in virtue of their meaning (e.g. All bachelors are unmarried) unlike synthetic truths, which require the world to be a certain way (e.g. Most people die before the age of 80). How is this distinction related to two others, that between necessary and contingent truths and that between a priori and a posteriori truths? And are there any analytic truths anyway?4. Set textsThis paper offers an introduction to the study of the history of philosophy. You will be required to develop a detailed knowledge of the texts you study and of relevant aspects of their historical background. At the same time, you will be encouraged to exercise your own judgment on the interpretation of the texts and the arguments and other materials they contain. You may be asked to study texts such as Plato, Meno; or Descartes, Meditations on first philosophy; or Mill, On Liberty and The Subjection of Women. Currently students are asked to study two out of three set texts but remember that by the time you arrive in Cambridge these texts may have changed and they are only listed here as examples.Students normally take Part IB in their second year. Two papers — metaphysics and epistemology, and logic — are currently compulsory: they develop themes and issues introduced in Part IA and introduce further concepts that are essential to the understanding of much current philosophy. In addition, students choose two other subjects from a range covering topics in ethics, Greek and Roman philosophy (from the Faculty of Classics Tripos), early modern philosophy, philosophy of science, political philosophy, and experimental psychology.1. Metaphysics and epistemologyThis paper covers a range of central questions in metaphysics and epistemology, including mind-dependence, the nature of possibility and necessity, the nature and sources of knowledge, and the challenge of scepticism.2. LogicThis paper extends the study of both the formal and the philosophical components of logic that students began to study in the first year.  Topics covered include theories of meaning, truth, logical form, names and descriptions, and theories of logic.3. EthicsThis paper covers a wide range of issues in contemporary and historical moral philosophy, including helping and harming, early modern moral philosophy, and moral psychology and motivation.4. Greek and Roman philosophyThis paper aims to introduce the variety and scope of ancient philosophy within its historical and cultural context. Students are introduced to a wide range of ancient texts from the pre-Socratics, through Plato and Aristotle, to Hellenistic and Roman philosophy. This paper is offered from Part IB of the Classical Tripos.5. Early modern philosophyThis paper aims to provide an opportunity to study some of the central problems of early modern philosophy, approached through the works of central authors such as Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley and Hume. It examines the way these problems developed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and considers how some of the greatest philosophers of the period proposed to solve them. At the same time, it offers an opportunity to study key philosophical texts in depth. These aims are reflected in the examination, which includes both questions about individual philosophers and broader, comparative questions.6. Philosophy of science This paper examines the nature and confirmation of scientific method, the nature of explanation in the various sciences, the status and character of laws of nature, and philosophical problems generated by the theory of probability. It also introduces the students to some of the central issues in the philosophy of physics.7. Political philosophy This paper examines a set of central issues in contemporary political philosophy and can work as an introduction to the subject. It is focused on the analysis of central political values, such as equality and liberty; and on the nature and justification of democracy.8. Experimental psychology This paper covers human experimental psychology, human learning and memory, neuropsychology, intelligence, developmental psychology, reasoning, emotion, and abnormal psychology. It involves practical work in the Psychological Laboratory. A scientific GCE A level or equivalent is not a prerequisite but may be an advantage for some of the material taught in the course. This paper is offered from Part IB of the Natural Sciences Tripos.This part of the Tripos is normally taken in a student’s third year at Cambridge. There are no compulsory subject papers. Instead there is a wide range of options, some providing a more extended and sophisticated treatment of themes introduced in Parts IA and IB, others (such as Aesthetics) covering new areas. The papers currently taught are as follows:1. MetaphysicsThis paper continues the study of metaphysics and the nature of mind, including such topics as realism and idealism, the nature of properties, the abstract and the concrete, the nature and direction of time and of causation, and the nature of personhood.2. Philosophy of mindThis paper focuses on a range of questions in the contemporary philosophy of mind. Topics studied include what the mind is and how it works; how one knows about the mind (either one’s own or others’); the nature of consciousness and intentionality, and the nature of the will, emotion and imagination.3. EthicsThis paper provides an opportunity to study a wide range of issues in contemporary and historical moral philosophy, including questions of ethical realism, irrealism, expressivism and constructivism; the nature of well-being; Kant’s Ethics and Kantian Ethics; and topics in moral psychology such as trust, the ethics of knowing and responsibility.4. European philosophy from KantThis paper covers the central movements of nineteenth century European philosophy, beginning with Kant and currently continuing through Hegel to Nietzsche. The course is a background to any engagement with later movements in European thought.5. Philosophy in the Long Middle Ages This paper covers philosophy in the period from c.400 to c. 1700, in the Latin, Arabic and Hebrew traditions. The texts of some of the most significant philosophers in this period are studied in translation, focusing on core topics in epistemology and metaphysics (in 2015-16: Universals, and Scientific Truth and Revelation).6. Philosophy of ScienceThis paper offers targeted study of the philosophies of the various sciences, including physics, biology and the social sciences. There is also the opportunity to study one general topic in the philosophy of science (in 2015-16: Philosophy of Cognitive Science).7. Mathematical logic The modern philosophy of mathematics has been shaped by technical results in mathematical logic, such as Gödel's incompleteness theorems and the Church-Turing undecidability theorem, which demonstrate the limitations of certain sorts of formal treatment of mathematics. This paper gives students a chance to study these technical results in detail and reflect on their philosophical significance. Some background in mathematics (e.g. A-level mathematics or equivalent) is advisable.8. Philosophical logic This paper includes advanced topics in logic and the philosophy of language such as truth and meaning; conditionals; and plurals. The paper also includes advanced topics in the philosophy of mathematics, including theories about the nature of logic and mathematics.9. WittgensteinLudwig Wittgenstein was one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. The paper focuses on his two central works, the Tractatus and Philosophical Investigations, as well as On Certainty, which he was working on just before his death. The interpretation of Wittgenstein's works has proved controversial, and the course provides an introduction to exegetical cruces in all the texts specified, as well as experience in relating those issues to ones in contemporary philosophy of mind and language.10. Political philosophy This paper examines a range of advanced topics in political philosophy, including global political issues such as immigration and international justice; multiculturalism and community; feminism; and radical political theory.11. Aesthetics This paper deals with central questions that arise in connection with the study of art and beauty, such as the nature of artistic representation and expression, the nature and value of art and aesthetic experience; the connection between art and morality; and the nature of aesthetic interpretation.PAPERS FROM PART II OF THE CLASSICAL TRIPOS THAT MAY BE TAKEN IN PART IIA candidate for Part II of the Philosophy Tripos may take one or two of the following papers:Group B (Ancient Philosophy)B1. Plato (2015–2016)These lectures will address issues in Plato’s logic, epistemology and metaphysics by exploring various dialogues including the Parmenides, the Euthydemus, the Cratylus, the Theaeteus, and the Sophist. Central themes will include the nature of language and dialectic, the possibility of falsehood, and the existence of Forms. Use the OCT for the Greek text; good translations of all the dialogues are available in the one volume edition of J. Cooper, Plato, Complete Works (Hackett 1997).B2. Aristotle’s world, from turtles to tragedies (2015–2016)Aristotle is invoked by thinkers as diverse as political theorists seeking communitarian alternatives to liberal individualism, and moral philosophers seeking to replace legalistic Kantianism with anything from moral particularism to virtue ethics. For Aristotle, however, his moral and political thought formed one continuous series of reflections. This course examines the whole of that thought, as presented in the Politics and the Nicomachean Ethics.The lectures for this course are intended to be accessible to all students, classicists and others, regardless of their knowledge of Greek.B3. A prescribed subject or period in Greek and Roman philosophyIn 2015–2016: ‘Reason and reasoning’Greeks loved reasoning, for advancing practical ends (like doing down a rival in a lawcourt), for achieving theoretical enlightenment (like demonstrating a geometrical theorem beyond all cavil), and sometimes for sheer entertainment (like the agons in tragedy, or contests between rival sophists). Greeks also liked to theorise about reasoning: by no means the strangest example is Plato’s doctrine of the Philosopher Kings, that people are qualified to share in government only if they have extremely well-developed powers of abstract reasoning.PAPER FROM PART IIB OF THE THEOLOGICAL AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES TRIPOS THAT MAY BE TAKEN IN PART IIA candidate for Part II of the Philosophy Tripos may also take Paper C11, Metaphysics, from Part IIB of the Theological and Religious Studies Tripos. This paper is designed to provide third year undergraduates with a systematic understanding of the contemporary problems of religious metaphysics, and to enable them to argue rationally and convincingly between alternative positions, both religious and anti-religious.Students will be asked to contact the Faculty of Divinity for further details. Responsibility for the teaching of philosophy at Cambridge is divided between the Faculty of Philosophy and the individual colleges. The Faculty organizes lectures, logic classes, discussion groups and seminars. The Director of Studies at each individual college organizes tutorials (known in Cambridge as supervisions) for its students. This division of responsibility contributes to the diversity of philosophy teaching at Cambridge, since it allows the Director of Studies to tailor each student's teaching to his or her own abilities and needs.LecturesIn the first two years of the course the lectures organised by the Faculty introduce students to the concepts and arguments characteristic of philosophical debates. At Part II level, some lectures are more advanced, and lecturers may take the opportunity to develop new positions rather than just explore the existing state of the debate.Although the lectures are designed to provide adequate coverage of the content of each part of the course, they do not define the content of the course or any part of it. Students are free to approach the topics they study in their own way; equally, lecturers are not constrained by the need to cover all the topics of a paper in their lectures.It is a general principle of Cambridge University that its lectures are open to all members of the University. This is especially useful for philosophy students because philosophical arguments have an important place in several academic disciplines and so there may be lectures relevant to philosophers in various departments of the University other than the Faculty of Philosophy – Classics, History, Divinity, Human, Social and Political Science, and History and Philosophy of Science. It is normal practice, therefore, for philosophy students to attend lectures organised by these departments.Discussion groups and classesThe Faculty organises logic classes for first year students, and discussion groups for first and second year students. The latter provide an opportunity for students from different colleges to meet each other and compare and develop their responses to philosophical issues. The teaching for advanced Part II courses sometimes takes the form of seminar discussions rather than lectures, and can in some cases be open both to graduates and undergraduate students.SupervisionsAll students have a Director of Studies appointed by their college to oversee their work, give advice on the choice of papers and arrange supervisions. Most Directors of Studies will do some supervisions themselves; but philosophy students will have several different supervisors during their Cambridge careers, possibly including other Faculty teaching officers and advanced postgraduate students.Philosophy students can expect to have one supervision each week. Probably the most distinctive feature of reading philosophy at Cambridge is that supervisions are usually one-to-one. The supervisor will set an essay on a topic covered by the syllabus and recommend relevant reading. The student will then hand in the essay prior to the supervision so that the supervisor can read and comment on it in advance. The supervision itself is then devoted to a critical discussion of the essay topic.MeetingsThe Moral Sciences Club is the University's main philosophical society. (Its name reflects the fact that until 1973 the Cambridge philosophy course was called the Moral Sciences Tripos.) It meets every Tuesday at 2 p.m. during term to hear and discuss talks normally given by visiting philosophers. All members of the Faculty, from first year undergraduates to professors, are welcome to join.The Amoral Sciences Club is run by undergraduates and puts on an alternative series of philosophy talks.The Immoral Sciences Club is run by undergraduates and provides support and collaboration for women and non-binary people studying philosophy.Once a year the Faculty invites an eminent philosopher to give an Open Lecture, currently sponsored by Routledge Publishers. Recent lecturers include Amartya Sen, the late Sir Michael Dummett, the late Sir Bernard Williams, Professor Jerry Fodor, Professor Ronald Dworkin, Professor Thomas Pogge, Professor Richard Moran, Professor Philip Pettit, Professor David Luban, Professor Susan Wolf, Professor Michael Bratman, Professor Judith Jarvis Thomson and Professor Peter Singer. Professor Peter Singer, who gave the Routledge Lecture in 2017(photo by Barbara Oehring) There are examinations for each part of the philosophy course in late May/early June, in the second half of the Easter (third) term. Part IA students sit one three-hour examination for each of their four subjects, in which they normally have to answer three essay-type questions. In addition they sit a fifth paper in which they write one longer essay over three hours. The aim of this General Paper is to encourage students to reflect on broader issues than arise in the context of the subject papers, and to reward originality and flexibility as much as knowledge of specific areas of the subject.Part IB students may if they wish replace one of their written exam papers with two extended essays written in their own time earlier in the year on appropriate topics. Part II students also have this option, and they also may submit one longer dissertation in place of another written exam paper: this can be on any philosophical topic of the student's choosing that the Faculty is able to teach and examine.Each part of the Tripos is marked separately and independently. There is no overall mark/class for all 3 years of study.The Faculty aims to detach undergraduate teaching, and especially supervisions, from the examination process. We encourage students to work through difficult points throughout the year with no fear that any misunderstandings will be counted against their final marks. LibrariesThe Casimir Lewy Library is the primary source of printed and electronic material needed for the study and teaching of philosophy in Cambridge. It covers all the areas taught in the Philosophy Tripos as well as most of the areas researched by graduates and teaching staff. The library stock, therefore, extends well beyond philosophy itself to cover the interdisciplinary subjects related to philosophy taught and researched in the University.The Casimir Lewy LibraryThe University Library, as one of Britain's five copyright libraries, holds every academically important book published in Britain since the early eighteenth century, as well as extensive stocks from overseas.The Classics, Divinity, History, and History and Philosophy of Science libraries also contain much material useful to philosophy students, as do college libraries.Language LearningVarious courses in languages useful to philosophers are open to students and the University Language Centre is open to all students.ComputingAll students are encouraged to use University Public Workstation Facilities (PWF) which are located in many sites around the University. Most of the computers in the Faculty Library are part of the Raised Faculty Building PWF. This service gives access to a number of electronic resources and word processing. Wireless networking is available in most areas of the Faculty.E-mail is the normal method of communication between students and the Faculty's staff.All colleges also provide computing facilities for their students. Many give access to electronic resources via wifi or ethernet sockets installed in students' study bedrooms. Disabled StudentsColleges judge applications from students with physical disabilities on the same academic terms as those from other candidates. However, they find it helpful to know in advance about the degree of a candidate's disability or impairment, so that they can offer advice on the suitability of their facilities. Prospective candidates with questions about the Faculty's own facilities should contact the Faculty Office.Information on the University's Disability Resource Centre can be found at:  www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/disability/ Deciding to read philosophy at Cambridge does not commit you to a narrow range of careers. Our recent graduates include an RAF test pilot as well as IT consultants, management consultants, fund-raisers, civil servants, lawyers, arts administrators and teachers. In addition, many of our students choose to carry on with further study towards graduate degrees such as the M.Phil and Ph.D in philosophy. For some of them philosophy will become their career: the last time we tried to count, there were 58 people holding senior posts in philosophy departments around the world who started their philosophical careers by reading for a degree in the Cambridge Philosophy Faculty. Undergraduate admissions are handled by individual colleges and not by the Faculty of Philosophy.

A philosopher will ask you what the nature of truth is, what you think beauty is, and even what it means to say that one thing is identical to another. As a student of philosophy you’ll often be asked by the uninitiated, ‘what IS philosophy?’; and even after three years you may struggle to answer. Philosophy is defined more by its methods than by the topics which it covers, taking an in-depth and critical view on fundamental questions about the universe and our functioning within it. The questions may be about time, morality, justice, possibility, even the nature of philosophy itself.Philosophy is hard work. There are always more books to get through, and philosophers are not renowned for their reader-friendly prose! But when you do get through your weekly reading or finally understand that argument you never really got before, it can be hugely rewarding. And Cambridge is a great place to study this exciting and challenging discipline. Even in first year, your lecturers will rarely just talk through the reading list. Instead they will use lectures as an opportunity to investigate genuinely original ideas and discuss new ways of looking at old problems.There are usually around 50 students in each year. Most people will not have had the chance to study Philosophy at school, and students come to Philosophy from all possible combinations of A-levels.Supervisions are a big part of what makes philosophy at Cambridge unique. Each week you will receive feedback on an essay you have prepared, and engage in real, in-depth, philosophical discussion. While this may seem daunting at first, you soon realise how valuable it is. Getting the chance to discuss your ideas one on one with your supervisor (who may well have written the foremost book on your topic) allows you not only to develop your ideas but also to gain experience in defending your point of view and learning to anticipate objections.Logic is central to the course at Cambridge, and is a compulsory paper for the first two years. This will be different from anything you’ll have studied at school, but is one of the most rewarding parts of the syllabus, providing you with a critical eye which will help you grapple with any area in philosophy. Despite what you might think, having done Maths A-Level is by no means a prerequisite for finding this part of the course fulfilling.In your second and third years you have the option to take papers from other faculties, such as Divinity, Classics and Psychology, which gives you a chance to gain a new perspective and learn a different way of thinking about and tackling problems. Philosophy in Cambridge also extends beyond the lecture room and the library, with philosophical societies from the prestigious Moral Sciences Club to the more casual Amoral Sciences Club or Women in Philosophy Society. More often than not, a fascinating supervision discussion or a really great lecture will feed conversations with other students. Many a philosophical epiphany is had over coffee in the Sidgwick Site cafe. Studying philosophy at Cambridge, you will learn how to argue, think critically and examine ideas, and gain skills that will be useful in any future career. The course is for anyone who loves to analyse in rigorous detail how arguments fit together or fail, who questions everything, and who wants to learn more about the field.Ellen Judson, Trinity HallMatthew van der Merwe, Gonville and Caius The University reserves the right in every case, at its discretion and for any reason, to make changes in regulations, syllabuses and fees without prior notice, and to alter or not to offer degree programmes or parts of degree programmes.

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge The claim that violently misogynistic pornography (abuse porn) causes gender-based violence (GBV) is controversial and notoriously resistant to empirical confirmation or disconfirmation. In this talk, I begin with the more generally accepted claim that GBV exists—and is a big problem—and ask: How does the existence of abuse porn—and its spillover into mainstream entertainment—affect those who have been victims of GBV and those who, at least some of the time, live in fear of it? I argue that the prevalence of abuse porn further victimizes survivors of GBV by subjecting them to testimonial and hermeneutical injustice.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge Maybe the most important argument in David Chalmers's monumental book Constructing the World is the one he calls the `Frontloading Argument'. It is one of two arguments used in Chapter 4 to argue for the central thesis of the book, A Priori Scrutability. And, at first blush, the Frontloading Argument looks very strong. I shall be arguing here, however, that it is incapable of securing the conclusion it is meant to establish. The argument requires subsidiary premises that are not only sufficient by themselves to establish A Priori Scrutability but are arguably far stronger.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge "Is beauty a property of an object or merely in the eye of the beholder? In ontology of aesthetic properties, subjectivist non-realism has been the dominant view. Against this trend, I advance a novel realist position, which conceives of aesthetic properties as powers; I draw on recent dispositionalist accounts of powers to flesh out my claim. I show how such realism about aesthetic powers solves two puzzles in aesthetics, and I explain how the case of aesthetic properties is different from the case of colours. Though the resulting position might seem counter-intuitive, I claim it in fact captures the contemporary art critical Zeitgeist, which is more concerned with powers objects have over potential spectators, and less with the beholder herself.Onora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic

   © 2017 University of CambridgeFaculty of PhilosophyStudying at Cambridge The Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club is devoted to the publication and discussion of philosophical papers. But such a bare description does not suffice. If as Wittgenstein believed philosophy is a vice or disease of the mind, then Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club is a high-class brothel or leper colony, where the degenerate or afflicted may fraternise in a tasteful and secluded environment. Or it is a greenhouse or other horticultural receptacle in which was nurtured the intellectual flower of the early twentieth-century East Anglia: among others, Keynes, Russell, Ramsey, Wittgenstein and Moore. In short, this ancient institution has played a major role in the history of analytical philosophy, and continues to do so today. What were its origins?There are records of a Moral Sciences Club having been founded in 1874. But that Club lapsed within two years, and the first meeting of the modern Club took place on Saturday 19 October 1878. On that day Alfred Caldecott, a third year Moral Sciences undergraduate at St John's, presided over and hosted a meeting in which the Club's constitution was agreed. Present at the meeting were Caldecott, seven other undergraduates of St John's and two of Trinity. Among them were Joseph Jacobs, a friend of George Eliot's, and Alfred Mummery, soon to be appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at King's College London-a post in which he was succeeded by Caldecott. It was decided at this meeting that the Club would be open only to those who were reading for or had taken a degree in Moral Sciences.The first meeting of the Club at which a paper was given, took place in the rooms of T.E. Scrutton, Trinity, at 9pm on Saturday 26 October. The paper, by Caldecott, was "Development Theories of Conscience". About thirty students attended. The attendance is pretty much the same today as is the tone of the Club's minutes. For example, in1880 we find the following minute (by G.E. Humphreys, Caius) :After the minutes of the last meeting had been read (by Mr Frost in the absence of the Secretary) and approved, there was a long and unusual break in the continuity of the proceedings from the fact that the reader of the paper did not make his appearance until 5 minutes to 10 o'clock. The excuse given was that having retired to the Gog hills to meditate upon some unusually obscure Hegelianisms he had become so lost in thought that it was only when curfew broke in upon the current of his reflections that he remembered he was still a being belonging to this world, to Cambridge and to the Moral Science Club. With this preface Mr Rees proceeded to read his paper on "The Philosophy of History."It is a measure of the decline in Hegel's influence at Cambridge that speakers nowadays are almost never late. (I am indebted to J. Pitt's article in Russell, Winter 1982).So much for the Club's origins. What about its importance? The emergence of analytical philosophy marked a break with post-Kantian metaphysics as the latter had evolved both in England and in Continental Europe. It offered a new conception of philosophical problems and suggested new ways to solve them. If Bolzano was the St John the Baptist of this movement and Frege its Jesus Christ, then Russell was its St Paul, Cambridge his Damascus, and what is now the M11 his road thereto. In this typology the Moral Sciences Club corresponds to an early church, say that of Antioch, instrumental in the introduction and dissemination of the new doctrines. This was manifested in two ways.The concentration of great philosophers at Cambridge made the Club the forum at which a number of seminal papers received their first airing. One of the founding documents of analytical philosophy, Moore's "Nature of Judgment", was given on 21 October 1898. "Knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description" appeared in 1911 and what became Ramsey's "Truth and Probability" in 1926. Russell's "Limits of Empiricism" was given in Michaelmas 1935; Moore's Paradox appeared in Michaelmas 1944.The Club also disseminates as well as introduces new ideas. The publication of papers does not render a discussion group redundant in this process even if it can only involve a small number of people and only for the course of an evening. We must not overlook the importance of personal intercourse in the spread of ideas. Regrettably often a doctrine is widely accepted less because of its truth than because of the personality of its author. For if a philosopher writes a book he may gain followers; if he gives a talk he is liable to find evangelists.The case of Wittgenstein illustrates this point. It also illustrates the influence of the Club itself. Wittgenstein gave his first paper to the Club in Michaelmas 1912. He and Moore had persuaded the Club to appoint a Chairman to prevent futile discussions and to change the rules so as to limit the duration of talks to seven minutes. Wittgenstein's contribution came on 29 November (the Club's meetings had moved to Fridays to avoid clashing with the Apostles); the minutes are as follows:Mr Wittgenstein read a paper entitled "What is Philosophy?" The paper lasted only about 4 minutes, thus cutting the previous record established by Mr Tye by nearly two minutes. Philosophy was defined as all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences. This defn. was much discussed, but there was no general disposition to adopt it. The discussion kept very much to the point, and the Chairman did not find it necessary to intervene much.As far as I know Wittgenstein's record still stands, and it is unlikely that it will ever be beaten, now that the 7-minute restriction has been replaced by a 30-minute one – which many speakers moreover treat more as a minimum than a maximum. Perhaps the Club should institute a Prize for the shortest talk of the year.Wittgenstein's return to Cambridge in 1929 inaugurated his domination of Cambridge philosophy and in particular of the Moral Sciences Club. For example Broad once remarked, in explanation of his non-attendance, that "he was not prepared to spend hours every week in a thick atmosphere of cigarette-smoke, while Wittgenstein punctually went through his hoops and the faithful as punctually 'wondered with a foolish look of praise.'" It was in response to this that Broad introduced the rule-which still exists though its principal target has been dead for fifty years-that a speaker may request the 'starring' of a meeting (meaning that only junior Members are permitted to attend it).After Moore resigned the Chairmanship in 1944 on grounds of ill-health, Wittgenstein took over. By this time, I conjecture, the Club had become his conduit in two ways. First, it was obviously a medium for his own philosophical ideas. But secondly, public debate gave him the opportunity to air-and to infect others with-his contempt for other living philosophers, to their face. And Ryle said that at meetings of the Club, "veneration for Wittgenstein was so incontinent that mentions, for example, my mentions, of any other philosopher were greeted with jeers... Wittgenstein gave the impression, first that he himself was proud not to have studied other philosophers... and second, that he thought that people who did study them were academic and therefore unauthentic philosophers."No account of the Club would be complete without a brief description of the most notorious meeting of all (possibly excepting I Hacking's lively 1998 summary of knitwear production techniques in British Columbia). This was the poker-involving confrontation between Wittgenstein and Popper at a meeting of the Club on 26 October 1946 at which Popper read a paper entitled "Are there Philosophical Problems?".Opinion is divided over exactly what happened at that meeting. Some say that Popper and Wittgenstein, having lashed one another into a philosophical frenzy, came to blows, each armed with a poker. Popper himself states in his autobiography that Wittgenstein brandished a poker at Popper, demanding an example of a moral rule, to which Popper replied: "Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers", whereupon Wittgenstein is said to have thrown down the poker and stormed out of the room. Others say that it was Russell who made this amusing remark. Consistent with all of these views was the opinion of the Secretary, W. Hijab (Trinity), who says in his minute that the meeting "was charged to an unusual degree with the spirit of controversy". (The occasion is the subject of a best-selling recent book, Wittgenstein's Poker)The Club has flourished from that day to this. Practically every major philosopher since the War has spoken here at one time or another. Recent years have seen a number of famous visitors (e.g. A. Gibbard, F. Jackson, D. Lewis, C. Wright, T. Williamson) and a broad range of subjects. On one occasion in the present writer's memory, a speaker continued delivering his paper over a fire alarm. It indicates the dedication of both him and his audience that one and all scorned to leave the room, prepared to risk incineration rather than miss the speaker's insights into possible worlds. On another occasion, the meeting ended early because the speaker gave up in the middle of the question period after somebody had made a decisive point against him. Would that all philosophers were so honest!The Club has moved around Cambridge too. For many years until 1998 it was installed in Clare under the amiable guidance of Professor Smiley. After that it moved to Darwin and then to St John's. Every year there the Club changes its Secretary. As has been customary ever since its foundation, the Secretary is drawn from the student body. A number of previous secretaries have gone on to careers in philosophy.Hijab spoke of the "spirit of controversy". The visitor to the Club will find that spirit alive and well; as there is no fireplace in the Dirac Room, he may in addition be assured that the risk of physical injury is nowadays fairly low.Arif AhmedOnora O’Neill has won the 2017 Berggruen Prize for PhilosophyRae Langton talks on free speech on BBC Radio 4Report on the ethics of cosmetic procedures publishedView all newsEleventh Annual Cambridge Graduate Conference on the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic
