(1) Those who proposed and spoke in favor of the founding of the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology at that meeting were Albert B. Lord, Charles Dunn, and Einar Haugen, who also served on the committee in its early years, as did, for example, Frank Cross, Daniel Ingalls, David Maybury-Lewis, David McClellan, Rulan Chao Pian, Eileen Southern, Evon Vogt, John Ward and Cedric Whitman. In broader terms, however, Harvard’s long engagement with the study of oral literature, of epics and ballads, cosmological and other mythic narratives, popular culture, traditional belief systems and all the many forms of expressive manifestation of culture that constitute the study of folklore and mythology goes back much, much further. And, in fact, there is a direct line that leads from the current generation of Harvard scholars in this field back to that group of distinguished faculty who fashioned the committee, and from them, even further back into the early 1800s; indeed, many of the most storied figures in the history of the University’s commitment to the humanities and interpretive social sciences worked in these fields, among others, Milman Parry, Clyde Kluckhohn, Fred Norris Robinson, George Lyman Kittredge, Francis James Child, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. (2)Indeed, it is anything but accidental that the founding of the American Folklore Society, the key professional association in the field in the US, took place at Harvard in the Faculty Room of University Hall on 4 January 1888. (3) When some eight decades later, in that same room, the Faculty voted to establish a committee to oversee the awarding of degrees in the field, it was noted that the proposed concentration would be both truly interdisciplinary and would "draw strength from the possibility of designing a wide variety of individual course programs and from the provision of tutorial." That foresighted foundation of the program, based on rigorous methodological training combined with flexible and sympathetic attention to the individual student’s intellectual interests, has proved to be a remarkably durable and successful recipe for the lives and careers of the program’s students. Many of our undergraduates have gone on to take advanced degrees in the many fields for which “Folk & Myth” prepares them and have had outstanding careers in the academy; at the same time, as with all concentrations, the overwhelming majority of former students have had rewarding careers in such disparate fields as medicine, law, business, politics, finance, media, the performing arts, and journalism.   (1) Attached please find a facsimile of the minutes of the 7 March 1967 FAS meeting.(2) This branch of Harvard tradition is detailed in David E.

    Contact**********************KEYNOTE ADDRESSFriday, April 8, 2016 - 6:00 pm, Barker Center 133********************** Margaret Mills, Ohio State University (Professor Emerita) How Stories Lodge in Lives Mary Frere’s Old Deccan Days (1868) introduction to the storyteller, Anna Liberata deSouza, abundantly illustrates how the performer’s choices among traditional stories reflected specific challenges of a personal life full of loss. Frere’s framing of the stories set a model for attention to individual artistry and contexts of performance not again pursued in South Asia till the mid-20th century, with the performance turn in folklore studies. In recent decades, Wadley, Gold and Raheja, Narayan, Prasad, Naithani, and Narasamamba, among others, developed text presentations and analyses linking repertoire, performance, and personal history in various ways.  As Ramanujan has pointed out, vrat katha itself is a major ritual genre in which the telling of stories shapes performatively the lives of the tellers and listeners, both in the ostensibly biographical miracle narratives framed within the ritual and the lives of the ritual participants who keep the stories alive. Blackburn’s  Another Harmony itself offered a foundational analysis of relationships of biography, narrative performance genre and ritual efficacy in South Asia.  The present paper reviews trajectories of this complex from biography to ritual studies and ends with some reflections on why the studies of performed narrative in and of lives have more usually, though not exclusively, focused on women protagonists and performers. Are we missing parallels in men’s equally situated narrative performances, or is there a systematic difference in performative focus determined by genre and/or gender?  _________________________________________________________________________SYMPOSIUM PANELSSaturday, April 9, 2016 - 9:00 am - 6:00 pm - Thompson Room, Barker CenterUNDERGRADUATE STUDENT PANEL Aniket De, Tufts University Divided Songs, Altered Gods: Partition, Nationalism, and Performance in the Bengal BorderlandThis paper studies the history of the Gambhira, a popular performance on either side of the India-Bangladesh border, mainly in Malda (West Bengal) and Rajshahi (Bangladesh). Gambhira originated from rites of the god Hindu Shiva, and later became a popular theatre form in which both Hindu and Muslim performers complained to Shiva, with ridicule, and sarcasm, about people in power. After the Partition of British India in 1947, many Muslim performers fled across the border to East Pakistan (later Bangladesh). The Muslim performers, in Bangladesh’s Islamic context, replaced the figure of Shiva with that of a Muslim farmer, and continued the performance’s older tradition of questioning authority. The paper explores the interaction between broader structural changes in state structure and the consequent impact on folk forms. I explore the realities of such performances in the borderland, as well as the competing historical metanarratives on the changes and continuities in Gambhira. Benjamin D. Grimm, Harvard University Trans-gression: Gender, Divinity, and Cross-dressing in the Krishna LīlāhavaThe līlahāva – a story in which Krishna and Rādhā exchange clothes during a night of passion – is inflected in poetry, art, and drama, and in its many loci cloaks itself in various symbolic modes: as comedic farce, as amorous play, and as a profound act of devotion. The story is imbued by tense dichotomies of male and female, divine and human, unity and disunity: is it transgressive for a cowherdess to wear Krishna’s peacock-feather crown? If so, from what does this transgression spring? The act of crossdressing exhumes basic tensions between male and female in Hindu thought. Moreover, it leads us to question the very nature of Krishna’s divinity; assuming one another’s identity reveals Rādhā as a mirror of Krishna, suggesting that she is indeed a divine consort, an endemic aspect of his own being. Declaring transgression in the līlahāva emerges from cultural – and thus human – prescriptions for a pair who is incontrovertibly transcendent.  Megan Taing, Harvard University Brotherhood and Humor: Negotiating the South Asian American College Experience  This study analyzes the interaction among members of an all-male South Asian American club at an American university, contending that humor is the principle method through which members negotiate bicultural tensions. While seemingly raucous, judgmental, or even discriminatory on the surface, their jokes reveal a deeper sentiment of tolerance and support between members of the club. This mentorship vis-à-vis comedy can be invaluable to some South Asian American males transitioning from a stricter home life to more independence in college – including newfound freedom within the academic and romantic relationship domains. By maintaining membership in a South Asian American brotherhood of sorts, these students are able to retain ties to a familiar part of their identities, the “traditional” upbringing and expectations of their parents, while simultaneously exploring and receiving peer feedback on new interests that could contradict the familiar itself.  SOUTH ASIAN FOLKLORE IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Frank J. Korom, Boston University Three Decades of Folklore Studies in South Asia: Toward a History Another Harmony marked the end of a previous era and signaled a new one in terms of studying South Asian folklore. This paper surveys the past thirty years of folkloristic scholarship on South Asia to identify significant contributions but also to point out gaps in areas of research that demand more and fuller attention. I conclude that while much has been done in the area of verbal art, very little has been done to address material culture. Moreover, the output of work on folklore in South Asia has been predominantly Indocentric, that is to say focusing almost exclusively on India at the expense of that nation’s neighbors in the region. Lastly, an overwhelming majority of the academic literature that one might call “folkloristic” focuses on Hindu traditions, while far less attention has been paid to Islam, and even less on Christianity, Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism. Adheesh Sathaye, University of British ColombiaThe Scribal Life of Folktales in Premodern India This paper will explore how and why, about a thousand years ago, it became popular in India to compile large anthologies of folktales that were told in Sanskrit and disseminated through handwritten manuscripts. Oral variants of these tales are found scattered around the world, and folklorists have long recognized that this diffusion had taken place through an intricate interplay between written and oral modes of transmission. Less understood are the historical motivations for such oral/written interplay, especially within the specific context of the medieval Sanskrit literary culture in which these anthologies were being produced. I propose to sharpen our understanding of the cultural value of folktales in the premodern past, based on the textual history of the Vetāla-pañcaviṃśati (25 Tales of the Animated Corpse) a popular medieval anthology of riddle-tales. I focus on the active role of scribes—both professional and amateur—in carving out a scribal public culture in premodern India, using a combination of folktales, proverbs, and riddles that both complemented and challenged the elite Brahminical intellectual traditions of the time.  Leela Prasad, Duke University Nameless in a Great Garden: When English Imperial Conquest Becomes a Purāṇa My paper will examine a moment on the Indian side of the colonial archive of the anthropology of India to consider an intriguing dramatic poem written by eminent folklorist and literary scholar, P. V. Ramaswami Raju (1852-1897). Sreemat Rajangala Mahodyanam, or The Great Park of The English Raj, is a long poem in Sanskrit with an English translation provided by Raju himself. I will argue that the Raju’s purāṇa-style poem, set in a wondrous garden, operates in two core registers. One register maintains a tension between superlative praise of the English empire and the other is coded criticism about empire itself. I hope to demonstrate that by skillfully incorporating the origin of the English empire (yoked to a narrative about the discovery of America) into a Hindu mythos, Ramaswami Raju is able to project the error of empire as a cosmic error. In this frame, the abrupt ending of the poem, anguished over the namelessness of its protagonist, creates a kind of a moral caesura in the narrative of glory.   SOUTH ASIAN MATERIAL CULTURE & BELIEF Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger, Emory University Standing in Cement: Ravana on the Chhattisgarhi Plains Over the last two decades, an interdisciplinary focus on the body and visual and material culture has emerged in folklore and religious studies, to counter, in part, the traditional textual/verbal focus of the respective disciplines. This paper is part of a larger study of the agency of materiality in Indian traditions, which analyzes different forms of materiality in ritual and everyday contexts. Here, I focus on the 8-10 foot tall cement images of the rakshasa antagonist Ravana of the Ramayana that are unique to the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh. They stand at village and town centers or on open fields at their outskirts.  Dramatic performances and textual readings are held in front of these images during the festival of Dashera, at the end of which firecrackers are set off around the image to indicate Ravana’s destruction. Narratively, the hero-god Ram kills him; however, materially Ravana lives, standing in cement all year. The permanence of the Ravana physical images creates an alternative theology and worldview to that of verbal epic performances. I argue that the cement Ravanas are material actors. Kirin Narayan, Australian National University Making and Narrating: Vishwakarma Family Stories among Artisans Many artisan communities across India trace descent from the Hindu god Vishwakarma, the “Universe Maker.” Identifying themselves by labels marking this family connection—including “Vishwakarmas” or “The Sons of Vishwakarma”—their traditional work was thought to continue their divine ancestor’s making and shaping of the material world. This paper examines themes of making as a form of thinking (Ingold 2013) that pervade the mythology of hereditary artisan castes associated with Vishwakarma (cf. Brouwer 1986). I focus particularly on Gujarat-based family stories and rituals of the goddess Randal Ma, honored as Vishwakarma’s daughter. How, I ask, does this unusually doubled goddess point to larger associations between Vishwakarma kinship, goddess worship, and gendered aspects of making, even as traditional caste occupations have given way to other professions, and the “Make in India” scheme has become a politicized project? Puja Sahney, SUNY- Albany Transnational Spaces of Belonging: Immigration Process, Social Ties, and Hindu Homes of Purity   This paper discusses the role trans-boundary social and symbolic ties play in shaping the way newly arrived Hindu immigrants from India manage and organize spaces in their suburban American homes around the Hindu notion of “purity.” The focus is on the Hindu domestic shrine, an important religious artifact found in Hindu houses, which influences the movement and behavior of family members and Hindus’ efforts to produce and consume religious spaces within and immediately outside the house. The paper argues that Hindu immigrant homes are transnational spaces of belonging. This transnationality of space is regulated both formally through the lengthy immigration process as well as informally through social ties maintained between people across nations. Using ethnographic data, this paper examines the space-artifact continuum around the notion of purity and how the relationships Hindus build and rebuild with domestic spaces reveal important aspects of their sense of belonging in a new country.  Ülo Valk, University of Tartu Where the Goddess Spent her Wedding Night: Place-Lore of the Kāmākhyā Temple in Silghat, Assam The paper discusses mythic histories of the temple of Kāmākhyā in Silghat on the southern bank of Brahmaputra in Nagaon district, Assam. It is based on fieldwork, conducted in the temple and the adjacent village intermittently from 2009–2015, concentrating on the stories of three Brahmin families, who have been serving the temple since its establishment in 1745. Especially important is the position of the temple in the mythic landscape of Assam and the strategies of storytelling to enhance its power of narrative gravitation to attract pilgrims. Place-lore about the temple displays some significant discrepancies and disagreements between the narrators who refer to the authority of literary sources but rely on oral traditions of the neighbourhood and on their family histories.  THE POLITICS OF FOLKLORE Leah Lowthorp, Harvard University Folklore, Politics, and the State: Kutiyattam and National/Global Heritage in India In recent decades, scholars of South Asian folklore have increasingly engaged the politics of folklore, interrogating its role in both colonialist, nationalist, and other political agendas. This paper considers the role of expressive culture in Indian postcolonial nation building through the lens of Kutiyattam Sanskrit theater of Kerala state, recognized as India’s first UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001. Through an examination of the art’s relationship with India’s national academy for dance, drama, and music, the Sangeet Natak Akademi, it traces state heritage discourse and practice over a fifty year period. It thereby explores the (re)production of the State’s role as arts patron and cultural educator, as well as a sustained state-level promotion of artistic continuity through creative adaptation and change. Shakthi Nataraj, University of California, Berkeley Critical Folkloristics and the Study of Transgender Women’s Communities in South India Scholars in the emerging field of "critical folkloristics" have criticized notions of folklore that distinguish it from "modern" institutions, emphasizing instead how notions of modernity and traditionality actively shape one another. My research examines the jamath (family) system of Tamil Nadu's thirunangai (transgender woman) communities that has lately become the object of much controversy amongst LGBT activists. Some see these precolonial kinship structures, placing gurus (mentors), above chelas (disciples), as outdated feudal relics, at odds with "modern" notions of equality. Representatives of transnational non-profits similarly argue that jamaths compromise thirunangai's abilities to effectively make "objective" decisions. Examining narratives of kinship by transgender women that manage and staff a Community Based Organization in Chennai, I argue that the logic of jamath kinship, far from being an outdated relic, both shapes and is shaped by the politics of international LGBT and HIV activism, and the functioning of Community Based Organizations.  Finnian Gerety, Brown University The Amplified Sacrifice: Sound, Technology, and Participation in Vedic Rituals in Kerala  For generations, Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala have performed sacrifices based on liturgies of the first millennium BCE. While their praxis evokes the ideal of an archaic, unchanging sacrifice, the soundscape of Nambudiri ritual culture in recent years has come to reflect technological shifts in Indian society: microphones and megawatt speakers now amplify mantras well beyond the power of the human voice. This paper examines the amplified sacrifice, arguing that local amplification of performances tracks with a regional "amplification" of the cultural prominence of Vedic ritual. This feedback loop increases the participation of non-Nambudiris in the funding, organization, and celebration of such rituals, which are now carried out as festivals with thousands of attendees and a full suite of marketing, media coverage, and VIPs.  FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

This concentration focuses on the study of society, past or present, through its cultural documents and artifacts, and uses a variety of methodologies drawn from the humanities and social sciences. To concentrate on a society’s folklore and mythology (on sub-national as well as national levels) is to understand its traditional self-definition through its epics, ballads, folktales, legends, beliefs, and other cultural phenomena, including music, song, and dance, and studying a group’s folklore shows how it identifies itself in relation to other groups.Concentrators conduct independent research on folklore and mythology in a variety of cultures including, for example, African, American, Chinese, Celtic, English, Greek, German, Japanese, Sanskrit & Indian Studies, Scandinavian, and Slavic. Founded in 1967 and the oldest undergraduate degree program in the field in this country, Folklore and Mythology at Harvard has produced many distinguished graduates. Students often form mutually supportive groups; student-faculty contact is by tradition — and structure — very close; and collegiality within the program is highly valued.  (More…)"Cultures are, after all, collective, untidy assemblages authentificated by belief and agreement, focused only in crisis, systemitized after the fact."(Barbara Myerhoff, Number Our Days)"My professional goals are to make sense of nonsense, find a rationale for the irrational, and seek to make the unconscious conscious."(Alan Dundes)For the latest updates to the website!"Fieldwork involving other people is one of the most intensively personal kinds of scholarly research I know."(Bruce Jackson, Fieldwork)FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

This situation creates a clear need for having a model of the ‘type’ of religion to which PCRN belongs. The problem which will be discussed in the lecture, is thus how we create such a model. There is no doubt that some sort of comparative enterprise is needed, but how would it be meaningful to apply ‘the comparative method’ in relation to PCRN?”[2] Hughes: “In his introductory remarks opening the exhibition, “Icelandic Sagas, Eddas, and Art,” held at the Pierpont Morgan Library in 1982, the late Charles Ryskamp, then Director of that august institution,  noted that while his library had a formidable and extensive collection of manuscripts, it did not have a single Icelandic one. The Houghton Library possesses 57.                  The first manuscript was given to the College Library in 1886, and for many decades it was catalogued as a book (Scan.4200.3) before final receiving the designation “MS Icel. 55.” It was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) who began the College’s investment in Scandinavian Studies with the purchase of 650 volumes from Denmark and Sweden in the year before he became Smith Professor of Modern Languages, a position he held from 1836-1854, but it was not until 1893 when Archibald Cary Coolidge (1866-1928) began to teach a half course on Scandinavian History every other year, that Scandinavian Studies can be said to have taken root at Harvard. Coolidge was joined by William Henry Schofield (1870-1920), Instructor in English 1897-1902 (later Professor of Comparative Literature, 1906-1920), who taught the first course in Old Norse in 1900. It was Coolidge who was responsible for engineering in 1904 the purchase of some 10,000 volumes from the library of Konrad von Maurer (1823-1902), Professor of Law at the University of Munich 1847-1888. In the “Zweiter (Nordischer) Teil” of the printed catalog to Maurer’s library, items 2353-2356 are manuscripts. The first three are copies of Jónsbók, two in vellum, now catalogued as MS Icel. 42, 43, and 46. The fourth item, number 2356, lists: “Manuskripte. 39 altnordische Codices (Papierhandschriften) juristischen, theologischen, poetischen und folkloristischen Inhalts.” These were manuscripts that Maurer collected during his journey to Iceland in the summer of 1858. But as the ancients said, “caveat emptor.” This description is only partly correct. To begin with, these manuscripts are not Old Norse, they are early Modern Icelandic, some written as late as the first decade of the nineteenth century, and while they may be characterized as “legal, theological, poetical and folkloristic,” they are in fact much more varied.  This paper looks at some of the highlights of the Maurer collection and those manuscripts that were added later, focusing on those that are likely to be of interest to Old Norse scholars, but not neglecting their variety and their importance to modern as well as medieval scholars.”[3] DuBois: “Old Norse materials regarding the sun present conflcting stories about its identity and nature.  My paper looks at folk song materials from among Sami, Finns, and Latvians to investigate to what extent a shared mythic narrative of a female sun (or sun's daughter) may have existed as a common element in Nordic/Baltic mythologies and whether that figure enters into marriage with other astral figures (e.g., the moon, the stars).  Methodologically, I hope to investigate the extent to which folk song materials--still central in the reconstruction of Finnish and Baltic mythologies but largely rejected in the field of Old Norse studies--can serve as useful tools in reconstructing ancient myths in the region.”[4] Lindow: “The extent to which Finnish/Karelian and Nordic mythologies conform is striking. Both were transmitted in the form of short oral poems in relatively simple verse form (setting aside for a moment skaldic poetry) with varying actors and subject matter. Both characters and plots can be compared: Óðinn and Väinämöinen; Þórr and Ilmarinen; verbal duels; the acquisition of precious objects; seeking women from an out-group; the permanence of death. This paper sets forth and evaluates such points of comparison and sets forth the significant differences. Although I am skeptical about the methodology that posits borrowing to explain similarities, I do find that the comparison rewards exploration in a number of ways.”[5] Cole: “In this paper, I will chiefly be examining the potential impact of Christian iconography regarding the Jews in Snorra Edda. Following work by Heather O'Donoghue ["What has Baldr to do with Lamech?", Medium Ævum 72(2003)] I will also consider resonances from some of the originally Jewish exegetical and magical tradition which had been incorporated into Christian learning by the time Snorri Sturluson was writing.”[6] Hermann: “This paper is about memory in the medieval period and about how memory had an impact on the literature written in that period. The paper will deal with memory in the mythology created by the texts as well as with memory as a medium for transmission of pagan myths.”[7] Heslop: “It is characteristic of the transmission of Old Norse myth and heroic legend that the narratives do not appear ‘as such’, but rather within a frame, for example the ekphrastic framing of the so-called shield poems, the omnipresent framing by various kinds of borders in the visual sources, and the explanatory frames for the poems provided in the Poetic Edda. In this talk, I will compare how narratives are framed in sources from a variety of different points in time and space – possible examples include Beowulf, the Rök runestone, Gotlandic picture stones, Swedish runestones, and the Prose and Poetic Edda – and ask questions such as: what are the normative and formative functions of such narratives? How are processes of transmission staged in visual and verbal narrative? What is the ontological status of the texts and objects that transmit mythic and heroic narrative? What happens when they are received by hearers, readers and viewers?” [8] Glauser: “This paper deals with some of the well-known Old Norse narratives, which are generally interpreted as manifestations of the myth of the intoxicating drink. In contrast to the majority of previous scholarship (Renate Doht, Peter Buchholz, Svava Jakobsdóttir, Jón Hnefill Aðalsteinsson, Heimir Pálsson and others), my presentation will not so much focus on the often-discussed question of a precise definition of the functions of these narratives as mead of sovereignty and /or mead of poetry. The main interest will rather be on some major aspects the specific literary and visual forms in which these narratives were mediated and transmitted.”[9] Kaplan: “If we accept, as many do, that the shadowy author of Vǫlsa þáttr made up this nasty little tale, the question remains: what did he make it out of? This paper approaches Vǫlsa þáttr as a fantasy spun not from half-forgotten heathenism but from folk traditions of the author’s own day.”[10] Gunnell: “The aim of this lecture is to gather together recurring motifs concerning the peculiarities of the religion of those gods referred to as the Vanir (the reported death of whom might be regarded as a touch premature). A range of Old Norse accounts from different times including Ynglinga saga, Gunnars þáttr helmings, Gesta Danorum, Hrafnkels saga, Vatnsdæla saga and more will be used. Many of the aforementioned motifs (commonly concerning ritual activities) tend to be unexplained in the texts but nonetheless have recurring patterns which imply that in their oral traditions, outsiders seem to have seen the religious activities connected with the “Vanir” as having been different in nature to those known outside Sweden. The lecture will consider these differences, and whether they can be considered mere Christian propaganda or perhaps had some distant basis in a “reality” which preceded the arrival of Óðinn, Þórr and the Christian God in Sweden.”[11] Jóhanna Katrín: “Although the evidence of the late sagas (e.g., fornaldarsögur) has been carefully mined over the years for data reflecting on older Nordic mythological traditions, few scholars have treated the Icelandic rímur, in many instances believed to be roughly comparable in age to these extant sagas, with either the same care or the same goals. My paper explores the question whether the rímur could be considered a potentially useful source of information about Norse myth.”[12] Wellendorf: “What are the idols of the Æsir and what is their nature? In my paper I will seek to confront the teachings of the Bible and the Christian tradition with the idols we meet in Old Norse accounts of myth and ritual in the Northern world.”[13] Samplonius: “In recent times, the notion that magic constituted a structural element of Old Nordic Religion has gained much popularity, leading to such interpretations as that one of the women buried at the rich Oseberg Ship funeral had been a vǫlva, and, related to it, that a number of staffs from certain 10th-century graves had been magic wands. The paper discusses whether the sources at our disposal justify any such conclusion.”[14] Zachrisson: “The winged man from Uppåkra, an object that can be placed to the late 8th century, shows a winged man with drops of blood on his left hand/wing. It illustrates perfectly Völund as described in the 13th-c. Þiðriks saga af Bern. The context for the object - the cult house in Uppåkra - is situated in the South Scandinavian region, and marks one of its nodal points. The time-span c. 750 to 1200 and the opinions on Þiðriks saga, as well as the settings in the written texts on Völund (Zealand in Þiðriks saga and Svithiod in Völundarkviða), are the starting points for my discussion of this interesting comparison.”[15] Puett: “This paper will discuss the comparative implications of Old Norse mythology, with a particular focus on China”[16] Nagy: “Traditions about the serpentine element in Ragnar Loðbrók’s heroic biography have been discussed in relation to the episode about the rise and fall of Haftvad’s worm told in the Persian Shahnameh. There are, however, analogs in ancient Greek and medieval Irish literature as well, pointing, I will argue, to an underlying Indo-European mythological pattern.”[17] Witzel: “A variant of the Old Norse myth of Ymir is found in the oldest Indian text, the Rgveda, pointing to a common Indo-European origin. Some other Indo-European speaking peoples have minor, related versions. However, the myth is also found in Old (southern) Chinese myth, and beyond. Questions of origins and local variations will be addressed.”[18] Guðrún: “The eddic poem Grímnismál enjoyed a special place in learned writings about myth and skaldic poetry in the thirteenth century. The complete text of the poem is preserved in the two main manuscripts of the eddic poetry, the Codex Regius and the A manuscript, though not in the same sequence nor do the manuscripts carry the exact same text, and individual stanzas are furthermore cited in Snorra Edda (half of the poem), Óláfr Þórðarson‘sThird Grammatical Treatise and in Litla Skálda. One of the question underpinning the paper is why this mythological poem played such an important role in learned treatises and cosmological imagery in the thirteenth century. The answer gives an insight into the workings of the textual culture at the time.”[19] Bäckvall: “By now, it is hardly controversial to point out that much interesting information about Edda, its contents and reception can be gleaned from the Uppsala manuscript of the work. All manuscripts are different, and some are more different than others. In this paper, I will present some instances of how the Uppsala Edda differs from the other Edda manuscripts when it comes to the mythological content matter in (primarily) Gylfaginning. To put it in another way, I will discuss how our modern ideas of Norse mythology might have been different if thisEdda manuscript were the only surviving one.”[20] Lyle: “An unexpected parallel has emerged between the Baldr narrative and the narrative of Iraj in the PersianShahnameh, and comparison between them may help to throw light on both as expressions of an Indo-European mythic theme.  In both cases, an innocent and defenceless figure is murdered by a pair, one planning and one acting, and in both cases there is a kinship barrier to immediate revenge, and the murdered man/god is eventually avenged by a hero who was not yet born at the time of the murder.”[21] Sundqvist: “In ecclesiastical Latin sources referring to pre-Christian Northern Europe we sometimes meet descriptions of cultic trees/groves and sacrificial wells situated close to temples. Are these descriptions built on atopos taken from mythic traditions or do they reflect a real cosmic symbolism (or a common cultural model) at pre-­Christian cultic sites of these areas? By means of other sources, such as Old Norse texts, place-names and archaeological materials, and a comparative method, I will try to answer this question.”[22] Patton: “Focusing on the methodological challenges of the intersection between sacred histories and historicity (real trees and their exfoliation in ritual practice and the religious imagination).”[23] Rösli: ”The different mythological concepts of ragna rǫk, (Poetic Edda) and ragnarøkr (Prose Edda) have often been interpreted as some sort of fixed ending of the eddic world, followed by a new and independently created world joining a cyclical system of cosmogonies. In this paper I would like to rethink the well-known cyclical structure of these two concepts. I will argue, based on the textual narratives, for a new view on the end of the world and its reshaped and transformed versions.”[24] Nordvig: “There is hardly any culture on Earth that has flourished in close proximity to very active volcanoes without producing a rich mythology about them (e.g.,  Hawai'i, Mesoamerica, Rome). In Iceland, there are very few early stories of volcanism. Current scholarship attributes this to a special Icelandic way of dealing with the coarse, subarctic environment of the island (Þórr Þórðarson, “Perception of Volcanic Eruptions in Iceland” [2010]), but this contradicts everything that is known about the way humans linguistically process their physical surroundings when faced with disasters and natural processes (Barber & Barber, When They Severed Earth from Sky [2004]; Cashman & Cronin, "Welcoming a Monster to the World: Myths, Oral Tradition, and Modern Societal Response to Volcanic Disasters" [2008]). In my talk I will present some examples of where we can find such conceptualizations of volcanism in Old Norse mythology.”[25] Abram: “This paper proposes that the Old Norse myth of Ragnarök illuminates the apocalyptic experience of catastrophic global climate change that we are currently struggling to come to terms with; and our viewpoint at the end of the world (of one world, our world, at least) can provide an important perspective for understanding the events described in Völuspá. The crisis at the heart of Ragnarök is an ecological, and ironical, one: it results from the gods’ apparent success in mastering the physical world.”[26] Price: “There is now general agreement among geoscientists that in the year AD 536, and for varying lengths of time thereafter, several parts of the world experienced a prolonged solar darkness. This took the form of a loosely-termed ‘dust veil’ blocking the sun’s warmth from reaching the earth, traceable in numerous environmental proxies and probably resulting from a massive volcanic eruption in Central America. Numerous textual sources from the period independently describe what was clearly a natural disaster of some magnitude, with a range of catastrophic effects including crop failure, famine and civil strife. In this paper, building on work by the author and other archaeologists including especially Bo Gräslund, the socially transformative impact of the ‘dust veil’ on the late Iron Age cultures of Scandinavia is explored. In particular, attention is devoted to its possible geomythological legacy in the Old Norse stories of the Fimbulwinter, the prelude to the Ragnarök, and in related mythic traditions.”FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactAn Introduction to the Committee on Degrees in Folklore & MythologyThe concentration in Folklore and Mythology is a liberal education in itself, and although most graduates of the program go on to successful careers in medicine, law, business, journalism, and other pursuits, an unusually large number of our alumni and alumnae teach and conduct research in a variety of academic departments. This concentration focuses on the study of society, past or present, through its cultural documents and artifacts, and uses a variety of methodologies drawn from the humanities and social sciences. To concentrate on a society’s folklore and mythology (on sub-national as well as national levels) is to understand its traditional self-definition through its epics, ballads, folktales, legends, beliefs, and other cultural phenomena, including music, song, and dance, and studying a group’s folklore shows how it identifies itself in relation to other groups.Concentrators conduct independent research on folklore and mythology in a variety of cultures including, for example, African, American, Chinese, Celtic, English, Greek, German, Japanese, Sanskrit & Indian Studies, Scandinavian, and Slavic. Founded in 1967 and the oldest undergraduate degree program in the field in this country, Folklore and Mythology at Harvard has produced many distinguished graduates. Students often form mutually supportive groups; student-faculty contact is by tradition — and structure — very close; and collegiality within the program is highly valued.Three central courses of the Concentration (Culture and Belief 16, formerly Folklore and Mythology 100; 97; and 98a) provide an introduction to the field of folkloristics, general knowledge of the theories and methods of the field, as well as a survey of ethnographic field methods and ethnological methodology. Three more courses from among the Folklore and Mythology offerings (e.g., Witchcraft, Swahili Women Storytellers, African Folklore in the New World, Legend, Myth, Dance as a Site of Cultural and Personal Meaning, The Mythic Imagination) round out the core folklore courses.In addition to this central core, each concentrator selects a Special Field. Roughly speaking, these fields fall into those that are grounded in a particular culture or language (such as African, Celtic, Classics, English and American, German, Near Eastern, Sanskrit and Indian Studies) and those that are not (such as Anthropology, Linguistics, Psychology, Sociology, Ethnomusicology, Performance). Concentrators gain in-depth knowledge of the Special Field by taking at least five half-courses in it. The second half of the Junior tutorial (98b) investigates areas for research at the intersection of the Special Field and folklore proper. The senior tutorial is devoted to the honors thesis required of all concentrators.The dual structure of the Concentration, together with the unique position of folklore studies between the humanities and the social sciences, offers students an insurance policy against parochialism, while at the same time guaranteeing a deep and certain grasp of a traditional discipline. The original faculty legislation founding the program charged that candidates be prepared to do graduate work in the departments represented by their Special Field, as well as in Folklore and Mythology. In fact, our graduates have, over the years, exercised not only those alternatives, but have, like most graduates of the College, gone on to careers in law, business, medicine, and a variety of other professions, including journalism and film.No special background is required for any Folklore and Mythology course, but good general preparation in languages, literature, history, and expository writing will be advantageous. Our Concentration strongly recommends proficiency in a language other than English, equivalent to that acquired by two years of college study. Generally, languages are very important to advanced work in folklore and in the Special Fields, and prospective concentrators are urged to look to language preparation in high school and from the beginning of their freshman year. In some of our Special Fields, language study may be counted toward concentration.All potential concentrators should make an appointment with the Head Tutor to discuss Special Field options and suggested courses, by the first Friday in April.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

	Description: Human imagination has conjured two enduring mythic characters that create habitable worlds for people in stories from cultures all over the world. Sometimes branded Hero, sometimes Trickster, these two share traits and antics, yet they seem to endorse fundamentally different values. This seminar examines both hero and trickster in several cultural contexts, comparing them with each other and with their correlates worldwide, primarily in oral traditions, but also where each has migrated to other media.

	Description: Mercury, Hermes, or quicksilver has seeped into the psyches of philosophers and emperors, mad-hatters, sushi-eaters and cavity-fillers. It can “move” through the body, passing the blood-brain barrier, swim through amniotic fluid, and change the body chemistry of all living organisms. Concentrating on mercury and environmental contaminants, this course places a particular focus on the effects of heavy metals on climate change, environmental racism, and human health. With global contamination levels rising, the United Nations Environment Programme convened the 2013 Minamata Convention. The subsequent treaty aims to reduce human and environmental exposure, by eliminating the heavy metal from pesticides, gold mining, pharmaceuticals, and factory emissions.  Some regions of the world lend themselves to specific kinds of analysis and interventions. From the Amazon to the Arctic and Antarctic, mercury pollution in particular has alarmed environmental engineers and social scientists. While quicksilver’s effects on the landscape have marked visibility, its impact on human health is not always so easily detected, except in fetal development. Through the figures of the mother-and-child and of nature’s body - often gendered female, public health officials and environmental scientists, call for eliminating the mercurial “body burden” placed on human and nonhuman bodies, for a less toxic future.

	 

	 

	On the Road: Traffic, Migrations, and Other Sorts of (Im)MobilitiesFOLKMYTH 156Ruth Goldstein2017 FallMonday, 02:00pm - 03:59pmLocation: Sever Hall 106Class Number: 16821 Course ID: 203876 Class Capacity: 18  Consent Required: Instructor

	Description: 

	The current global moment carries the mark of border-crossings and transgressions where not only people are on the move, but also ideas and images about them. The refugee, the migrant, and the terrorist - while itinerant figures of different orders - they all inspire particular narratives about what constitutes "human nature" and inhumane practices. This course explores the multiple meanings of mobility and stasis by examining the (dis)placement and circulation of people and things along with the (folk)tales that accompany "being on the road."  New roads through rainforests can bring improved economic conditions to rural areas; they can also bring disease and environmental destruction. So-called "uncontacted" tribes still inhabit in parts of the Amazon rainforest and Bedouin tribes continue to trouble Middle Eastern states. These nomadic populations present a challenge to state politicians, in theory because they represent a nomadic legacy and the possibility of insurrection, along with the belief that they cannot coexist with the modern, fixed, nation-state. French thinkers Deleuze & Guattari write that "[h]istory is always written from the sedentary point of view and in the name of a unitary State apparatus, at least a possible one, even when the topic is nomads. What is lacking is a Nomadology, the opposite of a history." So what does a mobile history or global outlook sound like if not told from the sedentary point of view? How do our perspectives on movement inform notions (or realizations) of peace, war, progress, and development? And what does it mean to tell a tale in motion?  From the side of the road and on the highway, who and what can move or stay -- as well as who can tell the tale -- has defined those people and things gain and maintain social value. Among the diverse array of authors and central figures for this course are: Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Miriam Camitta, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Jodi Byrd, as well as historically heroic actors such as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass. We will also honor the thousands of unnamed refugees crossing state borders via land, air, and water every day. While the course has a focus on the Americas, Africa, (some readings on South East Asia) and European colonialism, the class discussions, presentations, and certainly the assignments provide space to examine migrations and mobilities on the global scale.

	Readings and discussions will engage the topics of: spatial productions of power and knowledge-making; movement that occurs through terrestrial, aquatic, cyber and outer-space, border-crossings; disability studies; trans-national development projects and environmental disasters; nomads and refugees.

	 

	Notes: This course fulfills the Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights requirements for a secondary field.

	Description: Are quilts the great American (folk) art? From intricately stitched whole-cloth quilts, to the improvisational patchworks of Gee's Bend; from the graphic simplicity of Amish quilts to the cozy pastels of depression-era quilts; from the Aids Quilt to art quilts; quilts have taken on extraordinary significance in American culture. This class surveys the evolution of quilt-making as a social practice, considering the role of quilts in articulations of gender, ethnic, class and religious identities, and their positions within discourses of domesticity, technology, consumerism, and cultural hierarchy.

	Description: In January 2017, the Pussy Hat Project turned the Women’s March on Washington into an eye-catching “sea of pink,” but this is not the first time that needlework has played an important role in a political demonstration. Needlework’s traditional associations with femininity and domesticity have made it a potent symbol in protests that are critical of traditional gender roles, or that evoke domestic morality to challenge public policy, or in some cases, both. In addition to the 2017 Pussy Hat project, we will look at cases like the ongoing NAMES Project AIDS memorial quilt, and the anti-nuclear-arms Piece Ribbon project of the mid-1980s within broader historical and theoretical contexts of needlework, of protest and demonstration, and of collective and/or community-building artistic practices.

    Contact Above: in 2014, Devi Lockwood ’14 rode her bicycle from Memphis TN to New Orleans LA on the Mississippi River Trail. The goal of her trip was to meet as many people as possible and collect stories for her senior thesis. On the left: after a 30-mile ride, a stop outside Clarksdale, MS, to visit the site of Blues legend Muddy Waters’ house.  On the right: on the banks of the Mississippi at Memphis, along with Meredith Keffer ’12 (left) and Caroline Lowe ’12 (middle), also Folklore & Mythology concentrators, and traveling companions for part of the trip.  Post-graduation, Meredith worked at the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey as the Assistant to the Artistic Director.  Caroline taught American History at the High Mountain Institute in Leadville, CO, and went on to tutor and be a media coordinator for Epidemic Answers.  She is now at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.  Hear about what some of our alumni have done after graduation! (In order by graduation year.) Sarah Burke (2005) - The definition of my undergraduate course changed a few times. But I think I can safely say that I studied the medieval Mediterranean, with an emphasis on religion. My thesis was about the translation of a (lost) Muslim mystical text into Latin in medieval Spain. It was probably over-ambitious in scope, but writing it was very rewarding. After graduation I traveled for a year on one of Harvard's traveling fellowships. My project was officially to study apiculture (beekeeping) in the Mediterranean. I started off spending a few months in Malta, the bullseye of the Mediterranean, where I immersed myself in the small and hyper-competitive world of Maltese beekeepers. Lots of ethnographic techniques – asking questions, buying alcohol (thanks, Harvard!) – came in handy there. I learned about different forms of hives from a number of eccentric men, and one woman, and got particularly fascinated with how the vocabulary of beekeeping matched up with Malta's particular form of xenophobia (lots of disparaging comments made about aggressive "black bees" which supposedly come from one of several countries that also send many il/legal immigrants to Malta). I never wrote about this (probably because it all happened so close to when I finished my undergrad thesis) so it's up for grabs… I learned about beekeeping in Sicily, too. Then I went to Slovenia for the winter months where I traveled around looking at painted beehive panels, a folk art peculiar to Slovenia. By then I had kind of burned out on bees… I found myself wandering the great museums of Europe looking closely at still lifes to see if the painter had included a bee on any of the flowers. I also looked at bees on coins in Italy and Turkey, and drank lots of warm honey wine in Munich. Then I gave bees a pass altogether and traveled in Tunisia for a month with the famous Marcel Q. Laflamme ('05). I went immediately from there to a convent in Italy where the nuns (wait for it…) keep bees. I stayed there for a month and thought about Catholicism a lot. It was Easter. Then I took trains and buses from Munich to Beijing. Then I took trains from LA to Boston.Last year I received an MA in medieval art from the Courtauld Institute in London. Besides occasionally feeling like an anthropologist doing fieldwork on the English upper classes, I also used Folk & Myth to analyze things like the way stories moved from an oral tradition to a literary form to a stained glass window. I thought a lot about how seeing the same thing repeatedly can codify it, and how decoration can contribute to a ceremony. My thesis was about a group of liturgical scrolls used to bless the Paschal Candle, and about the manufacture and meaning of candles in the M. Ages (beeswax was one of the priciest commodities… and don't even get me started about how Christ was born to a virgin and bees were considered to regenerate without sex, because that will get me going on wax as flesh substitute and the burning of the candle as fleshly sacrifice…).Now I'm studying library science at Simmons in Boston. I hope to work with medieval manuscripts again in the future, in a special collection or a museum. I am also thinking about museum archives as a career path. I tutor several elementary and junior high school kids to pay my rent. And I have an internship in the archive of the Blaschka glass flowers collection at Harvard. My only question is, do glass flowers need glass bees? Emma Firestone (2005) - Gee, in some ways my post-Harvard doings appear uncharitable indeed to my F&M roots (but see below!!!); because, after all those mighty undergraduate labours, I decided that what I really wanted to do was ... get another BA. English was my special field and I had grandiose notions of carrying on as an English academic from at least my sophomore year; but F&M was my temperamental and spiritual as well as my academic home, and I was perfectly happy to stick to a focused English curriculum that complemented my studies of 19th.c mythography, etc. After graduation, though, I went off to Cambridge U, stocked up on all the monuments of Medieval and Renaissance verse, and commenced a hairbrained rabid dash through their undergraduate English curriculum, finishing the whole thing in 2 years. The schedule was ludicrously demanding, but it was also a thrill, an invaluable survey -- and a proper introduction to Shakespeare, with whom I now hope to form some sort of long-term professional relationship. Oh, and it brought me to Pembroke College, for which I have come to feel something that approximates the love I still feel for Warren House and all its inhabitants. With all luck, I'll start my Ph.d in Shakespeare and performance studies at Cambridge in the fall. The initial research and process of applying showed me once again that F&M remains, without question, my intellectual anchor and sail. The syllabus I submitted was mostly cribbed from a 104 unit on phenomenology and performance. More importantly (but maybe more ineffably), I would like to think that F&M's warmth and particular, accommodating humanism somehow permeates my sane-r research efforts.Oh, and in the meantime I'm in a waffl-y, between-meals sort of period... spent the fall studying Japanese in Tokyo, where Pembroke has a sister-school of sorts. Now I'm back in England blundering around, waitressing and copy-editing and things like that. I also write dance reviews for an online magazine. This is a costly amateur interest, but I'm confident that they'll start paying my London travel expenses within 1-2 years.Okay, so now I've taken the largest amount of space of anyone to inform you that all I have done is stay in college. Typical. But hey, it's been really wonderful to hear from all of you. If any of you come to Cambridge/England, please feel free to get in touch with me; if we can't meet up, I'll at least try to direct you someplace nice to eat. Kaitlin Heller (2005) - Five years ago, I matriculated into Cambridge University's M.Phil. program in medieval history. My focus at Harvard had been medieval folklore, and I was pleased to find my undergraduate work better than simply useful: rather, it put me well ahead of the game. Not only did my knowledge of a wide array of methodologies enable me to incorporate disparate sources into my master's thesis, my background in medieval folklore proved to be precisely the foundation I needed to work on the wondrous and perplexing Otia Imperialia of Gervase of Tilbury, to which I was pointed by the inimitable Dr. Carl Watkins, for whose supervision I remain immensely grateful. Still, after a year of intense research, coursework, and exams, and at the tender age of twenty-three, I began to feel I needed a break from the academic world. Upon completing my degree, I moved to New York and began, as they say, pounding the pavement, looking for a job in publishing. I spent a brief interlude at the prestigious literary agency Zachary Shuster Harmsworth, working as the agency assistant, and then landed what was for me a dream job: Del Rey Books, the science fiction and fantasy imprint of the Random House Publishing Group, hired me on.  I had a wonderful three years working at Del Rey. The other editors tolerated my eternal fascination with folklore and history admirably, and if they occasionally mocked me for nattering on about the correct etymology of an Old Norse word being misapplied in a fantasy novel--well, it was perhaps no more than I deserved. But I spent those three years thinking all the time about history and about the medieval world, keeping up with the field, and presenting at conferences. Eventually I knew I had to come back, for good. Five years after my graduation, I have the great good fortune of preparing to enter a doctoral program in medieval history at the University of Toronto. I am not insensible that I owe this to my work at Harvard and Cambridge, and to the brilliant people there who educated me, wrote me letters, and encouraged me to tackle--and surmount--challenges I might otherwise never have attempted. I hope that the program in Folklore and Mythology continues to flourish.  Amber Rose (2004) - After graduating in '04 (special field Celtic and Scandinavian) I stuck around Harvard for a year working at Widener; then I decided I wasn't ready for a 9-5 yet and went back to school. I got an MPhil in Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Celtic at Cambridge University, then decided school wasn't for me either. So now I'm working as an editor at a tiny publishing house of illustrated nonfiction (that is, coffee table books). I'm also trying to find my writer's voice, which I've found to be about as easy as juggling cats. My name is Paul Hersh, class of 2004, special field in religion. After college I lived in Alaska for a year as a Sales & Marketing Intern at the Alaska SeaLife Center, then I moved to New Zealand for 2+ years where I worked as Marketing Coordinator for the Auckland symphony. After that I moved to Singapore to be a speech writer for the President of the National University of Singapore (where I'm at now), but the Pres just took a job as the first President of a new university in Saudi Arabia so I've been travelling all over the world with him for meetings with nobel laureates and deans and presidents of other universities and later this year I'll be moving to Saudi Arabia to work at the new university.  Alison Kent (1999) - I wrote my thesis on the symbolism and folklore surrounding an indigneous movement in Bolivia--and after graduation, I returned to Bolivia on a Fulbright to research Afro-Bolivian identity and culture in a tiny town in the Yungas region called Chicaloma. I ended up staying in Bolivia for almost two years, on the Fulbright and then consulting for a public health NGO. I loved it there, and return to Chicaloma whenever I can. It's been so gratifying and fascinating to watch the Bolivian political scene evolve--and an indigenous man become President!--since my time researching the mobilization of indigenous movements there. A lot of potent ethnic symbolism was involved! I returned to the US in 2001 and worked for almost three years for the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, a small human rights NGO, primarily working with indigneous and women's rights groups in Guatemala and southern Mexico. I then went to law school at the Univ. of Michigan, spending a summer in Sierra Leone, and just became an attorney. I'm clerking for a federal judge in Boston now, working on a range of cases, from suits against the FBI based on the Whitey Bulger murders to much more mundane disputes between companies. After my clerkship, I'm heading back overseas and hope to do human rights/refugee/rule of law work long-term; it looks like I'll be based in Kampala, Uganda as of fall 2008.Without a doubt, my folk and myth degree has helped me, especially in my work in the field. In Sierra Leone, I worked in a rural area helping to train paralegals to take on civil and criminal cases under the customary law system, which functions seperately from the Western-based legal system which is only in the capital. I wrote a law journal article about the internalization of human rights norms there when I returned, and I used case studies of stories of the different clients we'd assisted to illustrate--I felt like I was back writing a folk and myth paper for Deborah. What I learned from folk and myth has been a huge asset, especially what I learned doing my thesis field research in Bolivia. I'm incredibly grateful for such good preparation--it might sound strange coming from an attorney, but it's the truth. Rebecca Nesson (1998) - I wish I could more clearly connect what I'm doing now to my Folk and Myth background because I loved (and still love Folk & Myth). I graduated in 98 after studying American women's folklore and writing a thesis about the stories women tell each other about oral sex. My timing was interesting vis a vis Lewinsky. I went directly to Harvard Law School after graduating because I wasn't sure what else to do. That is not a good reason to go to law school, it turns out. Although I finished, I don't practice law now. While there I got interested in Internet technology and computing and started studying computer science. I'm now about one year away (I hope) from completing my Ph.D. in computer science. Lately I've spent a lot of my time working on using 3D virtual worlds (such as Second Life) for education and I talked a bit about the role of female avatars in Second Life at a recent F&M symposium.   Louis Monoyudis (1998) - After graduating in '98 I worked in the ultimate world of tale telling and fantasy: advertising at Leo Burnett in Chicago. While there focused on brand strategy and applied several ethnographic techniques to interview the public to create psychographic profiles. Yeah, it was kind of as gross as it sounds.But, let's be honest, it was glamorous, the travel was fab and the expense accounts were fierce! Oh, the dotcom days...The upshot of that experience was the realization that instead of telling people what to buy, I want to tell people what to wear. Never knew just how bossy I am!Thus, moved to NYC and studied fashion design at Parsons. Since then have worked as a menswear designer for John Bartlett, John Varvatos and, my current post, Calvin Klein. Every season we research the trends, pick color and fabrics, sketch the silhouettes and work on models to get the perfect fit.From this experience I was able to present at last year's FM Symposium (2007) about the appropriation of male archetypes such as the rocker, the cowboy, etc. in men's fashion.In addition, have been moonlighting as a freelance writer for the daily paper Metro focusing on Pulitzer Prize worthy topics such as which gay bar in the city has the hottest go-go boys (Boysroom) and if men in Chelsea are too self-conscious about the size of their pecs (yes, a disorder called male body dysmorphia). Check out some coverage of NY Fashion Week (attached).From that was tapped to work on a music website, www.riffin.com, and I am now the Editor in Chief with a team of writers who contribute content on a range of topics from interviews with musicians such as Chemical Brothers to music-based fashion trends such as Japan's Visual Kei.Check it out:Chemical BrothersVisual Kei Sara Berliner (1998) - I graduated alongside Becca in ‘98 (special field: VES) and would make the case that her work on virtual worlds connects pretty directly with Folk & Myth.  Our online lives are the stories we get to tell about ourselves  — to communities both pre-existing and formed anew — often to anyone that’ll listen.After building a freelance career across disciplines (ethnography on public housing for the Field Museum of Chicago, directing/performing in puppet theater, putting together orchestras for pop and opera stars on tour) I co-founded Star Farm in 2002 (www.starfarmproductions.com).  Our mission is to tell great stories for kids across media.  It’s been a DIY business school degree, a wild and sometimes heartbreaking 5 1/2 years, but a fantastic creative challenge, and an intense and rewarding collaborative process.  We’ve got 4 book series either in stores or launching this year, a cartoon on the Nicktoons Network, a thriving online community (www.EdgarAndEllen.com), a board game, jigsaw puzzle, DVD, etc.  We believe in never telling the same story twice (e.g. adapting a novel into a film) because it’s more fun, for us and for the audience, to always get a new piece of the story arc or world.We started with "Edgar & Ellen", for ages 6-12, about mischievous twins pranking the status quo in a saccharine-sweet town.  Next up is "The Kinetics", our first preschool project, about superheroes who save the neighborhood one dance move at a time (), and for all you fantasy/sci-fi fans, "Kaimira" (turn up your sound), a five-book series from Cambridge’s own Candlewick Press.  Little, Brown will publish the first book in our teen supernatural horror series, Devouring, in the fall.  Each will have an age-appropriate online strategy, ranging from an activity-filled marquee site to a multiplayer game to a plot-based ARG (alternate reality game).As you can imagine, I tap into my F&M background on a daily basis.  Deborah and Steve certainly informed my worldview.  People used to ask me what I’d do with my degree, but they don’t anymore.  Somehow even my personal life dovetailed nicely — my husband’s first name is Ulysses! Montana Miller (1996) - I ended up here in spectacularly flat Ohio, a far cry from my days of high-flying adventures and big-city excitement. After Harvard, I continued to work as a professional high diver in theme parks (Dutch Wonderland in Lancaster PA and other such weirdly offensive cultural tourist traps), diving from an 80-foot perch into an 8-foot pool. Quickly realizing that even when you do this correctly it hurts like hell and that I would soon be addicted to painkillers like all my high diving teammates, I applied to graduate school and went to get my M.A and Ph.D. in Folklore at UCLA. I never would have known they even had a program without Deborah's sending me in that direction, and she was right--it was perfect for me. I was able to spend the next 6 years thoroughly enjoying grad school (FAR less painful than trapeze and high diving) while continuing to perform my aerial act in all kinds of cool venues in L.A. (art galleries, awards shows, raves, political events, even a musical comedy created  by a bunch of Harvard alumni!).Someone else mentioned how people laugh when they see her Harvard diploma with Folklore and Mythology on it--well, I now also have the Ph.D. diploma, and to make it even more perplexing to visitors, it has Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature across it! (He became governor of California the semester I graduated.)After a year and a half of very discouraging job searching, through which Deborah provided countless recommendations and steady encouragement, I finally got lucky -- Bowling Green State University's Department of Popular Culture had a position for someone specializing in youth culture. Having written my dissertation on a drunk driving prevention program in high schools (a folk drama full of symbolism and theatrics), I fit the bill, and came here to join this small department where I teach both undergrads and grad students. I get to design my own courses, which is wonderful--among other things, I teach Youth and Popular Culture, Internet Communities, Occupational Folklore, and Health, Illness, Addiction, and Culture. I absolutely love the job, but can't keep up with all the demands--publishing my research is my biggest struggle. I serve on the Human Subjects Review Board here, which I love because qualitative research ethics is one of my major interests, ever since being Deborah's student in Fieldwork. I'm one of the few "qualitative" people on the board, and one of my roles is to teach the other members about the new world of Internet research, as we're seeing more and more applications that involve studies of Internet behavior and culture.I've never been so happy in my personal and professional life, and I count my blessings every day, even though I am homesick for the East Coast and I still have pangs of longing for my aerial acrobatic career!  Nathan Lump (1996) - After graduating way back when ('96), I spent a year doing silly jobs in New York -- I wrote copy for the J.Crew catalog ("taking it easy... in buttery cashmere, corduroy"), then press releases about romance novels at Simon & Schuster ("Jayne Ann Krentz does it again, with a tale of intrigue... and passion!") -- which was really meant to be a break from school before heading somewhere to start a Ph.D. program. But in many ways I fell in love with the city and my life here, and decided maybe I just hadn't hit upon the right thing. Taking a cue from my friend Eleni, and remembering the fun I'd had as an editor at Let's Go, I tried to get into magazines, and landed an editorial assistant job at Condé Nast Traveler, the upscale travel mag. Which started me on a new path entirely.Moved up the ranks at CNT, did a stint at SmartMoney magazine (during the dot-com boom: money was culture!), then spent several years at Travel + Leisure, and today I'm the editor of T: Travel, the travel magazine of The New York Times (f.k.a. The Sophisticated Traveler, now part of the Times's T family of "style" magazines). As others have suggested, to me F&M was the perfect training for what I do -- it made me sensitive to the stories we choose to tell, and how we translate experience into meaningful narrative, and how we can refine a sense of self from our encounters with foreignness, difference. Today when I work with great writers to develop pieces -- and write myself about all the amazing places I've been (Patagonia, southern Africa, Greenland, India, etc.) -- I know my sensibility, my wish to explore bigger ideas about how we relate, as individuals and collectively, to the dynamism of our world, has been shaped significantly by my time at Harvard in F&M. Adam Holland (1994) - After graduating, with a special field in social anthropology, I immediately began training full time for the US Olympic rowing team. I did that for 10 years, retiring form international competition in 2004 after Olympic trials. I was on the Olympic team in 1996, and was second at US trials (which means no Olympic team) by tenths of a second in 2000 and in 2004.During that time I was, variously, taking classes part time, assistant coaching crew at Harvard, and working for four years in the Home Depot electrical department as part of the Olympic Job Opportunities program.I taught middle school English and American History for a year in 2004-2005, and then began coaching at a school in Cambridge. I coached six teams there for two years. I was an assistant coach for Middle School soccer, JV soccer, and varsity wrestling, and the head coach for MS wrestling, MS crew and varsity crew.I started law school this year at BU, but am still coaching wrestling and crew. I'm also trying (fitfully) to write a science fiction novel. Henry Bial (1992) - I guess I'm one of the folks who has stayed more or less "in field." I graduated in the class of '92 with an emphasis on US pop culture. I was a little ahead of the curve on that -- my thesis, "Myth and Meaning in American Automobile Model Names," was accepted, but just barely. After a couple of years coaching college tennis, I went back to grad school for an MA and PhD in Performance Studies at NYU, where I was able to combine my formal F&M training with the interest in theatre that sometimes kept me from doing my F&M homework. I completed my dissertation under the direction of Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett in 2001 and subsequently taught theatre and performance studies at the University of New Mexico for four years. Since 2005 I have been teaching and directing the doctoral program in Theatre and Film here at the University of Kansas. My course rotation includes classes on pop culture and ritual, as well as more conventional theatre. So while I would not call myself a "folklorist," I often find myself lecturing on material I first studied with Joe Harris, Steve Mitchell, and Deborah Foster among others. I've published an authored book, Acting Jewish: Negotiating Ethnicity on the American Stage and Screen (U of Michigan Press, 2005) and edited a collection called The Performance Studies Reader (Routledge, 2004; 2nd Ed. 2007) that includes contributions from several folklorists as well as theatre scholars, philosophers, etc.  Josh Solomon (1990) - After writing my thesis on the burakumin caste of Japan, I ended staying in Japan off and on for most of the 90's, working as a teacher in the JET Program in Kyushu and eventually working in finance at Chase Bank in Tokyo and New York. I decided to return to a career in education. I returned to New York for good in 1999 and became a math and Japanese teacher in the NYC school system. I am now a principal of a new public high school in Manhattan called Business of Sports School (nycBOSS.org). In May 2010, I earned my doctorate in education (Ed.D.) at Columbia Univ. Teachers College, writing my dissertation on training urban school principals using internships. Katie Orenstein (1990) - After graduating, I traveled to Haiti to study folklore on a Peabody-Gardner grant from Harvard – but since there was a very dramatic election and a violent coup shortly after, instead of studying folklore I ended up becoming a journalist, with a focus on human rights  - I also consulted for the UN and for the (democratically elected) government of Haiti in 95 and 96. Then, about 10 years ago  I returned to the states and turned what had been my senior thesis for Folk & Myth into a book – “Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale.” It follows the story over 500 years and across genres and continents, and it’s about how the stories that we tell, and those that are told about us, shape our lives. It’s also an attempt to debunk the idea that stories about men are epic, and stories about women are not. It did pretty well – some of it was excerpted in op-ed pieces that ran in the NYT, and there were even some meetings about a TV miniseries idea based on it for HBO, which was exciting, but went, uh, nowhere. (Anyone know anything about TV limbo?) More recently, I have been writing  and teaching writing – specifically, for the last couple of years I’ve been spearheading a project  with a think tank I am affiliated with to target and train women experts across the nation to write for the op-ed pages of major newspapers, which are currently overwhelmingly dominated by male voices.    There’s info on the project on my website, for anyone curious.   One more funny thing – I recently gave an interview about my career to an organization called “career peeks”, and reviewing the interview I felt that actually for the first time I saw how Folk & Myth had played a great part of shaping my career –   because most of my career has been around the power of narrative to shape our lives, and the power of owning your  own narrative.   My book was grounded in that idea, but also the kind of journalism I do (I think journalism and folklore as closer than most people think), the op-ed project I run, even the literacy class that I teach.

    ContactThe formal awarding of degrees in Folklore and Mythology at Harvard dates to 7 March 1967, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously voted in favor of a motion to establish the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, the oldest American undergraduate degree program of its kind. (1) Those who proposed and spoke in favor of the founding of the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology at that meeting were Albert B. Lord, Charles Dunn, and Einar Haugen, who also served on the committee in its early years, as did, for example, Frank Cross, Daniel Ingalls, David Maybury-Lewis, David McClellan, Rulan Chao Pian, Eileen Southern, Evon Vogt, John Ward and Cedric Whitman. In broader terms, however, Harvard’s long engagement with the study of oral literature, of epics and ballads, cosmological and other mythic narratives, popular culture, traditional belief systems and all the many forms of expressive manifestation of culture that constitute the study of folklore and mythology goes back much, much further. And, in fact, there is a direct line that leads from the current generation of Harvard scholars in this field back to that group of distinguished faculty who fashioned the committee, and from them, even further back into the early 1800s; indeed, many of the most storied figures in the history of the University’s commitment to the humanities and interpretive social sciences worked in these fields, among others, Milman Parry, Clyde Kluckhohn, Fred Norris Robinson, George Lyman Kittredge, Francis James Child, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. (2)Indeed, it is anything but accidental that the founding of the American Folklore Society, the key professional association in the field in the US, took place at Harvard in the Faculty Room of University Hall on 4 January 1888. (3) When some eight decades later, in that same room, the Faculty voted to establish a committee to oversee the awarding of degrees in the field, it was noted that the proposed concentration would be both truly interdisciplinary and would "draw strength from the possibility of designing a wide variety of individual course programs and from the provision of tutorial." That foresighted foundation of the program, based on rigorous methodological training combined with flexible and sympathetic attention to the individual student’s intellectual interests, has proved to be a remarkably durable and successful recipe for the lives and careers of the program’s students. Many of our undergraduates have gone on to take advanced degrees in the many fields for which “Folk & Myth” prepares them and have had outstanding careers in the academy; at the same time, as with all concentrations, the overwhelming majority of former students have had rewarding careers in such disparate fields as medicine, law, business, politics, finance, media, the performing arts, and journalism.   (1) Attached please find a facsimile of the minutes of the 7 March 1967 FAS meeting.(2) This branch of Harvard tradition is detailed in David E.

    ContactAn adviser can play a variety of roles in your work on the thesis. It may be more important to find someone who fulfills the roles that are essential to you than to have an adviser who is the leading light in his or her field. Among the roles an adviser can play are:The Expert: As an expert in your area, an adviser can be a tremendous resource. He or she can provide you with valuable bibliographic references and offer insight into how your topic fits in the larger body of scholarship. Also, your adviser’s intuition may allow you to discern which of your more unusual ideas are potentially productive.The Taskmaster: Pacing your work is an important aspect of the thesis project. As well as observing official deadlines, you will have to set unofficial ones. An adviser who insists on setting and meeting strict deadlines can provide the necessary motivation for students who have a hard time keeping up.The Editor: Some students prefer to have an adviser who is unobtrusive when it comes to deadlines and ideas, but is willing to spend considerable time on style and the mechanics of writing.The Critic: Your adviser can offer constant challenges to your ideas, in an attempt to encourage you to think through every detail of your argument. His or her critical perspective can help you to determine the extent of your progress.When you begin thinking about your topic, spend sometime talking with seniors who are writing theses. They will be able to give you an idea about what combination of roles their advisers fulfill. This information will be invaluable as you consider possible advisers. Once you have determined your chosen area of interest, consultations with faculty will enable you to refine your ideas and to initiate the search for an adviser. Your meetings with them will give you an opportunity to judge how well they might be able to respond to your plans and needs. If a faculty member appears interested in your project and seems to possess the combinations of skills you seek in adviser, simply ask if he or she is available.MANAGING THE PROJECTThe importance of organization in your work on the thesis cannot be overemphasized.Once you have an adviser, sit down with him or her and map out a timetable. Good long-range planning is vital in grappling with such a large project, especially since you are unlikely to have had any experience with a similar endeavor. Your own plans should include developing a good relationship with your adviser. As in any working relationship, communication is the key to productivity.Try to schedule regular meetings with your adviser and do all that you can to make them substantive. The frequency of your meetings will doubtless vary of the course of the semester. Most students meet more often with their advisers once they have begun writing.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactA thesis topic must spring from your own energies and interests. The first step toward defining a topic, then, is to determine your primary areas of interest. The role of self-examination in this process is critical. Look over your past work in the Folklore and Mythology program and your special field and attempt to discover a few general areas of interest. What courses have you taken? What have you written about in course papers? Also, think about why you decided to concentrate in Folklore and Mythology. As you consider these and other similar questions, you will begin to discern certain patterns or trends in your work. Contemplation of these issues will allow you to define your general areas of interest.Finding a topic within an area of interest is more difficult. A topic is best formulated as a question. But the questions cannot be too broad, for a topic must have focus. Nor can it be too narrow since the goal of a good thesis is to express thoughts of general importance through detailed analysis of a specific case or cases.Because the purpose of this process is to formulate a focused and thought-provoking question, the best way to uncover topics in your area of interest is to begin posing questions. Start with the issues that stand out in your mind. Also, read some scholarly literature on approaches you might take. If your topic seems too broad, this reading will give you some ideas on approaches you might take. If your question is too narrow, a selection of articles and books can lead you to the general concerns that relate to your interest. And remember, an undergraduate thesis need not be an original “contribution to knowledge.” More important is the sustained examination of a topic that engages you.If you are unsure about the viability of your topic, you might look at past theses in order to find out what types of projects have been the most successful. The best theses of each academic year are submitted to the Harvard University Archive, which is located on the first floor of Pusey Library. A list of selected honors theses from Folklore and Mythology is provided below, and many theses presented to the Committee are to be found in the Folklore and Mythology Library. FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

PatilLikely to be offered in 2017 SpringCourse ID: 123914Description: An exploration of love in five genres of classical South Asian literature$epic history, story literature, plays, poetic miniatures, and court poetry. We will pay particular attention to the nature of literary genres and practices and how they were theorized by South Asian intellectuals. Especially relevant are theories of poetic language, aestheticized emotion (especially love), and literary ornamentation.Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past. Ancient Fictions: The Ancient Novel in ContextAESTHINT 33David Elmer2015 FallMon/Wed, 11:00am - 11:59amClass Number: 14909  Course ID: 124912Description: The novel is often thought of as a distinctively modern form, but Greco-Roman antiquity had its own version. Fictional prose narratives about adventure and romance in exotic lands were immensely popular in antiquity. We will explore this tradition by reading the five surviving Greek novels, the Golden Ass of the Roman Apuleius, and selected other texts, along with works by contemporary theorists and critics. Topics include: definitions of the "novel"; ancient representations of desire; gender and class politics; relationships between secular and religious narratives.Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.  Buddhism and Japanese CultureAESTHINT 36Ryuichi Abe2016 SpringTues/Thurs, 02:00pm - 02:59pmClass Number: 13207  Course ID: 123913Description: This course is designed to enable students to analyze a wide range of Japanese cultural creations_including the traditional Noh theater, modern Japanese paintings, and contemporary anime_by illustrating the influence of Buddhism both on their forms and at their depths. The first part of the course is a study of major Buddhist philosophy and its impact on Japanese literature. The second part observes Buddhist ritual practices and their significance for Japanese performing arts. The last part traces the development of Japanese Buddhist art, and considers the influence of Buddhism on diverse contemporary popular Japanese art media. Afro-Latin America: History and CultureAFRAMER 124YAlejandro de la Fuente, Doris Sommer2016 SpringTuesday, 01:00pm - 02:59pmClass Number: 14785  Course ID: 159570Description: This course explores how African cultural expressions influenced colonial societies and later national cultures in Latin America. How did peoples of African descent shape the formation of Latin American national cultures in areas such as literature, religion, visual arts, music, dance, and cinema? Some scholars have debated whether African religious, musical, medical and communitarian practices were reproduced in the New World or whether they were creolized through fusion with other (European and indigenous) practices. Others have sought to explain how African cultural practices (music, religion, dances) that were derided as primitive and uncivilized in the early twentieth century became "nationalized" and transformed into key expressions of national cultures in many Latin American countries. What are the implications of this process for those cultural forms and their practitioners? How do they impact, if at all, other areas of social life?  We explore these questions through historical and literary texts, films, visual arts, and recordings.  [African Religions]AFRAMER 187Jacob OluponaLikely to be offered in 2016 FallCourse ID: 123438Description: This course is a basic introduction to the history and phenomenology of traditional religions of the African peoples. Using diverse methodological and theoretical approaches, the course will explore various forms of experiences and practices that provide a deep understanding and appreciation of the sacred meaning of African existence: myth, ritual arts, and symbols selected from West, East, Central, and Southern Africa.Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 3690. [Introduction to Mesopotamian Religion]ANE 102Piotr SteinkellerLikely to be offered in 2018 SpringCourse ID: 114298Description: A survey of the history and major concerns of ancient Mesopotamian religion from prehistoric times down to the reign of Alexander the Great. Among the topics treated are the key figures of the Sumero-Babylonian pantheon, the major mythological compositions (read in translation), personal religion, cosmogonies and theogonies, magic and divination, Mesopotamian temples, and cult and ritual. The course makes rich use of ancient iconography.Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 3661. [Maya Narratives: Gods, Lords, and Courts]ANTHRO 1158Likely to be offered in 2016 FallCourse ID: 128062Description: This course explores the continuing investigation of Classic Maya texts and images, and how new decipherments have changed our understanding of the ancient Maya world. The Classic Maya are the only Pre-Columbian civilization with a substantial corpus of inscriptions produced well before any contact with the Old World. Maya written and visual narratives reveal details of history and myth, life at the courts of lords and nobles, and religion and worldview. Their testimonies are often striking, unique, and hard to understand, but they are not mediated by non-indigenous interpreters and open a window into a world long gone. [Armenian Magical Texts]ARMEN 120James RussellLikely to be offered in 2018 SpringCourse ID: 124288Description: Armenian magical texts include codices, scrolls, and separately-printed saints' lives used for good or ill, containing magic squares and symbols, the latter mostly deriving from Islamic magic. The course will consider literary sources of magic texts (e.g., the prayer Havatov khostovanim, the meditations of Narek), parallel traditions (esp. Christian Ethiopia), and the consideration of the paintings in Armenian magical manuscripts from the standpoint of the genre of Outsider Art.Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 2200.  [The Hero of Irish Myth and Saga]CELTIC 101Likely to be offered in 2017 SpringCourse ID: 122419Description: A study of the ways in which the hero is represented in early Irish sources, especially in the saga literature. The texts reflect the ideology and concerns of a society which had been converted to Christianity, but continued to draw on its Indo-European and Celtic heritage. The biographies of the Ulster hero, Cú Chulainn, of his divine father, Lug, and of certain king-heroes are studied in depth. The wisdom literature, and archaeological and historical evidence will be taken into account. The Folklore of Gaelic IrelandCELTIC 105Natasha Sumner2016 SpringMon/Wed, 02:00pm - 02:59pmClass Number: 15731  Course ID: 160495Description: An introduction to the oral traditions of Gaelic Ireland, including tales and song.

'Finn MacCool' or 'Fionn mac Cumhaill'). Finn is variously portrayed as a hunter-warrior-seer and is the leader of the intrepid fíana war band. We survey this Fenian literature as it is presented to us by medieval and early modern Gaelic manuscript tradition. We also engage with the rich modern Fenian folklore of Ireland, Scotland, and Nova Scotia. This includes the study of important texts such as Acallam na Senórach ‘The Dialogue of the Ancients’ and Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne ‘The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Gráinne’. Additionally, we consider the international impact of the Fenian tradition by examining James Macpherson's infamous, eighteenth-century, English-language adaptations and the ensuing Ossian controversy.  All Gaelic texts are read in English translation. [The Gaelic World: 1100 - 1700]CELTIC 118Natasha SumnerLikely to be offered in 2016 FallCourse ID: 127370Description: An introduction to the history and culture of Gaelic Scotland and Ireland, with particular attention to contemporary sources, including Gaelic literary sources.

With the launching of the “Folklore Studies Movement” in the 1910s, Chinese intellectuals discovered new sources for defining their cultural identity in the songs, legends and customs of the countryside. Ever since then, different representations of folk culture have been enlisted to define modern life in China, from the appropriation of folklore to create a new literature and the critical study of Chinese society through the lens of folk narratives and beliefs, to the adaptation of folk culture for disseminating revolutionary politics. We will look at folklore itself, sources on the study of folk culture, and modern works of poetry, fiction, film and music to examine the influence of ideas about cultural authenticity on literature, social science and politics in China over the span of the last century. Images of Greek Myths in Classical AntiquityCLASARCH 149Adrian Staehli2015 FallThursday, 04:00pm - 05:59pmClass Number: 18104  Course ID: 160357  Class Capacity: 30  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: This seminar explores the visual "language" of the representation of Greek myths in various media—such as painted vases, sculpture, mosaics, wall paintings, and sarcophagi—from its emergence in Archaic Greece through the Hellenistic and Roman periods to Late Antiquity. Magicians, Healing Gods, and Holy MenCLS-STDY 113Gil Renberg2015 FallMon/Wed, 01:00pm - 01:59pmClass Number: 16137  Course ID: 160535Description: This course will examine magic, divination, and other unconventional religious phenomena in the Greco-Roman world by focusing on extraordinary practices and practitioners. The topics to be explored include soliciting curative dreams from the gods; employing protective magic to ward off disease and other dangerous forces; using aggressive forms of magic to ensnare the object of one’s sexual desires or harm one’s opponents; the rise of “holy men” believed to have supernatural powers; and attempting to foresee the future through astrology or various forms of divination. The sources for these phenomena, most of which are strikingly different from those typically encountered when studying the ancient world, provide fresh perspectives. Storytelling and Deceptive Narration at Rome and BeyondCLS-STDY 141Brigitte Libby2015 FallWednesday, 01:00pm - 02:59pmClass Number: 15793  Course ID: 159812Description: How do we make others believe us when we stretch the truth?

We will study how ancient authors manipulate our perception of the stories they tell and see how these techniques recur in modern examples. Topics include historical legend, love poetry, the courtroom strategy of Cicero, political propaganda in epic poetry, Aesopic fables, ghost stories, and the account of a man transformed into a donkey. We end with several modern short stories. Readings are in English. The Ancient Greek HeroCULTBLF 22Gregory Nagy2015 FallMon/Wed, 12:00pm - 12:59pmClass Number: 11966  Course ID: 113501Description: This course takes a close look at the human condition, as viewed through the lens of classical Greek civilization (and some modern comparanda).The readings, all in English translation, are the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, seven tragedies (Aeschylus' Oresteia Trilogy, Sophocles' two Oedipus dramas, and Euripides' Hippolytus and The Bacchic Women), and two dialogues of Plato (the Apology and the Phaedo, both centering on the last days of Socrates); also, selections from the dialogue On Heroes by an eminent thinker in the "second sophistic" movement, Philostratus.Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.  Classical MythologyCULTBLF 35Brigitte Libby2016 SpringTues/Thurs, 11:00am - 11:59amClass Number: 14844  Course ID: 126004Description: Incest and parricide, cannibalism and self-blinding: classical mythology has fascinated artists, writers, and thinkers throughout western civilization, and this course will serve as an introduction to this strange and brilliant world. We will move from the very first works of Greek literature through to the classic Greek tragedies and the Roman tales in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Along the way, we will confront the question of what "mythology" is and how it works, and we will discuss how these traditional stories changed over time to fit different cultural circumstances. We will also consider ancient rationalizations of myth, the relationship of myth and politics, and the reception of classical myth in the modern world.Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past. Old English: Beowulf and its ContextsENGLISH 103GJoey McMullen2016 SpringTues/Thurs, 11:30am - 12:59pmClass Number: 14483  Course ID: 130249Description: We will translate some of the most fascinating sections of Beowulf—from monster-slaying and heroic feats to pagan burials and betrayals—in order to learn what makes it an exceptional poem.

Based on storytelling traditions, a narrator shapes the story to reflect his or her own intentions, making it personally expressive as well as publicly meaningful to a particular audience. This seminar examines the nature of storytelling, its enduring appeal, and its ability to adapt to multiple technologies (print, film, internet). Participants engage in the storytelling process itself. Dead Cthulhu Waits Dreaming: H.P. Lovecraft and MythologyFRSEMR 34DJames Russell2015 FallWednesday, 02:00pm - 03:59pmClass Number: 16259  Course ID: 160202Class Capacity: 12  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: H.P. Lovecraft, the American writer of science fiction, horror, and fantasy, created a cosmology, a mythology,  and an alternative vision of life and reality so compelling that over the years some readers have come to believe that his invented Necronomicon is a real book (in the Widener stacks). Like his predecessor, Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraft lived and died without recognition in his own country: American culture then as now valued practicality and social engagement.  What is it, then, that captivates Lovecraftians? The seminar will explore the invention of personal mythologies, languages, and narratives of counter-realities by Lovecraft and other writers (including Poe, C.G. Jung, Ursula Le Guin, Colin Wilson, and Philip K. Dick) as ways of individuation, and of resistance to conformity, through creative imagination.    The Folklore of Gaelic ScotlandFRSEMR 34FNatasha Sumner2015 FallMonday, 02:30pm - 05:29pmClass Number: 16260  Course ID: 160204Class Capacity: 12  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: This course explores the ‘treasure house’ of Gaelic folklore recorded in the Highlands of Scotland since the nineteenth century. The international controversy over Macpherson’s 'Ossian' poems in the 1760s prompted interest in the Scottish Gaelic folklore from which they were adapted. Folklorists have since documented a wealth of orally recorded material, including tales of ancient heroes (e.g. Finn McCool) and beliefs in malevolent fairies, seal-people, dangerous water-horses, the evil eye and second sight. As we explore these fascinating topics, we will take into account international scholarly approaches to folklore. Course Notes: No knowledge of Scottish Gaelic is required for this course. The seminar will also include 'an end-of-term 'ceilidh", a traditional social gathering often involving song, dance, and/or storytelling. Comparative Historical MythologyFRSEMR 36SMichael Witzel2016 SpringClass Number: 16522  Course ID: 109498Class Capacity: 15  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: Deals with an innovative approach to comparative mythology by incorporating an historical approach, not by the commonly assumed archetypes or diffusion. Working backwards from our earliest written sources (Egypt, etc.), successively earlier stages are detected through repeated reconstructions. Recent developments in genetics, archaeology, linguistics support the proposed historical model that tentatively reaches back to the "African Eve." Testing the proposal offers a wide scope for students' participation and research in texts and in the sciences. Open to Freshmen only. Biopolitics and Vampire Aesthetics, 1716-2016GERMAN 170Nicole Suetterlin2016 SpringWed, 02:00pm - 03:59pmClass Number: 15769  Course ID: 156124Description: This course traces the infamous bloodsucker's bite-marks through major periods of European literature from the 18th century to the present, exploring how the notion of vampirism is inextricably linked with the emergence of what Michel Foucault has famously called `biopolitics' or 'bio-power'. Since the 18th century, institutions such as schools, clinics and prisons have exerted an increasing “hold over life” (Foucault), conditioning the ways in which we think and act. Why does the emergence of these modern institutions coincide precisely with the vampire's first appearance in European literature? Have the arts been defying the biopolitical hold over life by creating a vampiric aesthetics? We pursue these questions by engaging in a dialogue between literature, film, the natural sciences, and critical theory. Readings include canonical authors such as Goethe, Byron, Hoffmann, Baudelaire, Nietzsche, Stoker, Tawada.Course Notes: Readings and discussions in English. Open to freshmen with permission of the instructor.Homer: The OdysseyGREEK 115David Elmer2016 SpringMon/Wed/Fri, 01:00pm - 01:59pmClass Number: 14913  Course ID: 112212Description:Reading of substantial selections from the Odyssey with discussion of key themes and interpretive problems.

Graham, Stephanie Paulsell2016 FallClass Number: 10098  Course ID: 104279Description: This course will explore the pervasive themes of journey and quest in world literature with particular attention to their religious dimensions. Through direct encounter with imaginative literary works from a variety of contexts and genres, we will consider the relationship between interior journeys and journeys through an external landscape, home and exile, and the religious and literary dimensions of literature itself.

The birth of two children instead of one presents anomaly, in some traditions causing anxiety that can only be ritually resolved, or in others creating opportunity. Twins link worlds that single children cannot, or embody signs, auspicious or suspicious. How are "real" twins related to the divine twins of religion and myth, if they are at all?Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Divinity School 3310.

Storytelling is thus understood as a mode of social and political activity that involves a struggle between personal and collective representations of the "truth" and between unofficial and official versions of events. Through the close analysis of storytelling in a variety of situations, we will explore the ways in which the meaning of stories resides not in any ahistorical essence or internal logic, but emerges from the everyday human struggle to strike a balance between domains of experience that are, on the one hand, felt to belong to oneself or one's own kind, and, on the other, felt to be shared by or to belong to others.Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 3859. Old Norse Language, Literature, and Culture: The Viking LegacySCAND 160AStephen Mitchell2015 FallWednesday, 12:00pm - 01:59pmLocation: Warren 102 (FAS)Class Number: 12552  Course ID: 118050Class Capacity: 12  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: Introduction to the language and literary culture of medieval Scandinavia, emphasizing works treating the Viking Age and their valorization of an heroic ideal.

While the multiple storytelling traditions of the teller influence the content and form of the emergent tale, each narrator shapes the story to reflect his or her own intentions, making it personally expressive as well as publicly meaningful to a particular audience in a specific place and time. Drawing on scholarship of oral storytelling traditions and reading (in translation) myths, tales, legends, plays and other forms from several traditions, this seminar will examine the nature of storytelling, its enduring appeal, and its ability to adapt to multiple new platforms (stage, print, film, internet). Participants will engage in the storytelling process itself in order to understand better the interrelationship of structure, plot, character, imagery, rhythm, voice and gesture to the story as a whole in a variety of media, ranging from mime to video. Folklore and the Culture of ChildhoodFRSEMR 36JMaria Tatar2016 FallWednesday, 03:00pm - 04:59pmLocation: Warren House 102Class Number: 16259  Course ID: 160202Class Capacity: 12  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: This course begins by examining the stories of Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen and explores the migration of fairy tales into literary and cinematic cultures for adults and for children. From fairy tales we turn to fantasy literature and to the great counterfactuals in Other Worlds constructed for children. Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and Neil Gaiman's Ocean at the End of the Lane will guide us through our investigation of what Graham Greene called the "excitement and revelation" of books read in childhood.   Comparative Historical MythologyFRSEMR 36SMichael Witzel2016 FallThursday, 04:00pm - 05:59pmLocation: Barker Center 211Class Number: 16522  Course ID: 109498Class Capacity: 15  Consent Required: InstructorDescription: Deals with an innovative approach to comparative mythology by incorporating an historical approach, not by the commonly assumed archetypes or diffusion.

Students should meet with their tutors at the very beginning of the term to discuss the format, meeting schedule, syllabus and reading for the Tutorial. Students will be expected to write a substantial amount during the tutorial. Writing options may include several small papers, two or three medium length papers, or one long paper. A copy of the syllabus and one of the written works should be given to the Head Tutor’s office.Students should speak with the Head Tutor and/or his or her Special Field adviser before the term begins to identify an appropriate tutor.The Senior Tutorial for the Non-Thesis Capstone OptionDuring the senior year, we expect students concentrating in Folklore & Mythology to demonstrate their command of cultural theory an analysis.  In the capstone option, Folklore and Mythology 96r, such competence may be demonstrated through, for example, a performance, exhibit, or written analysis, usually in connection with specific Folklore and Mythology courses (or related courses approved by the Head Tutor). Please check back here soon for more detail about this option, which will become official for the 2011-2012 academic year.  Or, please arrange a meeting with Deborah Foster to discuss this developing option.The Senior Tutorial for the Senior ThesisThe Senior Thesis, Folklore and Mythology 99, is required of all concentrators and is regarded as a year-long opportunity to bring the theoretical concerns common to all folklorists together with the student’s own Special Field. In this section you will find specific information about the thesis for those writing in the Folklore and Mythology program (e.g., requirements, deadlines, etc.) and general advice about the thesis project for all Folklore and Mythology concentrators.Students seeking general advice about writing a thesis should be forewarned that the following recommendations are just that: recommendations. Every person has his or her own strategies for working and writing. The advice offered here is meant to serve as a guideline according to which you will be able to determine your own best approach to this substantial undertaking.(For a reminder of Deadlines, see the main Senior Thesis page.)Writing a senior thesis should be the culmination of a student’s undergraduate career. Work on a thesis offers an opportunity to explore an issue that engages you, to plan and direct your own work, and to draw on the knowledge of methodology and material that you have gained from course work in the concentration. Many seniors have praised the thesis project as the best learning experience of their lives. It is the intellectual adventure of shaping an idea and finding its articulate expression.The first stages of the thesis project—choosing a topic and an adviser—are perhaps the most difficult. The cardinal rule is to begin early. You should start to think seriously about a topic area and possible advisers during the spring semester of your Junior year. We expect you to contact a potential adviser in the spring and discuss your ideas then. The faculty member can give you valuable advice at that early stage and suggest reading and research for the summer. In addition, there are a number of strategies that you can employ to help you define a topic and find an adviser.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

Frere’s framing of the stories set a model for attention to individual artistry and contexts of performance not again pursued in South Asia till the mid-20th century, with the performance turn in folklore studies. In recent decades, Wadley, Gold and Raheja, Narayan, Prasad, Naithani, and Narasamamba, among others, developed text presentations and analyses linking repertoire, performance, and personal history in various ways.  As Ramanujan has pointed out, vrat katha itself is a major ritual genre in which the telling of stories shapes performatively the lives of the tellers and listeners, both in the ostensibly biographical miracle narratives framed within the ritual and the lives of the ritual participants who keep the stories alive. Blackburn’s  Another Harmony itself offered a foundational analysis of relationships of biography, narrative performance genre and ritual efficacy in South Asia.  The present paper reviews trajectories of this complex from biography to ritual studies and ends with some reflections on why the studies of performed narrative in and of lives have more usually, though not exclusively, focused on women protagonists and performers. Are we missing parallels in men’s equally situated narrative performances, or is there a systematic difference in performative focus determined by genre and/or gender?  _________________________________________________________________________SYMPOSIUM PANELSSaturday, April 9, 2016 - 9:00 am - 6:00 pm - Thompson Room, Barker CenterUNDERGRADUATE STUDENT PANEL Aniket De, Tufts University Divided Songs, Altered Gods: Partition, Nationalism, and Performance in the Bengal BorderlandThis paper studies the history of the Gambhira, a popular performance on either side of the India-Bangladesh border, mainly in Malda (West Bengal) and Rajshahi (Bangladesh). Gambhira originated from rites of the god Hindu Shiva, and later became a popular theatre form in which both Hindu and Muslim performers complained to Shiva, with ridicule, and sarcasm, about people in power. After the Partition of British India in 1947, many Muslim performers fled across the border to East Pakistan (later Bangladesh). The Muslim performers, in Bangladesh’s Islamic context, replaced the figure of Shiva with that of a Muslim farmer, and continued the performance’s older tradition of questioning authority. The paper explores the interaction between broader structural changes in state structure and the consequent impact on folk forms. I explore the realities of such performances in the borderland, as well as the competing historical metanarratives on the changes and continuities in Gambhira. Benjamin D. Grimm, Harvard University Trans-gression: Gender, Divinity, and Cross-dressing in the Krishna LīlāhavaThe līlahāva – a story in which Krishna and Rādhā exchange clothes during a night of passion – is inflected in poetry, art, and drama, and in its many loci cloaks itself in various symbolic modes: as comedic farce, as amorous play, and as a profound act of devotion. The story is imbued by tense dichotomies of male and female, divine and human, unity and disunity: is it transgressive for a cowherdess to wear Krishna’s peacock-feather crown? If so, from what does this transgression spring? The act of crossdressing exhumes basic tensions between male and female in Hindu thought. Moreover, it leads us to question the very nature of Krishna’s divinity; assuming one another’s identity reveals Rādhā as a mirror of Krishna, suggesting that she is indeed a divine consort, an endemic aspect of his own being. Declaring transgression in the līlahāva emerges from cultural – and thus human – prescriptions for a pair who is incontrovertibly transcendent.  Megan Taing, Harvard University Brotherhood and Humor: Negotiating the South Asian American College Experience  This study analyzes the interaction among members of an all-male South Asian American club at an American university, contending that humor is the principle method through which members negotiate bicultural tensions. While seemingly raucous, judgmental, or even discriminatory on the surface, their jokes reveal a deeper sentiment of tolerance and support between members of the club. This mentorship vis-à-vis comedy can be invaluable to some South Asian American males transitioning from a stricter home life to more independence in college – including newfound freedom within the academic and romantic relationship domains. By maintaining membership in a South Asian American brotherhood of sorts, these students are able to retain ties to a familiar part of their identities, the “traditional” upbringing and expectations of their parents, while simultaneously exploring and receiving peer feedback on new interests that could contradict the familiar itself.  SOUTH ASIAN FOLKLORE IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Frank J. Korom, Boston University Three Decades of Folklore Studies in South Asia: Toward a History Another Harmony marked the end of a previous era and signaled a new one in terms of studying South Asian folklore. This paper surveys the past thirty years of folkloristic scholarship on South Asia to identify significant contributions but also to point out gaps in areas of research that demand more and fuller attention. I conclude that while much has been done in the area of verbal art, very little has been done to address material culture. Moreover, the output of work on folklore in South Asia has been predominantly Indocentric, that is to say focusing almost exclusively on India at the expense of that nation’s neighbors in the region. Lastly, an overwhelming majority of the academic literature that one might call “folkloristic” focuses on Hindu traditions, while far less attention has been paid to Islam, and even less on Christianity, Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism. Adheesh Sathaye, University of British ColombiaThe Scribal Life of Folktales in Premodern India This paper will explore how and why, about a thousand years ago, it became popular in India to compile large anthologies of folktales that were told in Sanskrit and disseminated through handwritten manuscripts. Oral variants of these tales are found scattered around the world, and folklorists have long recognized that this diffusion had taken place through an intricate interplay between written and oral modes of transmission. Less understood are the historical motivations for such oral/written interplay, especially within the specific context of the medieval Sanskrit literary culture in which these anthologies were being produced. I propose to sharpen our understanding of the cultural value of folktales in the premodern past, based on the textual history of the Vetāla-pañcaviṃśati (25 Tales of the Animated Corpse) a popular medieval anthology of riddle-tales. I focus on the active role of scribes—both professional and amateur—in carving out a scribal public culture in premodern India, using a combination of folktales, proverbs, and riddles that both complemented and challenged the elite Brahminical intellectual traditions of the time.  Leela Prasad, Duke University Nameless in a Great Garden: When English Imperial Conquest Becomes a Purāṇa My paper will examine a moment on the Indian side of the colonial archive of the anthropology of India to consider an intriguing dramatic poem written by eminent folklorist and literary scholar, P. V. Ramaswami Raju (1852-1897). Sreemat Rajangala Mahodyanam, or The Great Park of The English Raj, is a long poem in Sanskrit with an English translation provided by Raju himself. I will argue that the Raju’s purāṇa-style poem, set in a wondrous garden, operates in two core registers. One register maintains a tension between superlative praise of the English empire and the other is coded criticism about empire itself. I hope to demonstrate that by skillfully incorporating the origin of the English empire (yoked to a narrative about the discovery of America) into a Hindu mythos, Ramaswami Raju is able to project the error of empire as a cosmic error. In this frame, the abrupt ending of the poem, anguished over the namelessness of its protagonist, creates a kind of a moral caesura in the narrative of glory.   SOUTH ASIAN MATERIAL CULTURE & BELIEF Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger, Emory University Standing in Cement: Ravana on the Chhattisgarhi Plains Over the last two decades, an interdisciplinary focus on the body and visual and material culture has emerged in folklore and religious studies, to counter, in part, the traditional textual/verbal focus of the respective disciplines. This paper is part of a larger study of the agency of materiality in Indian traditions, which analyzes different forms of materiality in ritual and everyday contexts. Here, I focus on the 8-10 foot tall cement images of the rakshasa antagonist Ravana of the Ramayana that are unique to the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh. They stand at village and town centers or on open fields at their outskirts.  Dramatic performances and textual readings are held in front of these images during the festival of Dashera, at the end of which firecrackers are set off around the image to indicate Ravana’s destruction. Narratively, the hero-god Ram kills him; however, materially Ravana lives, standing in cement all year. The permanence of the Ravana physical images creates an alternative theology and worldview to that of verbal epic performances. I argue that the cement Ravanas are material actors. Kirin Narayan, Australian National University Making and Narrating: Vishwakarma Family Stories among Artisans Many artisan communities across India trace descent from the Hindu god Vishwakarma, the “Universe Maker.” Identifying themselves by labels marking this family connection—including “Vishwakarmas” or “The Sons of Vishwakarma”—their traditional work was thought to continue their divine ancestor’s making and shaping of the material world. This paper examines themes of making as a form of thinking (Ingold 2013) that pervade the mythology of hereditary artisan castes associated with Vishwakarma (cf. Brouwer 1986). I focus particularly on Gujarat-based family stories and rituals of the goddess Randal Ma, honored as Vishwakarma’s daughter. How, I ask, does this unusually doubled goddess point to larger associations between Vishwakarma kinship, goddess worship, and gendered aspects of making, even as traditional caste occupations have given way to other professions, and the “Make in India” scheme has become a politicized project? Puja Sahney, SUNY- Albany Transnational Spaces of Belonging: Immigration Process, Social Ties, and Hindu Homes of Purity   This paper discusses the role trans-boundary social and symbolic ties play in shaping the way newly arrived Hindu immigrants from India manage and organize spaces in their suburban American homes around the Hindu notion of “purity.” The focus is on the Hindu domestic shrine, an important religious artifact found in Hindu houses, which influences the movement and behavior of family members and Hindus’ efforts to produce and consume religious spaces within and immediately outside the house. The paper argues that Hindu immigrant homes are transnational spaces of belonging. This transnationality of space is regulated both formally through the lengthy immigration process as well as informally through social ties maintained between people across nations. Using ethnographic data, this paper examines the space-artifact continuum around the notion of purity and how the relationships Hindus build and rebuild with domestic spaces reveal important aspects of their sense of belonging in a new country.  Ülo Valk, University of Tartu Where the Goddess Spent her Wedding Night: Place-Lore of the Kāmākhyā Temple in Silghat, Assam The paper discusses mythic histories of the temple of Kāmākhyā in Silghat on the southern bank of Brahmaputra in Nagaon district, Assam. It is based on fieldwork, conducted in the temple and the adjacent village intermittently from 2009–2015, concentrating on the stories of three Brahmin families, who have been serving the temple since its establishment in 1745. Especially important is the position of the temple in the mythic landscape of Assam and the strategies of storytelling to enhance its power of narrative gravitation to attract pilgrims. Place-lore about the temple displays some significant discrepancies and disagreements between the narrators who refer to the authority of literary sources but rely on oral traditions of the neighbourhood and on their family histories.  THE POLITICS OF FOLKLORE Leah Lowthorp, Harvard University Folklore, Politics, and the State: Kutiyattam and National/Global Heritage in India In recent decades, scholars of South Asian folklore have increasingly engaged the politics of folklore, interrogating its role in both colonialist, nationalist, and other political agendas. This paper considers the role of expressive culture in Indian postcolonial nation building through the lens of Kutiyattam Sanskrit theater of Kerala state, recognized as India’s first UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001. Through an examination of the art’s relationship with India’s national academy for dance, drama, and music, the Sangeet Natak Akademi, it traces state heritage discourse and practice over a fifty year period. It thereby explores the (re)production of the State’s role as arts patron and cultural educator, as well as a sustained state-level promotion of artistic continuity through creative adaptation and change. Shakthi Nataraj, University of California, Berkeley Critical Folkloristics and the Study of Transgender Women’s Communities in South India Scholars in the emerging field of "critical folkloristics" have criticized notions of folklore that distinguish it from "modern" institutions, emphasizing instead how notions of modernity and traditionality actively shape one another. My research examines the jamath (family) system of Tamil Nadu's thirunangai (transgender woman) communities that has lately become the object of much controversy amongst LGBT activists. Some see these precolonial kinship structures, placing gurus (mentors), above chelas (disciples), as outdated feudal relics, at odds with "modern" notions of equality. Representatives of transnational non-profits similarly argue that jamaths compromise thirunangai's abilities to effectively make "objective" decisions. Examining narratives of kinship by transgender women that manage and staff a Community Based Organization in Chennai, I argue that the logic of jamath kinship, far from being an outdated relic, both shapes and is shaped by the politics of international LGBT and HIV activism, and the functioning of Community Based Organizations.  Finnian Gerety, Brown University The Amplified Sacrifice: Sound, Technology, and Participation in Vedic Rituals in Kerala  For generations, Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala have performed sacrifices based on liturgies of the first millennium BCE. While their praxis evokes the ideal of an archaic, unchanging sacrifice, the soundscape of Nambudiri ritual culture in recent years has come to reflect technological shifts in Indian society: microphones and megawatt speakers now amplify mantras well beyond the power of the human voice. This paper examines the amplified sacrifice, arguing that local amplification of performances tracks with a regional "amplification" of the cultural prominence of Vedic ritual. This feedback loop increases the participation of non-Nambudiris in the funding, organization, and celebration of such rituals, which are now carried out as festivals with thousands of attendees and a full suite of marketing, media coverage, and VIPs.  FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactTHE INITIAL STAGESThe first stages of research should begin during the summer after your Junior year. This is a time to undertake both background and theoretical reading. Your work will lead you to take the first steps in moving from topic to argument, perhaps the most important aspect of the whole thesis project. A topic is a well-defined area of interest; an argument consists of the point you want to make about your topic and the reasons that support it.When you return in the Fall, it will be time to set about more focused research. Refining your topic and determining your argument is part persistence and part trial and error. You should expect to write a number of drafts of every part of the thesis project. Thoughts that are not written down may be lost and, furthermore, are impossible for your adviser to address in detail. Joint concentrators must follow the joint department’s tutorial guidelines and calendar. EXTENDED RESEARCH AND WRITINGOnce you have completed your prospectus, you will begin an extended period of research and writing. A project as large as a thesis should be done incrementally. Plan to work on your chapters separately—first researching, then writing. At this stage observing a strict timetable is essential. Set aside time for intense research on a given chapter. When that time is up, start writing immediately. Of course, research will not stop completely until you begin editing your thesis, but succumbing to the temptation to continue research will prevent you from pacing your writing properly. The more you work over each chapter, the better your thesis will be. And remember, as long as you start writing early, you will have time to reopen any line of research later on.A requirement of approximately 15-20 pages (the “first chapter”) to be submitted to the office of the Head Tutor by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been established by the program in order to encourage you to begin writing early.In the process of writing, you are bound to meet with a variety of difficulties. Your thesis adviser can be instrumental in working through certain problems, but do not hesitate to make use of informal advisers. Talk over your difficulties with your friends and also tutors and Teaching Fellows. Perhaps even show a draft to someone who knows nothing about your topic, as a test of how well your ideas are coming across. The Writing Center, located in the basement of Barker Center, can be a valuable source of advice on the mechanics of writing. The Center offers special help on senior theses in addition to its regular services: conferences by appointment and drop-in hours, not to mention a wide array of handouts and reference books on writing.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

	“Folklore is a body of traditional belief, custom, and expression, handed down largely by word of mouth and circulating chiefly outside of commercial and academic means of communication and instruction. Every group bound together by common interests and purposes, whether educated or uneducated, rural or urban, possesses a body of traditions which may be called its folklore. Into these traditions enter many elements, individual, popular, and even "literary," but all are absorbed and assimilated through repetition and variation into a pattern which has value and continuity for the group as a whole.”

	Introduction

	Folklore and Mythology as a discipline focuses on the study of society, past or present, through its cultural documents and artifacts—its folklore—and uses a variety of methodologies drawn from the humanities and social sciences to understand them. To concentrate on a society’s folklore and mythology (on sub-national as well as national levels) is to understand its traditional self-definition through its myths, epics, ballads, folktales, legends, beliefs, and other cultural phenomena, including music, song, and dance.  Studying a group’s folklore shows how it identifies itself in relation to other groups. 

	Inherently interdisciplinary, the study of Folklore and Mythology often draws resources from several disciplines, while maintaining its own methodological lens.  Students wishing to meet the requirements for a secondary field in Folklore and Mythology must take Culture and Belief 16. Performance, Tradition, and Cultural Studies: An Introduction to Folklore and Mythology, one of the F&M 90 topical seminars in the field, and three other courses chosen from Folklore and Mythology and/or cross-listed courses as listed in the Course Catalog and on the Folklore and Mythology website. 

	Students wishing for a particularly focused and coherent program of study should make an appointment with the Head Tutor or Chair of the program to discuss options.  Students who notify the Head Tutor early on of their intention to pursue a secondary field in Folklore and Mythology will insure that they are invited to special lectures, film showings, lunches and receptions.

	 

	FAQ

	Do all courses need to be taken for letter grade? If so, is there a grade minimum?

	Yes, courses need to be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of approved Freshman Seminars. Grades should be B- or above.

	Will relevant freshman seminars count?

	Yes, relevant Freshman Seminars will count.

	Can courses from study abroad or Harvard summer school count?

	Harvard summer school courses can count and study abroad courses taught by our faculty (i.e. in the summer) can count. Students may petition to count at most one study abroad course that is not taught by our faculty by presenting syllabi and papers from the course to the Head Tutor or Chairman.

	When do you want students to come and meet with you? Do they have to meet with you before they have finished their requirements?

	Students are encouraged to meet with the Head Tutor to discuss their plans for pursuing a Secondary Field in F&M. By doing so, they will not only receive advice on courses, they will also be invited to concentration activities and events.

	Does "signing up" give students preferential access to limited-enrollment courses?

	Preferential access to limited enrollment courses will be determined by each faculty member for his or her own course.

    ContactDuring the senior year, we expect students concentrating in Folklore & Mythology to demonstrate their command of cultural theory an analysis.  In the senior project option, Folklore and Mythology 96r, such competence may be demonstrated through, for example, a performance, exhibit, or written analysis, usually in connection with specific Folklore and Mythology courses (or related courses approved by the Head Tutor). Students who wish to be considered for high honors or highest honors write a Senior Honors Thesis, an extended research project carried out over two semesters as Folklore and Mythology 99, under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Senior Thesis DeadlinesConcentrators writing theses in the Folklore and Mythology program will be required to give their advisers the designated thesis parts by the following deadlines:1. PROSPECTUS DUE: Last Thursday in April (Junior year)2. PRESENT TO COMMITTEE: early May (Junior year), at Degree Meeting3. FIRST CHAPTER DUE: first Friday in December (Senior year)4.FINAL DEADLINE: Thursday before Spring Recess (Senior Year) N.B. Joint concentrators must follow the calendars of the other departments.

    ContactMany students in Folklore & Mythology decide to spend part of their undergraduate education studying abroad. Students should explore the possibilities at the Office of International Education (OIE; located at 77 Dunster Street) as early as possible and then see the Head Tutor to discuss possible courses and a specific plan of study. Students must file petitions for credit for study out of residence with the OIP before leaving (check with OIP, 6-2722, for deadlines).The Head Tutor must approve courses to be taken for concentration credit. Studying abroad for a full year can complicate meeting degree requirements; however, the rewards of a year abroad sometimes outweigh the difficulty of struggling to fit in all the requirements for the degree. It is important to seek advice from the Head Tutor and OIE advisers as early as possible, to plan ahead. Students are required to bring back all relevant materials (syllabi, papers written, etc.) from courses that are expected to count for concentration credit. If your instructor insists on keeping your papers, make copies. If any questions about credit should arise, it is important that you should have this information. (Grades from study-abroad programs will not be counted in students’ grade point averages, nor be taken into account when honors recommendations are made.) Students who are planning to apply for fellowships in their senior year should consult with the House tutors about the kinds of recommendations they should seek before leaving and while abroad. Please see the Head Tutor well in advance of deadlines to discuss plans.Click here for the Office of International Education website.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactOne thing few thesis writers realize is that production constitutes an entirely separate stage of the thesis project. Give yourself plenty of time to produce clean copies of your thesis.  It is NOT advised that you leave printing until the day the thesis is due, as unforeseen printing problems are not an excuse for handing in work late.  Leave yourself time for proofreading a printed copy, as well.  Readers grading the thesis may find that errors reflect poorly on the work.Refer to the section on thesis regulations below for format requirements. Again, those enrolled in Senior Tutorials outside of the Folklore & Mythology program must observe the guidelines of their department. All theses submitted to the Folklore & Mythology program must conform to the following requirements:LENGTH:The recommended length is 40-60 pages  (not including appendices, if applicable)MARGINS:Please leave a lefthand margin of 1.5"PAPER:Use archival quality, acid-free paper for all copiesCOPIES:One will remain in the F&M library; one will go to the Harvard College library archives (if magna or above); one will be returned to you, if you wish. (No copies will have comments written by readers.  Readers are asked to submit comments separately.)BINDERS:Please do not use any type of binder when turning in the thesis.  Do not staple or hole-punch any of the copies of the thesis.  We would also prefer that you not use paper-clips of any kind, including binder-clips.  Please put each copy in a folder or envelope. (For a reminder of Deadlines, see the main Senior Thesis page.)FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactBeck-Warren HouseUnited States Department of the InteriorNational Park ServiceNational Register of Historic Places Continuation SheetBeck-Warren HouseCambridge, Middlesex County, MAThe Beck-Warren House, built in 1833 for Harvard Latin professor Charles Beck and owned from 1891 to 1899 by Sanskrit scholar Henry Clarke Warren, is a two-and-a-half story Greek Revival single-family dwelling with a five-bay, center entrance plan, double end wall chimneys and flanking one-and-a-half story wings set flush with the main block walls. The walls are sheathed in narrow clapboards, the foundation is of dressed granite, and the pedimented gable roof, which contains a half-round window on the façade elevation, is slate shingled.  A three-bay wide Greek Doric porch shields the entrance.  The main house is framed with wide Doric pilasters, while the flanking wings have broad, registered quoins at the corners.  A short, one-bay wide service ell occupies the center bay of the rear wall.  A two-story, hip-roofed porch of buff brick with Grueby tile screening and capitals, added in 1897, rises at the southeast rear corner.The house presently stands within a densely developed complex of academic buildings just east of Harvard's main campus, Harvard Yard (NHL, 12/30/70; NRD, 12/14/87), in the block formed by Harvard, Quincy, Broadway and Prescott streets.  The house has been owned since 1899 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College, which has used the property as a philosophical library and, since the early 20th century, as the home of the Harvard English department.  (Since 1997, when the English department moved into the newly renovated Barker Center, the house has been occupied by the Committee on Degrees in Folklore & Mythology, Celtic Languages and Literatures, and Women's Studies; the latter of which was replaced in 2008 by offices of the Humanities Center.)  Beck-Warren House is contiguous to six academic buildings, five of which are individually listed on the National Register (Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, 3/2/90; Dana-Palmer House, 5/19/86; Fogg Art Museum, 5/19/86; Harvard Union, now the Barker Center, altered in the mid-90s, 1/26/87.)  The sixth, the Faculty Club, was constructed in 1930 and altered in the 1960s.The Beck-Warren House was moved 130' north of its original location in 1900 (but still within the boundaries of its original lot) to enable the construction of the Harvard Union (McKim, Mead & White, 1901; now the Barker Center).  Originally set on an 80,000 square foot parcel known as "Beck Park" for its extensive orchards and gardens, the house is now tightly bounded by later buildings, albeit within a well-kept setting of landscaped walkways and grounds.  A pencil-and-watercolor rendering of the house, probably executed around the mid-19th century, gives a sense of its original setting and appearance.When Henry Warren purchased the house in 1891, portions of the interior were extensively remodeled for his use; although much of the exterior remained unchanged, some elements were altered in the then-popular Colonial Revival style.  Sashes, most of which are original, are narrow-muntin, six-over-six double-hung set in casings that are topped with simple projecting cornices, but some second-story sashes may have been replaced in kind (ca. 1891) in woods to match new interior treatments.  A box bay on the second story of the east wing and an east-facing shed-roofed dormer with a series of small, round-arched awning windows were added in the remodeling and, as the rendering of the house makes clear, the original main entrance was modified.The present entrance treatment consists of a simple Greek Revival casing from which the wood-muntined transom and sidelights (shown in the rendering) and double-leaved doors were removed.  Elaborated lead fan- and sidelights were installed, along with two raised-panel doors in the Colonial Revival style.  A remarkably ornamental 19th-century exterior door survived in the basement of the house, but is no longer there; it featured paneling decorated with applied jig-sawn scrolls and anthemia.  While it appears to be too wide to have been one of the original pair of front entrance doors, the door is probably original to the house and may have been used in another location.Another likely Colonial Revival-era alteration was the substitution of wide, registered quoins on the wings for the narrow cornerboards indicated in the rendering; those quoins are disproportionate to the otherwise lightly-scaled character of the wings.Notable features of the original exterior include the plan of the house and its Doric entry, while the brick porch at the rear is the most exceptional exterior feature of the later construction phase.  The house's symmetrical rectangular plan, with a two-and-a-half story main block and subsidiary one-and-a-half story wings that occupy the full depth of the house, suggests a design usually intended for a country setting.  It is exceptional within the local context (there being no other examples of that plan in the city) and recalls the original siting of the house within park-like grounds.  Of equal note is the archaeologically-correct execution of the Doric portico, constructed at a time when vernacular interpretations of classical architecture were the norm in the quiet, semi-agrarian town that Cambridge was in the 1830s.The 1897 rear porch stands two stories tall with an enclosed ground floor surmounted by a loggia with brick piers and glazed tile balustrades.  The loggia appears to have been designed to allow for some screened or glazed enclosure: the space can be heated and the pier capitals are cut back in a way that suggests that sash could be set between them.  The tiles, in a perforated oriental pattern, and lotus-leaf capitals have a blue-green glaze.  Designed by H. Langford Warren, founder of the Harvard School of Architecture in 1893 and a charter member of Boston's Society of Arts and Crafts, the porch was published in The Brickbuilder (November, 1897 and August, 1898) as an example of the Grueby Faience Company's work.  (Langford Warren was unrelated to Henry Warren.) The interior of the Beck-Warren House is exceptionally sophisticated, both because of the highly decorative nature of original and later features and of the uniquely-adapted finishes installed ca. 1891 for Henry Warren.  In plan, the house contains a central hallway running the depth of the building.  The main stair rises three stories on the west side.  There is no back stair at present, but 20th-century alterations for the offices that now occupy the building undoubtedly account for its removal. On the ground floor of the main block on the east side are a dining room with kitchen behind and, on the west side, a double parlor running the depth of the house.  There is a small anteroom at the rear of the center hallway in the projecting ell.  The wings each contain a pair of rooms.  It is likely that the second floor plan originally mimicked the first, with a full-depth double room on the west side above the parlor and a pair of rooms on the east side.As altered by Warren, that plan was apparently extended so that the second story consisted of two large rooms running the depth of the house, with a bathroom at the rear of the center hall.  On the east side, the room was further enlarged by removing the ceiling, adding a dormer, and constructing a gallery at the third-floor level.  The half-stories above the wings contain several ancillary spaces.  The third floor consists of a series of closets (including one containing the cistern for the original plumbing) and small servants' rooms that ring the top of the stairs.  A door off the stairhall gives access to the east-side gallery.Original surviving fabric is most evident on the west side of the first floor, where the double parlor and paired chambers (probably built as an office and library for Professor Beck) survive virtually intact, the only alteration being acoustical tile that has been applied to the ceiling of the parlor (and since removed in the 1995-97 renovations).  The parlor contains a particularly elegant Corinthian-columned archway at the room's center.  All of the windows in this section, as well as those in the house's original dining room on the east side of the ground floor and one window in the small anteroom at the rear of the hall, are set in splayed reveals with interior shutters.  Window and door casings throughout the house feature cornerblocks with carved rosettes, while virtually all of the original six-panel interior doors and their hardware survive.Narrow modillion cornices crown all of the first floor walls, though in the entrance hall and dining room, additional mouldings appear to have been added ca. 1891 to make the cornices more robust.  In addition, the main stair was reworked ca. 1891 on all three floors in high-style Georgian Revival fashion with ballusters in three different spiral-turned patterns on each treat.  Narrow dadoes and original baseboards survive in several rooms, and, in the kitchen, tongue and groove panelling to the dado and an exposed brick chimney face recall that room's original function. One wall of the first-floor rear anteroom has marble wainscot, possibly indicating early use as a bathroom or pantry.  Early mantels and stove hardware include a blond European marble mantel in the northwest office, a lancet-arched gray marble mantel in the southwest office, and a pair of black marble mantels in the parlor.  The mantelpieces and chimney breasts in the dining room and southeast office are Colonial Revival replacements.The second and third floors display fully the Colonial Revival alterations of the 1890s, though remnants of original fabric remain.  To a remarkable extent, the upper floors reflect the special needs of Henry Clarke Warren, disabled in early childhood with a severe spinal injury that left him virtually immobile for the rest of his life.  The second story was remodelled as a living suite of two large rooms, enabling Warren to reside principally on that floor.  These included a bed chamber on the west side and the double-height east chamber (sometimes described as Warren's dining room but more likely a library), plus bath and, after 1897, sunporch.The west chamber is now divided into two rooms, but in Warren's remodelling was treated as a single large room.  The north and south walls are identically paneled in oak, with built-in bookcases and shallow closets.  Both chimneys have elaborate Georgian Revival mantels supported on scrolled consoles and are set within paneled overmantels and surrounds.  Warren also added a large skylight to the room that spans the partition which now divides it.An original feature of the chamber are three cased beams detailed with Greek key mouldings on the lower face.  These span the width of the west room and intersect with the paneled overmantels, suggesting that the space may have been open in Professor Beck's tenure.  What is now the southwest room contains one of the unique features of the house: a space created by closing off the façade end of the stairhall and adding to it a raised platform that Warren used for a bed.  Heated with hot air registers, wired with a call bell for assistance, and indirectly lit by glazing fitted into the hall paneling and by the window of the second-story center bay (which was shielded from drafts with an inner window of patterned glass), the platform can be completely shut off from the chamber by pulling down an overhead tambour door.On the east side, from what must have been two separate chambers, Warren created a large, oak-paneled room open to the roof and circle on the upper level by an arcaded gallery with a low balustrade of strapwork.  Lit by the east-facing dormer and, before the installation of a paneled partition at the north end (probably added when Harvard acquired the house), by pairs of windows on the north and south walls, the room also contains a large skylight, now covered over.  Also ornamenting the room are a pair of fireplaces set with glazed ceramic tile in Oriental motifs and sets of bookcases built into the endwalls.A run of wide stairs on the east side of the room, now floored over, once communicated through a double door with the sunporch to the rear and with a small room in the upper level of the east wing, which was fitted with built-in aquariums. (It is likely that wide spaces such as the double door would have accommodated Warren's need to be carried up and down stairs, just as the size of the full-depth east and west rooms would have facilitated his movement within them.)Also of note is the intact survival of Warren's ca. 1891 bath, tiled on the walls and ceiling with glazed white ceramic and on the floor with random brown tesserae.  The marble basin, overhead-tank toilet and bathtub are also original: the zinc tub fill one side of the room and contains a seat at one end and an overhead shower.  The porcelain toilet, of circular shape, is ornamented with a relief pattern depicting a basket of rushes and was originally embellished with gold leaf.  Adjacent to the toilet is a call bell, one of several extant on the second floor.The second floor stairhall is paneled to plate-rail level with raised-field paneling with chrysanthemum-pattern anaglypta above.  The stair continues to the third level, terminating in a balustrade and spindle screen that circle the opening.  The stairhall, like the east and west chambers, contains a large skylight (now closed in) that would have provided natural lighting in the hallway.Alterations to the major decorative and functional aspects of the house subsequent to Warren's ownership have been minimal.  Only the service areas of the ground floor, in the attics, and in the upper levels of the wings have been updated; those spaces have been converted to academic offices.The Beck-Warren House is significant under criterion B of the National Register for its associations with two prominent 19th-century academic figures, Charles Beck, University Professor of Latin, and Henry Clarke Warren, a pioneering Sanskrit scholar.  It is significant under criterion C as an embodiment of the distinctive characteristics of the Greek Revival style with significant alterations in the Colonial Revival style.  It is also significant for the manner in which it was adapted for the use of a disabled owner, Henry Warren.  The Beck-Warren House possesses integrity of design, materials, workmanship, feeling and association.  Despite having been moved in 1900, the house also retains integrity of location, since it remains on its original lot.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactCriterion BCharles Beck (1798-1866)Charles Beck, born in Heidelberg and holder of a doctor of philosophy degree from Tübingen, emigrated from Germany in 1824 with Charles Follen, the prominent Unitarian minister, both of whom became refugees from their native country for their liberal political beliefs.  Beck lived first in Northampton, where he taught gymnastics at the Round Hill School established by historian George Bancroft, became a U.S. citizen, and married Louisa Augusta Henshaw (1799-1830), youngest daughter of Judge Samuel and Madam Martha Hunt Henshaw, prominent landholders in Northampton.In 1831, Beck married his wife's older sister, Theresa Henshaw Phillips (1791-1863), the widow of a Boston wholesale hardware merchant, Edward Phillips (1782-1826), and in 1832 was called to be University Professor of Latin at Harvard.  In 1833, the house at 12 Quincy Street was constructed for Beck and his second wife, their daughter, Anna Louisa Beck Möring (1833-1891), and Mrs. Beck's two children, Edward Bromfield Phillips (1825-1848) and Theresa Henshaw Phillips (1827-1856; baptized Miriam Mason Phillips, Miss Phillips changed her name ca. 1847).Beck held his academic post for 19 years, resigning in 1850 to pursue private business interests.  A vice-president of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, Beck later received an honorary doctor of laws degree (1865) from Harvard.  From 1850 to his death, Beck was extremely active in local political and business life, serving as a president of the Cambridge Savings Bank and as a representative to the General Court in 1862 and 1864.  As a devoted supporter of both the abolition and Unionist causes, Beck founded and drilled with a private volunteer militia, the Twelfth Unattached Company.  An ardent horseman, Beck died March 19, 1866, following a stroke that occurred while he was riding with his daughter and the Harvard riding master.  Stores in Cambridge were closed during the time of his funeral, at which Harvard President Thomas Hill and Cambridge Mayor J. Warren Merrill were pallbearers.Beck was part of a first wave of German scholars at Harvard who helped to introduce a pedagogy that became a critical component of curriculum reforms achieved under President Charles W. Eliot (1869-1909), who instituted modern liberal arts and science educational standards unknown in early 19th-century Harvard.  Beck's entry in the Dictionary of American Biography states:"… though he lacked something of the constructive imagination which the truly great scholar must possess [, h]e was one of those who introduced into the United States the scholarship of Germany, which made the teaching of the classics more alive … and he must be included among those whose influence led the ambitious young American scholars of the two following generations to study in German universities."Beck was also memorialized in a noteworthy building constructed by his daughter, Anna Möring, in 1876.  Beck Hall (N. J. Bradlee, architect; demolished 1940), located on a triangular portion of the family's property at the intersection of Harvard and Quincy Streets and Massachusetts Avenue, was a four-story brick Victorian Gothic building constructed as Harvard Square's first luxury private dormitory.  The cynosure of elegance, Beck Hall housed the wealthiest of Harvard's students and spawned the construction of a bevy of similarly luxurious private dormitories, popular until the university's undergraduate housing policy changed to forbid off-campus living (see Harvard Square NR District, 7/27/88).A curious feature of the house frequently mentioned in accounts of its architecture is the presence of a "secret room" between the first and second floors.  The room, a few feet high, is accessed through a trapdoor in the second-story hall floor.  It appears to occupy space in the headroom above the first floor basement stairwell and communicates with the basement via an enclosed shaft with a metal spike ladder that runs alongside the basement staircase (probably removed during the renovation of the house and the installation of a kitchenette in the rear central hallway in 1995-97). Workmen uncovered the room in the 1940s. It was said to have been carpeted, hung with drapes, and contained a metal bed and small bureau.  Hardware on the trapdoor seems contemporary with the 1890s finishes of the second and third floors but the date and function of the room are unexplained.  Apocryphal accounts link Professor Beck's fervent abolitionist beliefs to the room, asserting it to be an underground railway stop.  Without further research into Beck's associations with the abolition movement or a closer examination of the materials and construction of the room, it is impossible to determine its antecedents. FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactCriterion CThe Beck-Warren House is representative of a distinctive and early local manifestation of the Greek Revival style that seems to have been developed by Harvard professors who built houses for themselves in the period between 1822 and 1836: these houses placed the five-bay-wide, center-entrance, end-wall chimney plan typical of New England Georgian and Federal architecture beneath a broad, front-facing gable roof treated as a pediment. The resulting building combined the plan and construction of the vernacular Georgian with the temple form of the incipient Greek Revival.  Approximately a half-dozen of these houses were built in the neighborhood of the Beck-Warren House with a concentration on "Professor's Row" (Kirkland Street) and adjoining Quincy Street.  In Old Cambridge, the earliest standard temple-front Greek Revival house (i.e. with a pediment projecting out over a two-story columned portico) was built in 1838.  The Beck-Warren House follows the five-bay form but is exceptional for its subsidiary wings, which give it a Palladian symmetry.There is some reason to suggest the involvement of Asher Benjamin in the design of the Beck-Warren House.  In 1832, Benjamin designed a house for Joseph T. Buckingham at 28 Quincy Street, two houses north of Beck's house at 12 Quincy Street (Quinan, 1982).  The Buckingham House, demolished in 1925 for construction of the Fogg Art Museum, had the broad-gable, five-bay, center-entrance form of Beck's house, with a Doric portico at the center bay.The Doric portico at the Beck-Warren House replicates the Greek Doric order illustrated in Plate D of The American Builder's Companion (1827), while the first-floor window treatments are as illustrated in Plate 43 of The Practice of Architecture (1833).  Window and door casing mouldings are illustrated in Plate 48, d. of The Practice of Architecture. It is clear that the builder of the Beck-Warren House was familiar with Benjamin's most recent pattern books and it seems possible that Benjamin himself may have been involved, given his design for a neighboring house of contemporary date and the close temporal relationship between the features found in the 1833 Beck-Warren House and their illustration in a pattern book of the same date.With regard to attributing the alterations made by Warren, the only direct information available is a building permit for construction of the sunporch issued in 1897 (#6737), listing H. Langford Warren as architect.  Interior alterations would not have required a building permit at that time, so it is impossible to know the architect associated with the changes undoubtedly made at the time Warren purchased the house in 1891.  Langford Warren's later involvement suggests he may have been responsible for the earlier work, but this cannot be confirmed.A curious feature of the house frequently mentioned in accounts of its architecture is the presence of a "secret room" between the first and second floors.  The room, a few feet high, is accessed through a trapdoor in the second-story hall floor.  It appears to occupy space in the headroom above the first floor basement stairwell and communicates with the basement via an enclosed shaft with a metal spike ladder that runs alongside the basement staircase (probably removed during the renovation of the house and the installation of a kitchenette in the rear central hallway in 1995-97). Workmen uncovered the room in the 1940s. It was said to have been carpeted, hung with drapes, and contained a metal bed and small bureau.  Hardware on the trapdoor seems contemporary with the 1890s finishes of the second and third floors but the date and function of the room are unexplained.  Apocryphal accounts link Professor Beck's fervent abolitionist beliefs to the room, asserting it to be an underground railway stop.  Without further research into Beck's associations with the abolition movement or a closer examination of the materials and construction of the room, it is impossible to determine its antecedents.10. Geographical DataVerbal Boundary DescriptionThe boundary of the Beck-Warren House is a rectangular 7700 square foot parcel shown as Lot 27 of Cambridge Assessor's Plat #136 and is indicated by a heavy black line on the accompanying map.Boundary JustificationThe Beck-Warren House boundary includes that portion of the property that has been associated with the house since its move in 1900.  While the historic dimensions of the Charles Beck property are still evident (the property originally consisted of Lots 26 and 27 of Plat #136), the remainder of the lot was redeveloped with the Harvard Union Building (McKim, Mead & White, 1900; now the Barker Center) after it was bequeathed to the President and Fellows of Harvard College by the terms of Henry Warren's will. FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788

    ContactHenry Clarke Warren (1854-1899)Henry Clarke Warren, second son of wealthy Boston paper manufacturer Samuel Dennis Warren, purchased the Beck house in 1891, establishing his own household there at the age of 37, presumably using funds made available to him after the 1888 death of his father.  Prior to that time, Warren, who had early on established a reclusive, scholarly lifestyle for himself, lived mostly at his family homes at 67 Mount Vernon Street, Boston and Cedar Hill, Waltham.An 1879 graduate of Harvard College and one-time resident of Beck Hall, Warren continued his studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and at Oxford University, England, furthering an early interest in classical languages and Sanskrit to embark on the study of Pali, an ancient vernacular Indic language used in Buddhist scripture.  Translator of a number of the sacred texts of southern Indian Buddhism, Warren became the "first American scholar to attain distinction" in this field, according to the Dictionary of American Biography. With his great friend, Harvard Sanskrit professor Charles R. Lanman (1850-1941), Warren founded and personally endowed the Harvard Oriental Series, a 38-volume publication of masterworks in eastern philosophy.Warren's substantial means allowed him to create a living space uniquely adapted to his needs.  Cared for for much of his life by an anonymous black manservant, and assisted in his scholarship by a staff who worked with him (presumably in the first floor room of 12 Quincy Street), Henry Warren rarely left his house, seldom received visitors, and entered into few relationships beyond those with fellow Sanskrit scholars.  It is therefore likely that his modifications to the Beck house (creating skylights, enlarging rooms, adding the heated sunporch, building in aquariums that would enliven his living quarters, and adapting spaces, such as his roomette, for maximum comfort) reflect to a marked degree the personal and private needs of this reclusive individual.The close proximity of the house to Harvard's libraries, students, and teaching staffs, and to Charles Lanman (who lived four blocks away), undoubtedly appealed to Warren.  The house's massive (and still intact) heating system may also have been attractive: Warren is said to have heated his rooms to 90˚ as a respite from his chronic pain.  On his death in 1899, Warren left the bulk of his estate, including his house, to Harvard, which had provided him a sanctuary unlike any he had been able to achieve within his family.  The benefits of this secure situation which were evident in his production of his magnum opus translations, Buddhism in Translation and the Visuddhimagga ("Way of Purity"), while resident in the house.FOLKLORE & MYTHOLOGYBarker Center, 12 Quincy StreetCambridge, MA  02138617-495-4788
