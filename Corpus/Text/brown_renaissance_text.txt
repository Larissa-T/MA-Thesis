          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Program in Renaissance and Early Modern Studies does not have its own graduate program but it supports the graduate students from other departments working in the period. Below is a list of people who form a close-knit group of REMS grad students.Amiri Ayanna's research focuses on women's agency and German vernacular authorship of the long fifteenth century. Her dissertation, “Reconsidering Gender and Genre: German Women Writers and their Readers, 1400-1550”  examines laywomen and monastic authors' writing in the vernacular. Both groups of writers used "popular" and devotional genres to give voice to personal, familial, civic, and religious concerns within the narrative framework of Christian salvation. Her work has appeared in Exemplaria, The Journal of Medieval Religious Cultures, Asymptote, and DeGruyter's Fundamentals of Medieval and Early Modern Cultures book series. She has received a PEN American Center Grant to support her translation of the Saint Katharinental Sister Book of the Nuns at Diessenhofen. Before coming to Brown, Amiri was a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellow at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich. She also earned an M.T.S. degree from Harvard Divinity School, where her work focused on late medieval women's religious history in the upper Rhineland.Charlotte Buecheler received her Licence de Lettres Modernes from Université Paris-Sorbonne Nouvelle in 2009 and M.A. in Comparative Literature from Brown University in 2015. Her research Interests include Early Modern French and English Literatures; Narrative and Reader-Response Theories; Fictionality; Disability Studies. She speaks French, English, German, Latin and Italian. Suzanne Duff is currently a Ph.D. student at Brown University in the History of Art and Architecture. Her dissertation topic concerns the role of the St. Luke’s guild in early modern Antwerp in shaping the artistic identity of artists through the guild’s material culture and social networks. She earned her Master’s degree in Art History from the University of Washington and her Bachelor of Arts in Art History from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Suzanne’s research interests include the social history of the artist in early modern Netherlands, print culture, craft guilds, markets for art, and the circulation of knowledge. Justin Gibson is a PhD student in the Department of French Studies. He  holds a BA in French from Eastern Kentucky University and an MA in French from Middlebury College. H is research interests include the guest/host relationship in Renaissance literature,  the early modern reception of classical epic hospitality, phenomenology, and ecocriticism. Christopher Gillett is a Ph.D. Candidate in the History Department at Brown University and a former NEH Research Fellow at the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies at St. Louis University. He has held a number of competitively awarded research grants and fellowships, including most recently a Fletcher Jones Foundation fellowship at the Huntington Library and a Short-Term Fellowship at the New York Public Library. His dissertation project seeks to reintegrate British and Irish Catholics into examinations of the development of revolutionary ideologies in the British Atlantic between 1630 and 1673, both by exploring the direct effects of Catholics attempts to renegotiate the Oath of Allegiance and by examining how Protestant groups hostile to such developments discovered and utilized information about these negotiations to formulate anti-popish, revolutionary rhetoric.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
