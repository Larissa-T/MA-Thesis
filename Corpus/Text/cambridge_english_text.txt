It attempts to describe in general terms what the Cambridge English Faculty expects of its graduate students and what our graduate students can reasonably expect from us. We also have specific information about our 1 year MPhil courses,    
    Please note that although prospective graduate students may   wish to look at the list of faculty members' research interests before   they decide to apply here, supervisors aren't appointed until   after the candidate has been accepted and can't appoint themselves to   supervise a project in advance.
To access the online application form please go to the  Graduate Admissions website. Information about funding and making an application are located in the navigation menu. If you have any  other queries about the admissions process please contact:          Anna  Fox
