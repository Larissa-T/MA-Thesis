          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownProfessor Ronald Martinez - Ronald_Martinez@brown.eduThe Doctoral program in Italian Studies is aimed at preparing students for academic positions in a market that is shifting its traditional focus from language and literature teaching positions toward an interdisciplinary “cultural studies” perspective. One of the fundamental assets we offer our students, in preparation for their career, is advanced training and intensive experience in teaching language and culture at various levels, along with preparation in the most current research and teaching methodologies, including special training in the digital humanities.Requirements for the Ph.D.There are three stages in the Ph.D. program: 1) Preparation for Candidacy, which includes Coursework, the First Year Review and fulfillment of the Teaching and one of the two foreign languages required in the Language Requirement; 2) Advancement to Candidacy, which includes the Preliminary Examination and the writing of an approved Dissertation Proposal; and 3) the writing of a Dissertation in completion of the degree and the completion of the final foreign language requirement.   NOTA BENE: The Graduate School requires a total of 24 credits (24 enrollment units for residency requirement) to complete the Ph.D. degree. For students entering with an M.A. or Laurea,* up to 8 credits can be transferred from the M.A. or Laurea granting institution, upon Advancement to Candidacy. Credits reflect a combination of coursework, independent study and preparation for Examinations, etc., including the completion of the Dissertation (1 credit is assigned to each course, independent study, Preliminary Examination preparation, and Dissertation work).Preparation for CandidacyCourse requirements.  At least 12 courses in Italian Studies are required of doctoral students. All courses must be taken at the 1000-, or 2000-level (Brown designates 1000-level courses as upper-level undergraduate courses and those at the 2000-level courses as graduate courses). The following are courses required of all graduate students:ITAL2100 Introduction to Italian Studies (1st year or second year, depending on when course is offered, or equivalent course, when course is not offered).  ITAL2820 Italian Studies Colloquium. In the first year, students may elect to take the Colloquium for credit, if they write short response papers on the presentations. Second-year students must take the Colloquium for credit, since they will be presenting their research in addition to participating in the colloquium. When in residency, all students are expected to attend the colloquium and all students should sign up for the course as auditors.  ITAL2900 Teaching Methodology (no later than the second year). Students are encouraged to take Teaching Methodology during the first year whenever possible. Beginning in the academic year 2009-2010, students are required to pass the course with the grade of “B” if they are to be allowed to teach during a subsequent semester. Students with less than a “B” in the course will go on automatic warning, and be required to repeat the coursework.  Graduate students are required to take three courses in Medieval/Early Modern Italian Studies (one must be on Dante), and three courses in Modern/Contemporary Italian Studies. Graduate students are also required to take at least one course in three out of four disciplinary fields (Italian literature; Italian history and anthropology; history of Italian art and architecture; Italian film and media studies). However, one course can fulfill both the chronological and the field requirement (for example: a course in Renaissance art can fulfill both the Medieval/Early Modern and the field requirement). In either area (Medieval/Early Modern or Modern/Contemporary Italian Studies) students may enroll in one independent study course (ITAL 2920: Reading and Research) in order to fulfill their requirements in that area.Students entering the program with a fellowship normally take 8 courses or independent studies in their first year. Students entering with a Teaching Assistantship are permitted to take up to 6 courses or independent studies.Transfer credits: Students transferring into the graduate program from other graduate institutions or from Italian universities are expected to complete the first year of residence at Brown before transfer credits can be recognized. It is possible to transfer a maximum of eight credits toward the Ph.D. degree. Students may get specific information about how to transfer credits from either Mona Delgado or the Director of Graduate Studies.Incompletes: The faculty views any incomplete grades that are not accounted for by circumstances over which the student has no control as danger signals. Students who take incompletes in course work find themselves in a particularly difficult situation. Not only does the incomplete suggest that they are having trouble working with graduate school conditions, but it limits the amount of evidence that would be available for evaluation. Furthermore, the work of the subsequent semester suffers badly if the student is finishing up one semester while beginning another. Accordingly, students should make every effort in order to avoid incompletes; if one proves unavoidable, the student should discuss the reasons for the incomplete with the instructor and the Graduate Advisor, so that it can be explained. Under normal circumstances, students will not be permitted to have more than one INC per semester. According to the Handbook of the Graduate School (Part VII, G) “an instructor may allow a student to complete course work after the normal deadline, but after one year, the permission of a Dean is required for a grade to be given.” Finally, graduate students in Italian Studies should be aware that outstanding grades of INC might jeopardize their TA-ships, according to the handbook regulations of the Graduate School (Part VII, G).Grades: In general, “A” or “A-“ grades should signal superior, not merely good, graduate performance in course work and on papers. “B” grades should indicate good, solid graduate-level performance. Grades in the “C” range indicate work considerably below that standard. “C” grades do afford graduate credit, but will not be counted by the Italian Studies Dept. towards the satisfaction of the departmental course requirement. Such coursework will have to be repeated again for credit. The receipt of a “C” grade in one or more of the required courses will automatically lead to a warning status. First Year ReviewAt the end of the first year, each student – whether entering with a B.A. or an M.A. – will participate in a review of his or her progress in the program. This review by the Department Graduate Committee (GC) will be based on a sample of work completed during the year (e.g. seminar papers) and on reports by the student’s instructors. The Graduate Committee will meet with the student to discuss the materials submitted and the student’s performance and to advise the student about possible fields for the Preliminary Examination.On the basis of the First Year Review, the GC will make a recommendation to the department as to whether the student may continue in the Ph.D. program. The committee can recommend that the student proceed towards advanced candidacy; or the GC may determine that the student should not continue in the Ph.D. program. In the latter case, the student may be recommended to the Graduate School for a terminal Masters degree, provided that s/he has satisfactorily completed eight (8) courses.Students who have entered the department with an M.A. and who have completed all the first year requirements may elect to receive a Brown University M.A. at their discretion. Foreign Language Requirement2 Foreign languages, other than English and Italian, are required. Examinations in other languages are administered by the relevant departments, and coursework in the FL at 1000-level or above may also fulfill the requirement. Teaching Requirement A minimum of two years of teaching experience is required for the degree.Advancement to CandidacyPreliminary ExaminationGraduate students are expected to take the Preliminary Examination (PE) by the end of the 5th-semester (Semester 1 of the third year). Successful completion of the PE authorizes the candidate to proceed with the dissertation proposal. All course requirements and the First Year Review must be successfully completed prior to the PE. At least one language requirement must be fulfilled to advance to candidacy.There are three necessary steps for the preparation and completion of the PE: 1) The student must define his or her fields of examination and form a PE committee; 2) He or she must select a list of texts and other materials for the examination in consultation with the PE committee; 3) The student must take the examination.Defining the fields and constituting a committee: By the end of the second year for students entering the program with a B.A. or the end of the third semester for those entering with an M.A., candidates must define three fields, one primary and two secondary. The candidate must also form a committee of at least two faculty members in Italian Studies and designate a chair for that committee. It is the student’s responsibility to approach a prospective chair and ask whether he or she is willing to serve on the committee. It is also the student’s responsibility to make arrangements with the committee members in order to prepare for the PE.Taken together, the three fields should delimit academic area(s) in which the student is preparing to teach, as well the scholarly context(s) for the student's projected research. The configuration of the fields for all students will be as follows:*Field 1: Medieval/Early Modern or Modern/Contemporary Italian Studies. *Field 2: A theoretical, disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspective within field 1 (or across fields): ex. microhistory, history of the book, gender studies, literary theory, political symbolism, film studies, computing for the humanities, etc.; *Field 3: An elective field such as a specific topic, theme or author within field 1: ex. Dante or Boccaccio studies, Renaissance or Baroque theatre and architecture, history of the family, fascism, (post)colonialism, migrant literature and film, etc.Reading Lists for the PEThe candidate must submit three field lists, one for each field, of at least 40-30-20 (for each list respectively) key scholarly books or the equivalent materials, such as articles and chapters, or media materials (films, etc.). All of these texts should be chosen in consultation with the student’s committee members, and the final lists must be approved by the PE committee.The Preliminary ExaminationGeneral Overview The PE consists in a written and an oral part. Part One (written examination): A take-home written exam, consisting in answers to three questions, one for each field, formulated by the PE committee and based on the lists previously submitted and approved. The candidate will have one week (Friday 9 a.m. to the following Friday 5 p.m.) to complete the assignment. Part Two (oral examination): A two-hour discussion of the written exam and field lists. This part of the exam will begin from but not be limited to the student’s written exam and the core field bibliographies. It will probe the student’s understanding of his or her field and the debates within them. The purpose of the PE is to establish both the breadth and the depth of the student’s competence and knowledge in those areas where he or she plans to teach and do research. Upon the completion of the PE, the committee will come to one of the following determinations: a) Pass; or b) directed to retake the exam. Students may retake the exam once. Specific Procedures and Guidelines for Preliminary Examinations in Italian StudiesFor the written portion of the exam:1. Students will receive via e-mail a list of questions divided according to the three bibliographies that have organized the student’s preparation for the exam.2. From these questions (two questions per bibliographic list) the student will choose one question per bibliographic list to which to respond.3. Students may respond to the questions either in Italian or in English.4. Responses should be typewritten.5. For each question, students should write approximately 2000 words, including footnotes.6. Students should include a bibliography of texts consulted. The bibliography does not count toward the word limit.7. Students are expected to work alone on their responses to the questions, but the written portion of the exam is considered a “take home” and therefore students may consult books and notes in order to write their response.8. Standards of academic citation and academic honesty apply to the exam. Students should cite texts upon which they have based their arguments or from which they have cited directly. Considering the short length allotted for the responses, lengthy direct quotes should be avoided.Time Frame and Best Procedures for Scheduling the Written and Oral Portion of the Exam:1. Whenever possible, the students’ written exam should begin on a Friday with the receipt of the questions and end on the subsequent Friday with the submission of the responses via e-mail to the chair of the committee.2. The oral portion of the preliminary exam will take place on the Tuesday following the Friday that the student has submitted her/his responses.Oral Portion of the Exam:1. The oral portion of the exam is approximately one and a half hours of discussion of the written exam and the student’s reading in the three bibliographies.2. The oral portion of the exam will be organized to examine the student’s understanding of his or her field and the debates within them.3. The exam will be structured with the following guidelines in mind: Each bibliography will receive about one-half hour of discussion.The Dissertation ProposalAfter passing the preliminary examination, and no later than September of the fourth year, the candidate must defend her or his dissertation proposal. He or she forms a dissertation committee, writes a dissertation proposal, en route to writing the dissertation and finishing the degree.It is the student's responsibility to approach a faculty member and ask if he or she is willing to serve as dissertation director. The candidate then constitutes a dissertation committee, in consultation with the dissertation director. The dissertation committee normally consists of three faculty members, at least two of whom must be in Italian Studies or affiliated with the Department. (In some cases, a candidate may request an additional faculty member – including one from another university – when it is necessary to cover unusual interests or fields pertinent to the dissertation.) The dissertation committee is often the same as the Preliminary Examination committee, but this is not required.   The candidate then writes a dissertation proposal in consultation with committee members.The dissertation proposal should furnish a clear description of the object or concern of the study, the methodological, historical or literary issues raised in the dissertation, the scholarly context and bibliography within which the work positions itself, as well as its the organization and structure.   The dissertation is generally a book-length study. It must constitute an original contribution to its fields of concern and meet the highest standards of scholarly competence. Even with a firm idea about the dissertation topic, the student should not assume that he or she can write the proposal quickly and gain fast approval by the committee. Since this is probably the first time a student will conduct research of this scale, the committee will want to ensure that the proposal demonstrates not only intellectual and scholarly depth, range, and significance; the committee will also be concerned that the project is feasible and can be completed within a reasonable amount of time.When the candidate and the dissertation director believe the proposal is ready, the committee will hold a dissertation proposal meeting with the candidate. At the thesis proposal meeting, the candidate will summarize her/his essay as if it were a scholarly paper presented in a lecture or at a conference. A discussion will follow, with the members of the Dissertation Committee first taking turns in asking questions. Questions may probe the topic of the proposal; its methodology; theoretical premises; accuracy; and thoroughness of preliminary research. Questions should lead to the clearer formulation of the dissertation project.The committee will either approve the proposal or recommend revisions. The student must submit a file copy of the final, approved proposal, along with a cover sheet signed by all members of the committee, to the Director of Graduate Studies. A file of previous dissertation proposals is kept in the Italian Studies Department office and is available for students to consult.DissertationThe dissertation is a substantial work of scholarship or criticism, generally ranging between 200 and 300 double-spaced pages. There are many considerations I choosing a topic. Given the structure of the job market, the dissertation topic plays an important role in identifying a job applicant in the minds of prospective employers. The student should seek advice on this aspect of the dissertation topic, as well as on other issues. The topic should be clearly defined and its completion feasible within a reasonable period of time. [Nota bene: Brown University regulations require that students complete their dissertation within five years of being admitted to candidacy. Exceptions to this rule are made only with the consent of the Department and the Graduate Council.]Revised June 2012* Laurea quadriennale, or “specialistica (3+2 year).Graduate School On-line Application Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownConcentration Advsior: Cristina Abbona-Sneider - Cristina_Abbona@brown.eduIt is quite possible to concentrate in Italian studies without having studied the language before coming to Brown, although doing so requires an early start. Having fulfilled the language requirement (Italian 0600), students will be able to enroll in a variety of advanced courses taught in Italian, reflecting the interdisciplinary scope of Italian studies at Brown (including literature, history, history of art, media and culture). Students are strongly encouraged to take Italian Studies courses taught in English before fulfilling the language requirement, such as the sequence ITAL 0580 and 0590.The concentration requires that students demonstrate proficiency in the Italian language by completing up to Italian 0600 (or the equivalent in Bologna). Italian 0600 is the first language course that counts toward the eight required courses for the concentration. At least four of the eight courses should be taken in Italian.More information on concentration and courses.Concentrators who enroll in the Brown in Bologna program should fulfill the requirements according to the following sequence: prior to departure, the student should complete the level of Italian language study required (Italian 0300) and enroll in one of the courses in the four distribution areas -- Italian literature; Italian History; history of Italian art and architecture; film or performance. Upon return from Bologna, the student should enroll in at least one advanced course offered by the department, preferably a course taught in Italian. Any student returning from the Bologna program must enroll in a course above the language level of Italian 0600.Credits toward the Italian Studies concentration may also be transferred from the Brown in Bologna Program. Concentrators may count three courses per semester toward the concentration (or six courses total for the year), although the course content must focus on Italy if the student wishes to count the course toward the concentration requirements. Concentrators should consult the concentration advisor to know which courses may or may not transfer as credits toward the concentration.Concentrators are encouraged to expand their understanding of Italian language, history, or culture through independent research that will result in a thesis, a translation, or a multimedia project, developed in consultation with the undergraduate concentration advisor and the individual faculty member who will advise the student’s project. The Honors thesis in Italian Studies is a two-semester thesis. Students who intend to complete an honors project should enroll for the first semester in Italian Studies 1920 (Independent Study), and have their project approved by their advisor by October 15. During the second semester, honors students enroll in Italian Studies 1990 and continue to work with their advisor to complete the project. Italian Studies 1990 does not count as one of the eight courses required for the concentration.A Capstone experiences in Italian Studies would consist of a course or project that a student, in consultation with the undergraduate advisor, feels would integrate the various intellectual engagements of this interdisciplinary concentration, and constitute a culminating experience in Italian Studies at Brown. This could include the Brown Program in Bologna, typically taken in the Junior year, and/or the honors thesis in the senior year. However, students may also apply early in the Fall or Spring semester of their senior year for permission to designate one of their courses (1000-level or above) a Capstone course. In consultation with the professor, students in Capstone courses complete an independent research, writing, or multimedia project that is well beyond the required assignment for the course. Italian Studies 1920 (Independent Study) may also be designated a Capstone course with the permission of the instructor.For additional information and to discuss concentrating in Italian Studies, please contact the concentration advisor, Cristina Abbona-SneiderProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownMEGAN DOSCH'13During her spring semester junior year, Megan studied abroad through the Brown in Bologna program. Not yet ready to return home after the semester concluded, she opted to stay in Italy for the summer helping out on a small family farm and agritourismo. After graduating in 2013 with concentrations in Religious Studies and Italian Studies, Megan spent the next two years volunteering with the Peace Corps in Senegal, West Africa. She worked as an agriculture extension agent in a small village promoting improved agricultural techniques and sustainable field management practices. Living with a host family and learning their native language of Pulaar, Megan once again recognized the value of cultural exchange that comes with living abroad. Since early 2016, Megan has been working on a diversified, organic farm on a small island twelve miles off the coast of Maine. She recently received a Fulbright to pursue the Master of Gastronomy program at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, where she will study after this growing season. The program approaches the study of food from a variety of angles  -- historical, cultural, anthropological, environmental, political -- and incorporates hands-on learning through tasting workshops and various study trips. With this Fulbright, Megan hopes to deepen her knowledge and understanding of food systems and production in order to better connect people to their environment, with food as the medium that unites them. Megan Dosch Bologna          JANET MINICHIELLO ‘07I have stayed very involved with the Italian Studies department since graduating. I spent my last semester (fall 2007) studying at the Università di Bologna through the Brown in Bologna program, and returned after Christmas to work as an assistant in the Brown in Bologna office as well as a translator for the Galleria Neon (http://www.neoncampobase.com).MICHAEL PRENTICE ‘07Since graduation, I have worked at a small management consulting firm and I have recently begun work at Verse Group, a New York-based branding company working on their strategy and research team. I am eternally grateful for the liberal arts background that I received from Brown in Italian Studies and Anthropology that has made me stand out in the business world for the ability to think critically, think outside of the box and be creative. I returned to Italy in the spring after a year's absence and found that my Italian was still as sharp as when I graduated from Brown.VALERIA KHISLAVSKY ‘07Right now I am finishing up my first (and last) year as a high school Art Teacher and Coach (Cross Country Running, Snowboarding) at Brewster Academy, a private boarding school in New Hampshire. This summer, I will be returning to a position at The Putney School Summer Programs in Vermont, and after that it's sort of a mystery. I am starting to think about traveling abroad again and have considered going back to Italy, which I can now do with confidence after having spent nine months learning the country's language and culture during my junior year at Brown.BRIAN COMMAROTO ‘05After Brown, I spent two years in Italy living in Milan and Parma for both study and work experiences. Immediately after commencement, I started a summer internship with the US State Department at the Consulate General in Milan. In Septemeber, 2005 I enrolled in the MSc program at Universita' Bocconi. My program CLEMIT (corso di laurea specialistica in economia dei mercati internazionali e delle nuove tecnologie) was taught in Italian and I studied alongside Italian students. After my first year at Bocconi, I was selected to do an internship in the Corporate Services division of Academia Barilla, a subsidiary of Barilla. During my second year of graduate school, I also had the opportunity to do some translating and editing of academic articles. Finally, I graduate from Bocconi in July, 2007 and started working in the Revenue Management department of JetBlue Airways in New York City.For me, Italian means much more than professional experiences. I met my girlfriend of 4+ years during my study abroad year in Bologna. She is now planning on coming to the United States to teach Italian. I have also become very close to her family and continue to maintain friendships from my watershed Bologna year. So even though I don't use Italian in the workplace, I do take advantage of airline industry discounts to travel back and forth and see my friends on the other side of the Atlantic.As you can see, I chose a new direction for my life after cultivating my passion for Italian at Brown.MEREDITH REICHES ‘05Italian has come in handy since graduation in funny ways! I'm in a PhD program in biological anthropology at Harvard. Biological anthropology is the study of human evolution, and my particular project concerns the evolution of puberty. I'm curious about how bodies negotiate the transition from childhood growth to adult reproductive function. For the first two and a half years, my work focused on an indigenous population in Argentina. I showed up in the semi-arid Gran Chaco of northern Argentina without speaking Spanish but, thanks to Italian Studies, I spoke Italian, and it helped me communicate while I learned Spanish.SUSAN HARRISON ‘04I graduated in 2004 with a double concentration in Classics and Italian studies. I now live in San Francisco and work at an investment management firm. Unfortunately I don't get to use my Italian very often, but I enjoyed my Italian classes in college and my year at the University of Bologna was one of the best experiences of my life.JAENNY GRACE LIN ‘03http://arthistory.uoregon.edu/jenny-linLESLIE NUNEZ ‘02I am happy to report that since graduating from Brown in Italian Studies and International Relations in 2002 I am now a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. Department of State (U.S. Diplomatic Corps). I am currently on my first tour working at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. I am also happy to announce that I am engaged to Charles Goodman, also a Foreign Service Officer working at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We will be celebrating our marriage on December 20th with friends and family in Miami, FL. After the wedding we will be heading to our next tour in Georgia at the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi. Of course, I hoping that one day I will be able to use my Italian with a tour at the U.S. Embassy in Rome or Vatican City or one of the consulates either in Florence, Milan, or Naples. The language study I received at Brown was essential preparation for the language training I have received with the Department of State. But the biggest credit goes to the Brown in Bologna Program which sparked the insatiable desire in me to experience cultures all around the world.AMBER LEVINSON ‘00After graduating from Brown in 2000, I taught foreign language in New York City for two years. My travel-lusty youth and ear for a good rhythm then led me to Rio de Janeiro, where I lived for six years. I worked with filmmaker Katia Lund (City of God, News of a Personal War) to set up a film-based educational program for underprivileged youth called Cinema Nosso, and worked on several of her film projects. I later worked as a writer and researcher in an independent documentary production company. I have just returned to the US to pursue a Ph.D. at the Stanford University School of Education, with a focus on how the filmmaking process can be used as a learning tool. My Italian Studies education prepared me with language skills to work with Italian producers as well as a broad perspective on film, literature, aesthetics and teaching. My summer work on the Decameron Web gave me a glimpse of the possibilities that technology offers in Education. I am often overwhelmed by "nostalgia" for Italy hope my work will take me back there soon.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
