						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownPlease note: the graduate program in Ethnomusicology will not be accepting any applications for the 2018-19 academic year.The Department of Music currently offers the Ph.D. in Music in two areas of study: Ethnomusicology and Computer Music (otherwise known as MEME: Multimedia and Electronic Music Experiments). The long-standing doctoral program in Ethnomusicology, established in 1968, is one of the first in the country, while the MEME doctoral program became a fully-fledged Ph.D. in 2004. The small size of both allows for significant cross talk between the students.Such dialogues tend to reach beyond the department as well. Brown graduate students regularly explore offerings in many other disciplines as part of their courses of study. Students in ethnomusicology are to be found just as often in the music building as they are in anthropology, psychology, American Studies, Africana studies and Portuguese and Brazilian studies. In the same way, students in Computer Music and Multimedia make connections with faculty in Modern Culture and Media, Visual Art, Literary Arts and Engineering. At Brown, your degree is what you make it: the more adventurous you are, the more exciting your program is likely to be.Please see the Ethnomusicology and MEME pages for detailed information on each program.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownIf music affects you deeply, and if you are curious about music as a human activity, consider graduate work in ethnomusicology, the study of people making music. At Brown, students are free to explore the meanings of music and sound through broad and deep acquaintance with musical cultures throughout the world. Ethnomusicologists document, analyze, and interpret music both as design or structure, and as performance situated in its historical, aesthetic, and social contexts.Undergraduate | Graduate | PeopleUndergraduates may pursue Ethnomusicology coursework from the moment they arrive as freshmen by enrolling in one of our first-year seminars or taking one of several introductory courses, such as Latino Diaspora Music, Popular Music and Society in Latin America, World Music Cultures or Diaspora Music in the Americas. As an Ethnomusicology concentrator, students go on to choose from a variety of upper level classes designed to explore structure and meaning in music outside the western art music tradition through area studies, performance, and courses focusing on methodology. These include Studies in Ethnomusicology, Music and Cultural Policy, Indigenous Music of the Americas, Music and Mind, Music and Modern Life, Musical Youth Cultures, American Roots Music, and Beyond Bossa Nova: Brazilian Music and Society, to name but a few. Methodology courses introduce ideas and techniques involved in documenting and understanding music throughout the world, while topics courses explore a single subject intensively. For those who wish to study ethnomusicology in conjunction with cultural studies in jazz, there is the opportunity to combine jazz with analytical and ethnographic perspectives in classes like Jazz and American Culture and Seminar in Jazz Studies.Undergraduate concentration:Degree requirementsPlease note: the graduate program in Ethnomusicology will not be accepting any applications for the 2018-19 academic year.Brown has offered the M.A. and Ph.D. in ethnomusicology since 1968.Past and current graduate students have researched such topics as flamenco guitar in Spain, folk music in the Tatra Mountains of Poland, music education in Egypt and Jordan, music and politics in a community radio station, Arab music in Indonesia, international interventions meant to reconstruct identity through music in formerly war-torn Bosnia, and the old-time string band musical culture of southwestern Virginia. A Brown doctoral degree in Music with specialization in ethnomusicology leads to a career in college and university teaching, or to a position in applied ethnomusicology outside of the academic world.C.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownCongratulations to David Fossum for being awarded the Charles Seeger Prize, an honor that recognizes the most distinguished student paper presented at the Society of Ethnomusicology Annual Meeting. At the meeting, Michael Frishkopf, Associate Professor of Music at the University of Alberta, praised Musical Canons in Ethnomusicology: The Case of Turkmen Instrumental Music, stating:Fossum's paper, building on work by Rachel Harris, Carys Wyn Jones, Katherine Bergeron, Bruno Nettl, Harry Powers, and others, extends the concept of musical canon from the paradigmatic case of the Western art music canon to Turkmen dutar music. While situating his work in larger disciplinary conversations about musical canon, he arrives at the specificity of his own project through careful ethnographic and musicological engagement with Turkmenistan performance. Fossum illustrates how a canon has coalesced around individually developed variants of traditional instrumental pieces, especially as preserved in classic recordings that are treated as models by subsequent musicians.In his nuanced analysis of the complex interplay of modernist nationalism and indigenous musical ideals, Fossum intervenes in an understanding of canon as a static collection of exemplary works, instead characterizing the Turkmen canon as reliant on local practices of memory and performance that predate the nationalist project. He explores the senses in which this effective canonization is at once a modern and traditional phenomenon, and in doing so he provides an interpretive framework that can serve as a model for further studies of other music traditions. This paper makes an important contribution to ethnomusicology by pointing to the efficacy of canon as an analytical construct across a range of modernist nationalist contexts while insisting on the specificity and musical agency of local practices of canonization. Stay Connected with MusicProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe music department is offering several new courses this semester covering a variety of topics taught by new and visiting music professors, including a course at the Cogut Center for Humanities. These classes blur the boundaries between computer music, ethnomusicology and pop culture.This course seeks to view American cultural and social history of the last century through the lens of rock music. We will investigate the history of rock and popular music from its roots in the early twentieth-century to the present. We will examine the social, cultural and political contexts that gave birth to the various genres of rock music by exploring the music through the lenses of race, class, gender, advances in technology, and developments in the music business. No musical background is required.  T/Th 1:00-2:20pm. Prof. Eric NathanThis class will explore music as a vehicle for social protest, including  historical examinations of music within the U.S. labor and civil rights  movements, music and political campaigns, contemporary activist street  bands (with a field trip to the Providence HONK! festival), and other  examples from global independence and social justice movements in  Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, Estonia, Indonesia, and others. Students  will write: two short papers on the role of music within recent protest  movements, a midterm essay, and a final research paper on a protest  topic of their choice. No previous musical background necessary; open to  all students. MWF 2:00-2:50pm Prof. Sheryl Kaskowitz This seminar-practicum explores the art, science, and politics of music  technology from a variety of theoretical and experimental perspectives.   Topics will include early mechanical instruments; World War II radio;  1960s-70s studio innovations (multitrack, analog synthesis, tape  effects); and contemporary “virtual” tech (mp3, Internet, remix apps).   We will read from ethnomusicology, music history, cultural studies, and  cognitive science.  Most class meetings will include lab where students  will create sound projects related to course topics.  We will work with  Ableton Live software, plus samplers, drum machines, and vinyl.  No  previous musical or technological training required.  Enrollment limited  to 15. F 3:00-5:20pm Prof. Sarah Hankins This course examines the music industry and highlights areas where music and business intersect. Students will work in groups to explore the role of artists as they form a band, create original music, work with producers, record music, and plan a tour to develop and maintain their fanbase. Students will learn the building blocks of a successful musical career including copyrights, fan engagement, social marketing, building and managing the artist’s team, forming business entities, budgeting, taxes, and intellectual property rights. We will examine the publishing, recording, and touring industries and explore methods and tools for developing a sustainable business strategy. W 3:00-5:20pm Prof. Valerie LovelyThis course explores how music mediates human relations to the natural world. Via case studies drawn from Western music history and from non-Western societies, we will examine how theorists use sound to think through the difference between humans and non-humans, particularly birds and whales; how composers like Grieg, Ives, and John Luther Adams seek to shape listeners’ perceptions of natural worlds and ecological systems; how people in Papua New Guinea, Mongolia, and the Peruvian Andes use sound to communicate ecological knowledge and to coordinate environmental relationships; and how instrument making forces practitioners to contend with resource extraction and climatological concerns. Some music literacy highly recommended.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe music department is offering several new courses in the Spring, spanning an exciting range of diverse topics: SuperCollider programming, the music of the Mediterranean and North Africa, the intersection of politics, art, and religion, and the life and music of Olivier Messaien. See below for descriptions, times, and instructors.MUSC 1290 Analog/Digital HybridsThis intensive studio course focuses on the creation of experimental sound works utilizing hybrid analog/digital systems developed by class members. Students will investigate synthesis techniques via the SuperCollider programming language/environment and Brown’s ARP 2500 analog modular synthesizer, and leverage these tools' unique strengths towards a personal production platform that is more than the sum of its parts. Weekly meetings include discussion of historical works, hands-on demonstrations, in-class projects, and critical engagement with new works by class members, culminating in a final project incorporating knowledge gained throughout the semester. Limited enrollment. Attendance at first class mandatory. Prerequisite: MUSC1210 or written permission. Tues. 4:00-6:20 p.m. / LAB on Mon. 3:00-5:20 p.m. Mr. CetiliaMUSC 1500B Major Masters and Repertoires of Music: Olivier MessiaenThis seminar explores Messiaen’s life, theoretical writings, and above all his music. Listening and analysis will focus on Messiaen’s idiosyncratic harmonic and rhythmic language as well as performance practice issues. We will investigate Messiaen’s use of color, plainsong, “modes of limited transposition,” “personages rhythmic,” birdsong, serialism, Greek modes, and Indian ragas via representative works. We will also examine Messiaen’s formation and his legacy as teacher/composer/performer. Final project is either student performance/analysis or a theoretical/historical paper. Prerequisite MUSC 0560. Class size limited to 20. Wed. 3:00-5:20 p.m. Prof. SteinbachMUSC1675 Music, Religion, PoliticsThis is a course about the cultural origins and the national and global legacies of central European musical traditions and their role in the building, survival, and transformations of the city of Berlin. How do we understand the cultural importance of musical works, performance, and experience at the intersection of art, politics, and religion (including the process of and debates over secularization)?  How has music served to build both inner life and community, including the “imagined community” of the nation?  How do we understand the legacy of European and national musics for the age of globalization?  Written permission required. Interested students must submit a brief essay to the instructor, indicating why they wish to be in the class and how it fits into their curriculum. Thurs. 4:00-6:20 p.m. Prof. Michael SteinbergMUSC 1905E Music in the Middle East and North AfricaThis course provides an introduction to the music of the eastern Mediterranean, north Africa, Turkey, and Iran. Throughout this tour we will view music culture through a variety of thematic lenses. We will see how music is implicated in identitarian discourses; how musical forms transcend political boundaries, ethnic lines, and religious divides; how religion constrains and stimulates musical expression; and how music intersects with gender and sexuality. We will explore elite, folk, and popular genres. Though we will also discuss musical structures and terminology, no musical training is necessary for this course.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe music department has listed new courses for the Fall 2016 semester! Find information about them here...A study of a thousand years of music of Europe and America through CDs, DVDs, and YouTube. We'll explore how individuals, institutions, and societies create music, use it, experience it, pay for it, and control it. We'll discuss music and time, music and politics, music and identity. Still, the heart of the course is listening to great music, and learning how it works.CRN 17272M/W/F 1pm in Orwig Music Hall 315-1:50pmThe Middle East, generally understood to include Iran, Turkey, the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and the Levant, is home to a diversity of musical traditions that mirrors the region’s diversity of religions, languages, and other cultural expressions. In this course, we will take an in­-depth look at several of these traditions; by listening closely to music and to the people who engage in it, students will be able to understand the always-­shifting role of music in several Middle Eastern societies. There are no prerequisites, but a background in music or a willingness to listen deeply will be very helpful. DPLL. CRN 17447T/Th 1pm-2:20pm in Orwig Music Hall 109This ensemble focuses on global percussive and song traditions, especially those of the African diaspora (based on instructor's vast musical experiences). Here western instrumentalists fuse with traditional musicians from every culture: bongo, gyil, ukulele, tabla, etc. Students will grow and develop their musical skills by learning new techniques on their own instrument, exploring a range of repertoire representing genres such as highlife, reggae, salsa, afrobeat, Afro-jazz, and global fusions. There will be unique opportunities to work on improvisation taking influence from Steve Reich, Tito Puente, Randy Weston, Hugh Masekela, Paul Simon, Miriam Makeba, Ghanaba, and Milton Nasimiento. DPLL Half credit. For more information, contact Martin_Obeng@brown.edu. Auditions will be held on Monday 9/12 from 7-9pm in Orwig 301. CRN 17448M 7pm-9pm in Orwig Music Hall 301The historic music industry provides a cautionary case study for artists and entrepreneurs. For musicians and artists of any genre, an understanding of the traditional music industry - from copyright to marketing to ethics - provides baseline “rules” that allow for optimal decision making with respect to artistic careers. For entrepreneurs, the models utilized from the music industry provide both a cautionary tale and line of sight; as goes the music industry, so goes all other industries...eventually. Students will learn the fundamental principles of the historic music industry, and will review both historic and current music industry practices in order to develop strategies and tactics applicable to other industries and entrepreneurial activities.

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe curriculum of the Department of Music offers liberal-arts students a breadth of opportunities to develop knowledge and skills as listeners, scholars, performers, and creative artists. Courses in history, theory, ethnomusicology, and technology extend critical, analytical, and scientific modes of inquiry taught elsewhere in the University.  Musicianship skills and elements of craft are honed through courses in theory and analysis, counterpoint, orchestration, score reading and conducting, technology, and applied-music instruction.  An array of performance activities together with our offerings in composition and production enable students to explore modes of creative expression.Concentrators in music elect to pursue one of three tracks: All three tracks include the foundation courses MUSC0550 and MUSC0560, that constitute a year-long intensive study of principles of voice leading and tonal harmony with a required musicianship lab.  Music Concentrators are encouraged to continue to develop musicianship skills through advanced musicianship and performance courses while taking the mastery courses and electives in their chosen track.Stay Connected with MusicProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownStudents  interested in taking MUSC0550 (or in placing out of MUSC0550) MUST take a  placement test at the first class meeting. Both sections of the class  will meet at that time in the same room. This will be your only  opportunity to take the test. Those who miss the test will be unable to  take MUSC0550 that year. MUSC0550 and  MUSC0560 are required for all three music concentration tracks. These  courses provide a thorough grounding in principles of voice leading and  harmony that are the basis of Western music from the Renaissance through  the nineteenth century, as well as training in aural and musicianship  skills including sight singing and keyboard harmony.Many  skilled musicians choose to take MUSC0550-560 regardless of whether  they plan to concentrate. These courses are a prerequisite for a number  of upper-level music courses.Students  who don't yet have the skills for MUSC0550 can register for MUSC0400  (Introduction to Music Theory), which is offered every year. Another  excellent way to prepare for MUSC0550 is to take private instrumental  lessons, preferably keyboard lessons, that include a strong component in  the rudiments of music.The  Department of Music does not award course credit for Advanced Placement  (A.P.) courses; however, students with considerable background in  theory occasionally place out of MUSC0550 and/or MUSC0560. Students  interested in placing out of MUSC0550 or MUSC0560 should take the  placement test for MUSC0550 and then consult individually with the  director of the course.The placement  test for MUSC0550 is always offered at the first class meeting.Students  taking private lessons through the Applied Music Program (AMP) are  required to take one semester of college-level theory.Students  with extensive background in music theory can place out of the AMP  theory requirement by passing the Department's AMP theory placement  exam, which is administered at the beginning of each fall semester.  Students who pass this exam may substitute any full-credit music course  (or two half-credit music courses) for the required music theory course.The  theory exam is administered on the first day of classes.You can show up to the scheduled test, which will be announced on the auditions schedule.Students who wish to take the exam but are unable to take it at the specified time should be in touch with Arlene Cole as soon as possible.Stay Connected with MusicProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
