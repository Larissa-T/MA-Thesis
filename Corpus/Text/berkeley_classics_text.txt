(For instruction in modern Greek, please visit the Department of Comparative Literature.)  This page provides a general sense our offerings; for detailed information about current course offerings, please see the Courses page on this website.  A list of all our courses we teach is available in the Academic Guide under the course designations Classics, Greek, and Latin.Many of our undergraduate courses require no knowledge of ancient Greek or of Latin. These are our “Classics” courses, numbered between 1 and 199, for example “Classics 10A: Introduction to Greek Civilization,” “Classics 17B: Introduction to the Archaeology of the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds,” and “Classics 161: Gender, Sexuality, and Culture in the Ancient World.” Generally, lower-division courses (numbered from 1-99) are introductory and broad in scope and so tend to be especially appropriate for students approaching the subject for the first time, while upper division courses (100 and above) provide a deeper look at a more closely defined topic. Typically, these upper-division courses do not have prerequisites. While some courses have fixed topics ("Introduction to Greek Civilization"), courses offered under the rubric “Classics 130: Topics in Ancient Greek and Roman Culture” change from semester to semester.  Recent examples include “The Roman Economy,” “Greek and Roman Honorific Portraits,” “Etruscan Italy,” “The Origins of Rome,” “The Literature of Everyday Life,” “Violence and the Ancient City,” and “The Trojan War: History or Myth?"In addition to our Classics courses, the Department offers a full curriculum in Latin and ancient Greek.  These courses are designated as “Greek” or “Latin”—for example, “Latin 1: Elementary Latin,” “Greek 100: Plato and Attic Prose,” and “Latin 115: Roman Drama.”  Greek 1 and 2 and Latin 1 and 2 provide a two-semester introduction to the language in question, while Greek 15 and Latin 15 cover it at a very intensive pace during the summer. Greek and Latin 1 and 15 are all open to students who have not studied the language before, and Greek and Latin 2 are open to students who have successfully completed Greek 1 or Latin 1, respectively. At the upper-division level, our courses in the languages can be separated into “intermediate” and “advanced” courses. The intermediate courses (Greek 100 and 101 and Latin 100 and 101) introduce students to Greek and Latin literary texts in prose (100) and poetry (101) while solidifying and expanding their command of the language achieved in the introductory courses; at the same time, students begin at this stage to practice developing interpretive arguments on the basis of this reading, both orally and in writing. In the advanced courses (numbered 102-199), there continues to be an emphasis on language learning, but the focus expands further to encompass significant literary, historical, or philosophical interpretation of the text or texts under examination in the course.Finally, the Department offers courses at the graduate level to students in its Classical Archaeology and Classics Ph.D. programs as well as to students in related Ph.D. programs such as the Graduate Group in Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology and the programs of the Departments of Comparative Literature, History, History of Art, and Philosophy. These courses are designated “Classics” and are numbered 200-399. They require prior subject-specific training as well as advanced knowledge of Greek and Latin. They include a proseminar in traditional practices of Classical philology including textual criticism, palaeography, and codicology (Classics 200), a proseminar in critical theory (Classics 203), a proseminar in the study of material culture (Classics 204), a proseminar in teaching methods (Classics 375), year-long surveys of the histories of Greek and Latin literature (Classics 201A-B and 202A-B, respectively), advanced courses in Greek and Latin prose composition (Classics 250 and 260, respectively), and research seminars in a wide variety of special topics.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Hearst Museum of Anthropology on Campus (three consecutive exercises per person) or a research project (either a paper or a three-dimensional model or series of architectural drawings); for the paper/model/drawings option, a variety of topics will be suggested and additional topics will possible, all of which require preliminary program statement, bibliography, discussions with the instructor, and his final approval by October 3.  Sites and monuments considered in class will be illustrated in slides and in handouts; as well as in textbooks ordered for the course.  The evidence of images is an essential part of the course; understanding schematic architectural drawings (plans and sections) and identifying representational and stylistic features are important. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The success of their creations also depended on mastery of complex procedures and techniques. The seminar will consider procedures and techniques used in working stone, metal, clay, and other materials for the creation of architecture and art, from colossal buildings to postage-stamp-size carvings and paintings.Professor Greenewalt is field director of the Sardis Expedition (jointly sponsored by Harvard and Cornell universities); has excavated in Turkey for fifty seasons; and for seven years was involved with the claim and eventual recovery by the Turkish government of gold and silver treasure looted in western Turkey between 1965 and 1968 and partly acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will be based on the rich evidence provided by both primary texts (literary and documentary), and material remains (sanctuaries, monuments, and works of art including sculpture, mosaics, painting and vase-painting), and will explore the relationship between Greek myth and religion, and the way in which Greek religion addressed contemporary notions of cosmogony, history, community, identity, science and creativity, sexuality, spirituality, and the complex roles and relationships of male and female in Greek society. No previous knowledge or experience of the ancient Greek world will be expected or required and we welcome students of all levels and from all backgrounds.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN0812210344 140518177X     7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will examine and discuss the architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics of the various periods chronologically from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period, and will examine how archaeologists and art historians interpret this evidence. One goal of the course is to understand the technical and artistic development and changes in the artifacts and their characteristic styles while gaining deeper insight into the civilization that produced them through an understanding of how the wider social and economic context conditioned and were affected by theses accomplishments.Famous monuments and sites (the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, the Panhellenic Sanctuaries of Olympia and Delphi, the Acropolis of Athens) will be examined in detail together with many new discoveries "fresh out of the ground". This material will be presented through illustrated lectures and readings. Grades will be based on three exams and a term project.

The grade will be based mainly on submission of about 9-11 compositions; the 7-9 best grades will count toward the final grade. There will also be reading assignments in Greek prose, sight reading in class, minor stylistic exercises, and some review of syntax. In addition to attendance at class, students may meet individually with the instructor for further guidance.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

A wealthy and sophisticated people living in central Italy between the 8th and 2nd centuries BC, the Etruscans leave us much of their past; by way of tombs, temples, habitation sites, and material culture. By the 7th century BC the Etruscans had created a broad network of commercial and artistic trade throughout the Mediterranean and were avid importers of Greek art. Their own artistic legacy lives on in their work in wall paintings, vase paintings, terra-cotta and bronze sculpture and gold jewelry. Since their literature has not survived, we learn about their fascinating culture by examining their art and the archaeological record. By using an *interdisciplinary*approach (archaeology, history and art history), this course will trace Etruscan civilization and art from its origins in the Villanovan Iron Age to the 2nd century BC when the Etruscans were subjugated and absorbed by the Romans. We will conclude by examining how the 18th century gave birth to ‘Etruscomania’ in Europe and led to the creation of Etruscan studies in the academic world today.

Examination requirements: a mid-term and a final consisting of an in-class exam and a take-home paper.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The principle aim is to  understand the vital interest ancient Greek societies had in general in  their myths, and especially in images of myths destined to be 'used' in  specific social situations, mainly on vases for the symposium, but also  in monumental architecture in sanctuaries and public areas. Literary  sources will be consulted with regard to analogies as well as to  specific differences, due to differences of media or of social  circumstances. The images of myth will be interpreted as significant  testimonia of social values and practice, collective mentality,  political, religious and cultural identity. Emphasis will be laid on  comparison between mythological and 'real life' imagery where similar  themes appear. Images of myth may reflect more or less directly values  and practices of 'real' life, but their specific achievement is that  they present in part ideal models or utopian imaginations, in part  counter concepts of warning or terrifying character - on principle,  however, in response to the experiences and exigencies of those  present-time societies where these images are used. This becomes  particularly evident in the continuous change of mythological themes and  their iconography from one period to the other, which makes mythological  imagery a rich and diversified expression of the historical dynamism of  early Greek societies.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

All readings will be done in English.Course requirements:  two short papers (4-6 pages); midterm exam (one hour); short on-line and in-class assignments; final exam (two hours).   7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

BCE) to Aristotle and Alexander the Great (4th C. BCE).   Weekly readings in epic, lyric and dramatic poetry, science and philosophy, and the major historians, as well as visual images and modern performances of some of the works studied, will be keyed to lectures focusing on key themes in this inventive -- but tumultuous -- period of Western civilization.  All readings will be done in English translation.   Discussion sections will explore further the ideas and themes raised in the lectures.Our goal will be two-fold:  on the one hand, to try to understand better this remote, complex culture on its own terms, and on the other, to trace the connections between such ancient Greek innovations as democracy, tragedy, philosophy, and medicine, and the modern forms that these have taken in the West.   We shall also consider some of the most prominent divisions and conflicts, both internal/social  (e. g., between male and female, rich and poor, master and slave) and external/political (especially the encounters between "West" and "East") that marked this extraordinarily eventful and culturally adventurous period.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

A wealthy and sophisticated people living in central Italy between the 8th and 2nd centuries BC, the Etruscans leave us much of their past; by way of tombs, temples, habitation sites, and more. By the 7th century BC the Etruscans had created a broad network of commercial and artistic trade throughout the Mediterranean and were avid importers of Greek art. Their own artistic legacy lives on in their wall paintings, vase paintings, terra-cotta and bronze sculpture and gold jewelry. In fact, since their literature has not survived, we learn about this fascinating civilization from the material culture that has survived. By using an interdisciplinary approach (archaeology, history and art history), this course will trace Etruscan civilization and art from its origins in the Villanovan Iron Age to the 2nd century BC when the Etruscans were subjugated and absorbed by the Romans. We will conclude by examining their rediscovery and how 18th and 19th century Europeans gave birth to what may be referred to as ?Etruscomania?. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

It considers both the literary and archaeological evidence for the earliest periods of the city's occupation, the challenges involved in using and combining these two quite different forms of evidence, and the ways in which ideology has influenced what people have believed about the early period of the city in both ancient and modern times. Particular attention will be given to recent archaeological discoveries and the ways in which these are transforming our understanding of early Rome.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The chronological sweep extends from the Iron Age to the early medieval period. While the course focuses on the Italian evidence, it also considers houses and households in a sampling of the regions that made up the Roman empire. Attention is given to recent theoretical and methodological developments in the archaeology of houses and households, with the critical reading of the relevant scholarship.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Battle paintings, for example, carried in triumphal processions, and described by Roman historians; or Greek "old master" paintings purchased for extravagant sums by art collectors like Lucullus and Hortensius, and cherished as their prize possessions-to the dismay of Roman moralists. What kinds of pictures were set up as votives in Roman temples and public spaces? What designs and subjects did ordinary Romans choose to have painted on the walls of their homes, their villas, and their tombs?This course will present the surviving evidence for a wide range of pictorial representation in the Roman world. It will include the earliest remains from the city of Rome itself; the elaborate suites of painted rooms found in the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum on the Bay of Naples; and Roman mosaics -"paintings in stone"- from Italy, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Some topics to be considered: the "four styles" of Pompeian interior decoration; the architect Vitruvius' denunciation of contemporary painting in the early Augustan period; the reproduction of Greek "old master" paintings from pattern books; the surviving paintings of the Domus Aurea, the emperor Nero\'s gigantic "Golden House" in Rome; the painting of marble statues and reliefs; and finally the brilliantly colored mummy portraits preserved by the sands of the Egyptian desert.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

By studying the surviving evidence (much of it the product of archaeological digs), students will be initiated to the architecture, sculpture, ceramics, and other material products of the ancient Greeks. We will examine closely Minoan and Mycenaean palaces and famous ancient temples like the Parthenon, bronze and marble statues of gods and prominent individuals, pots decorated with mythological and everyday-life scenes, and numerous other artifacts. The course will be primarily based on a process of familiarization with the visual evidence: understanding the material developments of Greek antiquity will help students get a firm grasp of the civilization(s) behind them, become better interpreters of the Classical world, and even informed museum visitors. No previous knowledge or experience of ancient Greece will be expected or required. Lectures will be accompanied by abundant visual material.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

My plan is to have us read several long stretches of narrative (Caesar BC, Sallust BC, Aeneid 7-12, Lucan, Tacitus? Histories) as well as a variety of shorter pieces (Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Petronius, etc.). Recurring questions and problems will include (in no particular order) genre, pollution and expiation, literary tradition and competition, language, space, identity, commemoration and forgetting, metaphor, explanation, the Principate, the empire.In order to deal with a number of texts there will be a good deal of reading in translation on a weekly basis, a somewhat smaller than usual amount of reading in the original, and a fairly standard amount of modern criticism. Participants are expected to have read and thought about the assigned texts and scholarship for each meeting of the seminar, to contribute actively and constructively to discussion, to give one oral presentation of independent, original research (c. 30-45 minutes), and to submit a final research paper. Those who wish to take the seminar for two units rather than the full four need not submit a paper but are asked to participate fully in all other aspects of the course.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Vertumnus was a god of metamorphosis ? but in which sense? Unlike his Greek counterparts, such as Proteus, Thétis or Thémis, he was not a divine force able to manifest in any possible natural form, such as fire, water, animals, trees ... The metamorphoses of Vertumnus had a specific and limited range, not only the human one, but the one of the /civitas/. He was a master of /social/ identities, able to fittingly and perfectly take each of them: as such Vertumnus is the perfect guide to introduce ourselves into the very fabric of Roman identity. What did the Romans use to determine / ascertain the identity of a person? The metamorphoses of Vertumnus can reveal that. In addition, we must take into account that Vertumnus? transformations did not take place only in some imaginary world, that of mythology and literary fiction; but in the middle of the Vicus Tuscus, because, as Propertius tells us, it was also its /statue/, cast by the legendary /artifex/ Mamurius Veturius, that had the power of turning its external semblance in an endless series of appearances. That will give us an opportunity to explore another fascinating sphere of Roman culture, i. e. the set of semiotic devices used by the Romans to identify their images.Note: the duration of this seminar will be 8 weeks only, starting October 10th and ending November 28th. The seminar can only be taken for 2 units.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Discussion will focus on differences of acting style, scenic and costume design, and performance space, as well as the use of music and dance, in comparing various approaches that modern directors have taken to adapting these plays to a contemporary context. We will also pay particular attention to the building of the Hearst Greek Theatre at UC Berkeley in 1903, and at the various classical plays that have been performed in it over the years.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Most weeks there will be a passage of English to convert into Latin, and we'll spend a good amount of time reading different kinds of prose with an eye to how they work. Please note that this is an advanced course: participants are expected already to have mastered the material covered in an intermediate textbook such as Bradley's Arnold Latin Prose Composition, either through independent work or through a course such as Latin 40. Participants who come to this course without the appropriate foundation often find the exercises difficult and frustrating and benefit less from them than would otherwise be possible. Those trying to figure out whether to take the course in this or in a later semester may want to know that it should be offered next in Spring 2014.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

A careful reading of the survey and excavation reports from the site prompts a number of questions about the origin, development, consolidation, and collapse of complex society in the Mycenaean period. We will also cast a wider net to consider Mycenae in its regional and interregional context. Specific topics of research will include themes and material from both the prehistoric and historic periods of occupation, as well as the historiography of the site and its excavations.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Perhaps no other Roman poem deals with such an extensive range of topics: the cosmos, religion, astronomy, the natural world, the rise of western civilization, the mind and sensation, even love. This course offers the opportunity to explore Lucretius' universal narrative, as well as the various ways in which the poet attempts to represent his text as 'the universe itself'. We will also enhance our understanding of 'the poem about the universe' from the perspective of its reception in fictional and scientific literature, including its most recent treatment by Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve: How the World became Modern.Course may be used to satisfy the Arts and Literature breadth requirement in Letters and Science. TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

It provides an introduction to Greek drama through Euripidean tragedy. We will read Euripides? Medea, with close attention paid to translation of the Greek text and to the literary issues raised by this play. We will in addition attempt to locate Euripides? play within broader Greek cultural discourses on (e.g.) the problematic nature of women, and Greeks and the East/the barbarian (as time permits).TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We shall also study Tacitus's treatment of Seneca's life. Class work will be a combination of translation and close analysis of Seneca's principal themes and Stoic ideas. For the mid-term, students will take an in-class test that includes passages for translation and for comment. The final examination will be similar, with the addition of a take-home essay paper on a topic of your choosing in consultation with myself.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will first read extracts from Petrarchs Latin works, then focus for about a month on literary works produced in (basically) 15th-century Florence (Salutati, Bruni, Pico, Poliziano). In the last third of the course we will explore some - mainly poetic - genres (e.g. love poetry by Johannes Secundus; Milton's Latin poems; neo-Latin epics; and some early-modern philology).    Emphasis is on translation and interpretation, but there will be a number of introductory or summarizing mini-lectures on single authors, contexts, or more general problems (as e.g. imitation and intertextuality; humanist style(s); humanist philology; modern interpretations of humanism etc.) We will also visit the Bancroft library and look at humanist manuscripts (including the single witness of an early work by Petrarch!) and early-printed books (mostly first editions of Classical authors). Altogether, the course will attempt to be an intellectual history of Renaissance culture via the reading of key literary works.   The course is aimed at diverse audiences. Classicists will be able to study the reception of classical literature in the early-modern period, a period crucial for the emergence of a "modern" conception of "the Classics"; students of vernacular literatures will be able to study the Latin counterparts (and often foundations) of vernacular humanist culture; and early modernists from disciplines as History or Art History will have the opportunity to explore the intellectual undercurrents of early-modern institutions and/or artistic creation.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will be based on the rich evidence provided by both primary texts (literary and documentary), and material remains (sanctuaries, monuments, and works of art including sculpture, mosaics, painting and vase-painting), and will explore the relationship between Greek myth and religion, and the way in which Greek religion addressed contemporary notions of cosmogony, history, community, identity, science and creativity, sexuality, spirituality, and the complex roles and relationships of male and female in Greek society.No previous knowledge or experience of the ancient Greek world will be expected or required and we welcome students of all levels and from all backgrounds.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBNWiley-Blackwell 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences that this has for the way we, as historians, must approach them. Ancient authors to be sampled in this course: Plutarch, Xenophon, Plato, Diogenes Laertius, Augustus, Suetonius, the Scriptores Historiae Augustae, the Panegyrici Latini.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Sexuality will be defined as including sexual acts (e.g. sodomy, pederasty, masturbation); sexual identities (e.g. erastes anderomenos); and sexual systems (e.g. kinship structures, subcultures, political hierarchies). Readings and lectures will focus on situating queer sexualities relative to dominant organizations of sex and gender. Topics will include Greek democracy and male homosexuality; the biology of sexual difference; the politics of sodomy; "romantic" friendship between women and men; and the emergence of strictly defined homosexual and heterosexual identities. We will read literary texts along with historical documents and critical essays to constitute a comparative analysis of ancient Greek and 19th-century European systems of gender and sexuality.Authors to be read include Hesiod, Sappho, Aeschylus, Plato, Wilde, Freud, and Foucault.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBNRecommended:TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will examine and discuss the architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics of the various periods chronologically from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period, and will examine how archaeologists and art historians interpret this evidence. One goal of the course is to understand the technical and artistic development and changes in the artifacts and their characteristic styles while gaining deeper insight into the civilization that produced them through an understanding of how the wider social and economic context conditioned and were affected by these accomplishmentsFamous monuments and sites (the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, the Panhellenic Sanctuaries of Olympia and Delphi, the Acropolis of Athens) will be examined in detail together with many new discoveries "fresh out of the ground". This material will be presented through illustrated lectures and readings. Grades will be based on three exams and a term project.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

	October 2, 9, 16, 23, 30Surveying the most ancient Roman sources - or at any rate the texts describing the most ancient period of Rome - scarcely any reference at all can be found to cosmogonies, theogonies, or anthropogonies. The Etruscans, by contrast, have left at least one trace of a cosmogony, not to speak of the well known Mesopotamic and Hebrew narratives, of the Hesiodic Theogony or of the other 'indo-european' cosmological traditions. It does not mean that the Romans, in the course of their history, did not at some time compose works dealing with the origin of the cosmos and of man: they did, of course - but only after their city had already been in existence for centuries and its citizens had acquired a great empire. Only at this point did Lucretius write the fifth book of De rerum natura, Vergil the sixth Eclogue, and Ovid the first book of his Metamorphoses. Why the Romans waited so long to compose works of this kind? Why did they not do so earlier? This is the question we will try to answer - in the conviction that in order to understand a culture, sometimes it is as useful to reflect on what is absent from that culture as to study what is actually present in it.By exploring the specific cultural frames according to which the Romans thought their relations with the world and the gods, we will have the opportunity of better understanding some very specific features of their religious system: such as the possibility of translating, borrowing and 'creolizing' the gods of other cultures.A handout of texts and a bibliography will be distributed in class.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

	-the management of symbolic space (the City; provinces; the edges of the world).
	-the relationship of geographic texts to the Roman triumph; and the role of geographic excurses in poetry and historiography.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The grade will be based mainly on submission of about 9-11 compositions; the 7-9 best grades will count toward the final grade. There will also be reading assignments in Greek prose, sight reading in class, minor stylistic exercises, and some review of syntax. In addition to attendance at class, students may meet individually with the instructor for further guidance.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

These centers, which played a determining role in the emergence of social, political, and economic complexity in the Italian peninsula, have been the focus of a very substantial amount of field research over the past 15-20 years, and particular attention will be accorded to the results of this more recent work. Each of the seminar participants will assume responsibility for one of the major Etruscan cities, presenting the evidence pertaining to this center to the seminar in a series of four 30-minute reports (background, formative period, Classical/Hellenistic period, city and territory). Each participant enrolled for the full four units will also produce a seminar paper that is based on material from or relating to his/her center, presenting a 30-minute report on this work. Since the bulk of the relevant literature is in Italian, a reading ability in Italian is essential to participation in the seminar.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius and Lucian) as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri.Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between magic, religion, and philosophy.Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.CURRENTLY FULLTitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

At the same time, we will be using this rich and interesting group of works as material on which to develop and practice higher-level reading and writing skills. Lectures will offer historical context, identify significant recurring themes, and provide examples of ways of making arguments about literature. Sections will provide a forum both for discussion of the readings and for the development of practical strategies for effective and interesting writing. Although there will be a final exam and various in-section written exercises, the heart of your graded written work will be a series of drafts and revisions of short, sharp essays.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBNThe Oresteia 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Already in antiquity Demosthenes was considered the greatest of the 10 canonical Attic orators, and On the Crown his greatest achievement. The speech was delivered in the context of a fierce political battle between Demosthenes and his arch-rival Aeschines, and gave Demosthenes the opportunity to present a detailed account of his political career, which was characterized by a stubborn, albeit unsuccessful, anti-Macedonian policy. Close reading of the speech in the original along with a reading of Aeschines' companion-piece Against Ctesiphon (in translation) will allow students to delve into the intricacies of a most exciting historical period that saw the rise of Macedon under Philip II, the epoch-making battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), the destruction of Thebes, and, eventually, the decline of Athens itself. The course will also allow students to improve their Greek while learning to appreciate the widely celebrated rhetorical virtues of On the Crown.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will focus on what made Greek culture distinctive and different from our own, including such topics as the cultural and political contexts of artistic performance; the rise of democracy and its co-implication with slavery and imperialism; the relation of individual to community; and the sex-gender system. This will entail substantial reading in translation of primary texts, including Homer, Hesiod, Attic tragedy and comedy, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plato. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

A sophisticated and wealthy people living in central Italy between the 9th and 1st centuries BCE, the Etruscans leave us much of their past through their material, namely, tombs, temples, habitation sites, and more. By the 7th century BCE the Etruscans had created a broad network of commercial and artistic trade throughout the Mediterranean and were avid importers of Greek and Near Eastern art. Their own artistic legacy lives on in their wall paintings, bronze and clay sculpture, vase paintings and gold jewelry. In fact, since their literature has not survived, it is from their material history that we learn about their fascinating culture. By using an interdisciplinary approach to examining the Etruscans (archaeology, history and art history), this course will trace Etruscan civilization from its origins in the Villanovan Iron Age to the 1st century BCE when they were subjugated and absorbed by the Romans. We will conclude by looking at how the 18th century gave birth to ‘Etruscomania’ in Europe and led to the creation of Etruscan studies in the academic world today. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The ancient Greeks and Romans had their own take on love, but they – like ourselves -- saw a wide spectrum of ways in which humans deal with this most fundamental of the passions. Are we helpless victims of Eros and Aphrodite, Cupid and Venus? How do we get our needs met? What does love feel like? Lastly, can we control love? Can we be in charge, masters in the art of love? In this course we will trace the history of literary depictions of love and desire from the Homeric poems, through Sappho, Greek tragedy and Plato to Catullus, Roman elegy and the writings of Ovid, that most brilliant of love poets from Classical Antiquity, whose outrageous and hilarious Art of Love, the only love manual from this cultural context, cost its author his freedom and banished him to the outer margins of the known world until his death. Grades will be based on quizzes, one midterm, one term paper and the final exam. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will examine and discuss the architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics of the various periods chronologically from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period, and will examine how archaeologists and art historians interpret this evidence. One goal of the course is to understand the technical and artistic development and changes in the artifacts and their characteristic styles while gaining deeper insight into the civilization that produced them through an understanding of how the wider social and economic context conditioned and were affected by these accomplishments.Famous monuments and sites (the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, the Panhellenic Sanctuaries of Olympia and Delphi, the Acropolis of Athens) will be examined in detail together with many new discoveries “fresh out of the ground”.

Our main work outside of class will be reading in Latin, and we will aim to read well every week a modest but useful amount of Latin—on average, thirty Oxford Classical Text pages of prose or 1000 lines of verse. We’ll spend our time in class giving careful attention to the Latin of our texts, exploring literary-historical and stylistic questions, and interpreting critically the works we read. Short written exercises may also be useful from time to time. The grade will be based on a series of weekly quizzes meant to test our understanding of the Latin assigned and on work in class.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Yet the archaeology of cult, the evidence of Mycenaean texts, and a host of other materials seem to contradict the ancient historian. This seminar will focus on Homeric gods and related phenomena in order to articulate the ways in which epic poetry defined and presented religious concepts within (sometimes in contradistinction to) archaic Greek culture. Readings include the Iliad and Odyssey (about 5000 lines in Greek, the rest in English), site reports, and secondary literature on cult, comparative religion, and the history of Homeric interpretation.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

In other words, why what we call ‘authority’ was conceived by the Romans in terms of “growth” (augere) and connected with notions such as “author” (auctor), “augury” (augur, augurium), sacrifice (augmentum), “solemnity” “majesty” (augustus, Augustus) and so on? Why the Roman aristocratic funeral was populated by images and living doubles of the deceased - and why some of these mirroring presences did exhibit a comic / mocking inflection? Finally, why and how Roman religion could ‘translate’ in indigenous terms the gods of other populations and even import some of them? Aim of the seminar will be to provide a set of possible answers to those and other questions, in order to detect the cultural frames according to which similar processes took place in Roman civilization.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will spend some time resolving immediate practical issues, some time practicing teaching skills in demonstrations and other hands-on activities, and some time on readings and discussions intended to be both informative and thought-provoking. This class will prepare you to teach both ancient languages and discussion/writing courses where the texts are taught in translation. I am also happy to consult with you one-on-one during the semester about any issues that arise in your teaching.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will read in their entirety Lysias I, On the Murder of Eratosthenes, and a short Platonic dialogue, the Crito. If time permits, we will also translate some texts at sight. Although our main focus will be on grammar review, we will always approach the texts we read as intrinsically valuable and interesting works. We will examine how Lysias uses argument and style to produce persuasion, and we will think about the relation between persuasion and philosophical argument in Plato. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

So we'll take a look at some short excerpts (in Greek) from Aristophanes’ The Frogs, bits of Orphic initiation poetry, and parts of the Homeric Hymn to Dionysos, as well as some visual representations of Dionysos and 5th C. theater in Athens. We will also read (in English) a number of scholarly articles that discuss the Bacchae and Dionysian religion, and we will attend to the reception of the play by NIetzsche and others in the modern era. REQUIREMENTS: 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Most of our reading will come from Julius Caesar's Commentarii. As part of this transition, we will engage in a thorough review of Latin syntax and morphology, and we will seek to improve our grasp of both of these aspects of Latin grammar through short English-to-Latin exercises keyed to the reading. The prerequisite for the course is successful completion of Latin 1 and 2, Latin 10, Latin 15, or the equivalent (experience in high school Latin is often sufficient). The grade will be based on in-class work, homework, quizzes, and examinations.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will examine and discuss the architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics of the various periods chronologically from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period, and will examine how archaeologists and art historians interpret this evidence. One goal of the course is to understand the technical and artistic development and changes in the artifacts and their characteristic styles while gaining deeper insight into the civilization that produced them through an understanding of how the wider social and economic context conditioned and were affected by these accomplishments.Famous monuments and sites (the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, the Panhellenic Sanctuaries of Olympia and Delphi, the Acropolis of Athens) will be examined in detail together with many new discoveries “fresh out of the ground”. This material will be presented through illustrated lectures and readings. Grades will be based on three exams and a term project.CURRENTLY FULL  7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The recent affective turn in the humanities has reclaimed an emphasis on sensation, the aesthetic, and the textural, previously subordinated to meaning, the semiotic, and the textual. In this course, we will examine two Sophoclean plays that thematize affective relations between human, as well as non-human, bodies. These two late plays also look back at the experience of theater-making and tragedy, overlaying their plots with self-reflexive overtones. We will recover the sensory and affective intensities that bind or separate characters—human and non-human—on stage, asking ourselves how they may shed light on the trajectories of the plots and, ultimately, on interactions between play and audience. We will try to understand how bringing the notion of “feeling” back to the center of the interpretive enterprise changes our perception of tragedy. In each meeting we will discuss both theoretical readings and specific articles on the two plays. Students will be asked to give two short presentations and a longer one to preview their final papers. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

For students new to Aristotle, this text provides an excellent conspectus of his views on such central concepts as form and matter, potentiality, and causality.  The weekly agenda of the class, after my orientations, will consist of reading and discussion of the text in Greek, section by section.  Those taking the class for two units will present a section (with translation and discussion). Those taking it for four units will, in addition, write a commentary on one section or topic. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Mycenae was the home or haunt for many of the greatest heroes of mythology: Perseus, Herakles, and Agamemnon, not to mention some of the most illustrious characters: murderous and incestuous Atreus, husband-slaying Clytemnestra, and matricidal Orestes. It is the setting for tragedy, epic, and intrigue.Despite the fantastic tales associated with it, Mycenae is a real place with a real history. The archaeological excavation of the site has spanned more than a century and produced amazing treasures and unbelievable modern legends, including characters, like Heinrich Schliemann, almost as mythical as the ancient heroes he investigated. Mycenae was indeed ‘Rich in Gold’ as it was also rich in mythology, history, and modern adventure.Mycenae will be the setting for our seminar, with the mythological heroes and villains as its main characters, and the excavated artifacts as its props. The course will be primarily class discussion based on readings. Requirements: Regular attendance and participation in class once a week; several short written assignments on questions and/or topics of discussion. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

On the one side: Peter Abelard (1079-1142), illustrious intellectual, implausible monk, and condemned heretic; on the other: Heloise, his learned pupil, forbidden mistress, then wife and later abbess of his monastery. Reflecting on their shared life, the infamous couple writes a set of intriguing letters to each other, with topics topics including Abelard's long autobiographical letter on his misfortunes, Heloise’s confession of her sexual desire, and a number of more didactic and instructional treatises on the dignity of nuns.In this course we will study this famous correspondence by reading significant portions from this rich corpus. Although our emphasis will be on reading and translating, we will always analyze and explore literary and stylistic aspects, intellectual and institutional contexts, and the dense web of political intrigue woven around Abelard. In addition to our main corpus, we will read extracts from related texts as the purported early letters between Abelard and Heloise, letters by Bernhard of Clairvaux, and some of the hymns and laments composed by Abelard for Heloise.The course is open to students from all disciplinary backgrounds. Classicists will be given the opportunity to study some important (and relatively accessible) postclassical texts from one of the most vibrant periods, the so called “Renaissance of the 12th century”. Medievalists may use the opportunity to hone their Latin skills and/or study a much written-about text in the Latin original (the course can also be taken as fulfillment of the Latin requirement of our Medieval Studies program). All texts will be made available via bcourses. For introduction and our background readings, students are encouraged to purchase Michael Clanchy, Peter Abelard. A Medieval Life, 1999 (and reprints).7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

But what do students of Roman culture gain by focusing on the multiplicity of the Roman gods? Our investigation will have two strands: we will take a critical look at the literature on “polytheism” as a concept in the study of religion and we will look at (some of the) literary and material evidence for Roman engagement with multiple deities. For the latter strand, we will spend several meetings reading significant selections from Cicero’s De Natura Deorum, a particularly valuable witness to the Roman (and Greek) intellectual reckoning with divine plurality, and the fragments of the later books of Varro’s Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Written in Latin more than two thousand years ago, within the context of the late Republic of ancient Rome, the poem seeks to remove your fear of the gods and of death so that you can live a happy life. For Lucretius, the key to losing your fear is to understand the physical laws of the universe. In this philosopical treatise, written in beautiful poetry, Lucretius describes a theory of the universe according to which nothing exists but atoms and void, argues that the soul is made of these and dissolves upon the death of the body, explains the operation of the senses, considers the origin of the world and the beginning of civilization, and surveys a wide range of natural phenomena (especially weather, seismic events, bodies of water, magnetism, disease). This is a poem likely to be interesting to people interested in poetry and literature, in science, in philosophy, or in ancient Rome.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course begins with some grammar review and practice with composing sentence before moving on to paragraph-length compositions. The grade will be based mainly on submission of about 10 compositions (with the two lowest grades on compositions before the final being dropped from the calculation). There will also be reading assignments in Greek prose, sight reading in class, minor stylistic exercises. In addition to attendance at class, students may meet individually with the instructor to go over a draft before submitting the composition to be graded. Books have not been ordered, since most readings are xeroxed or PDF, but usually we read more extensively form Plato’s Symposium and Demosthenes, On the Crown, for which the Cambridge green-and-yellow editions of K. J. Dover and Harvey Yunis, respectively, are recommended.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

BCE) to Plato and Aristotle (4th C. BCE).   Weekly readings in epic, lyric poetry, drama, science and philosophy, and the major historians, as well as visual images and modern performances of some of the works studied, will be keyed to lectures focusing on major themes in this inventive -- and tumultuous -- period of Western civilization.  All readings will be done in English translation.   Discussion sections will explore further the ideas and themes raised in the lectures.Our goal will be two-fold:  on the one hand, to try to understand better this remote, complex culture on its own terms, and on the other, to trace the connections between such ancient Greek innovations as democracy, tragedy, philosophy, and medicine, and the modern forms that these have taken in the West.   We shall also consider some of the most prominent divisions and conflicts, both internal/social  (e. g., between male and female, rich and poor, master and slave) and external/political (especially the encounters between "West" and "East") that marked this extraordinarily eventful and culturally adventurous period.Requirements:  two short papers; final exam; weekly assignments in section.Jocelyn SaidenbergMark McClayMark McClayRyan ReynoldsJocelyn SaidenbergRyan Reynolds 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Prima facie emotions seem to be feelings, but they are not simply ways in which our mind is moved as a consequence of some bodily change. Unlike feelings depending solely on bodily changes, such as, e.g., bodily pain, emotions seem to be about something or other, and to have some kind of connection with our beliefs. It is, however, equally difficult to conclude that emotions just are beliefs, for sometimes they seem impervious to reason, as is often the case with fear, for instance. In this course we will examine ancient theories of the emotions from Plato to Galen. By looking at the ancient Greek philosophical tradition (Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics) we will explore different views about the role of representations (phantasiai) and/or beliefs in the constitution of our emotions, and we will analyze different accounts of the relation between emotions and desires. By looking at the medical and medico-philosophical tradition (excerpts from the Corpus Hippocraticum, the Ps.-Aristotle’s Problemata, and Galen) we will consider the connection between bodily changes and emotional dispositions.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will examine and discuss the architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics of the various periods chronologically from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic period, and will examine how archaeologists and art historians interpret this evidence. One goal of the course is to understand the technical and artistic development and changes in the artifacts and their characteristic styles while gaining deeper insight into the civilization that produced them through an understanding of how the wider social and economic context conditioned and were affected by these accomplishments.
	Famous monuments and sites (the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, the Panhellenic Sanctuaries of Olympia and Delphi, the Acropolis of Athens) will be examined in detail together with many new discoveries “fresh out of the ground”. This material will be presented through illustrated lectures and readings. Grades will be based on three exams and a term project. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

	What does someone need to be an archaeologist? A pith helmet? A leather jacket? A whip? Hollywood would like us to believe that treasure-hunting heroes are searching for treasure and saving the world in one of the most adventurous and romantic careers possible – archaeology.
	The reality is something quite different but even more interesting. Archaeology is the study of the human past, a window into the cultures and times from which the world of today developed. With insight into the lives of the ancients, we learn a tremendous amount about ourselves and our future potential. Today, archaeology is about history, art, science, cultural heritage, and international law. To be an archaeologist you need to be inquisitive, imaginative and incredibly enthusiastic – especially about holding a simple object that someone dropped hundreds or thousands of years ago and using your mind like a time-machine to meet that individual in the context of his life. This seminar will be an opportunity to analyze the romantic legends, figures, and stereotypes of archaeology and to discover the exciting real elements and adventures of today’s archaeologist. 
	The course will be class discussion primarily based on readings. Requirements: Regular attendance and participation in class once a week; several short written assignments on questions and/or topics of discussion.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will start by examining the kind of questions in which the first Greek philosophers, the so-called Presocratics, are interested. As we will see, these concern natural philosophy, and, more precisely, the causes of the universe and of all natural things. Then we will look at Socrates and at the different type of questions he is interested in. These may be called “ethical questions”, as they aim to deepen our understanding of what a good life is and of what we need to do to achieve it. What should we care for in order to live well, Socrates wonders, money, political power, or something else? His answer is that, to live well, we need to care for our soul. But, one might ask, what is a soul, and what does it mean to care for it? To see how one can approach these questions, and go about answering them, we will examine Plato’s psychology and metaphysics and Aristotle’s criticism of them. Despite their differences, both Plato and Aristotle think that, to live a good life, a human being needs to be virtuous, but does this mean that virtue is all one needs to lead a happy and flourishing life? We will end the course by considering two different answers to this question: that of the Epicureans, who think that a flourishing life is a life of pleasure and that virtue can only be a means to achieve pleasure, and that of the Stoics, who think that virtue is in itself entirely sufficient for happiness. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Our translation of this novel, which has fascinated  modern writers and artists (including Shakespeare, Rousseau, Mishima, Chagall, and Picasso), will offer an entry point into some of the central issues of the Greek romance and their interconnections, including the relations between desire and sexuality, human and non-human (landscapes and non-human animals), genre and narrative form, and vision and textuality. In addition to translating the text with close attention to its linguistic features, we will read extracts from other Greek novels and a selection of scholarly articles.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will read together texts by helpful, central prose authors, including Caesar and Cicero. We will strengthen our grasp on Latin with a thorough review of Latin morphology (word forms) and syntax (how words fit together grammatically) and will regularly do short English to Latin exercises to improve our understanding of Latin and our confidence and comfort in thinking about and interpreting the language. The course will leave us much better prepared to deal with all sorts of Latin, prose and poetry, in later courses.

The Georgics is a poem about farming. This may not sound promising, but just you wait. Fortunately for us, the Georgics is also, in Vergil’s hands, one of the most beautiful and provocative things you will ever read. It is a poem about what the world is that we human beings find ourselves in, and how we make lives in that world, and how our efforts in life matter. It is about hope and despair, about success and failure, about joy and grief, about understanding and ignorance. We will supplement our reading in Latin with reading in translation of other ancient works with which the Georgics interact—primarily Lucretius’ On the Nature of Things and Hesiod’s Works and Days—and with modern critical discussions of the Georgics.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will focus on what made Greek culture distinctive and different from our own, including such topics as the cultural and political contexts of artistic performance; the rise of democracy and its co-implication with slavery and imperialism; the relation of individual to community; and the sex-gender system. This will entail substantial reading in translation of primary texts, including Homer, Hesiod, Attic tragedy and comedy, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plato. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

A sophisticated and prosperous people living in central Italy between the 8th and 2nd centuries BCE, the Etruscans leave us much of their past through their material culture, namely, tombs, temples, habitation sites, and more. By the 7th century BCE the Etruscans had created a broad network of commercial and artistic trade routes throughout the Mediterranean and were avid importers of Greek and Near Eastern art. Their own artistic legacy lives on in their wall paintings, bronze and clay sculpture, vase paintings and gold jewelry. In fact, since their literature has not survived, it is from their material history that we learn about their fascinating culture. By using an interdisciplinary approach to examining the Etruscans (archaeology, history and art history), this course will trace Etruscan civilization from its origins in the Villanovan Iron Age to the 2nd century BCE when they were taken over and absorbed by the Romans. We will conclude by looking at how the 18th century gave birth to ‘Etruscomania’ in Europe and how that ed to the creation of Etruscan studies in the academic world today.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Students will be encouraged to bring into the discussion their own musical interests and tastes, for comparison with the wide range of “differences” that we encounter in the ancient Greek context. We will consider too comparative material drawn from other societies (both ancient and modern), in which music has been variously defined and in which musical practices, institutions, and attitudes have differed considerably.  Some modern scholarly analyses (aesthetic, cognitive, biological, ethnomusicological) will be assigned as well, to help us formulate our own approach and methods of investigation.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

By studying the surviving evidence (much of it the product of archaeological digs), students will be initiated to the architecture, sculpture, ceramics, and other material products of the ancient Greeks. We will examine closely Minoan and Mycenaean palaces and famous ancient temples like the Parthenon, bronze and marble statues of gods and prominent individuals, pots decorated with mythological and everyday-life scenes, and numerous other artifacts. The course will be primarily based on a process of familiarization with the visual evidence: understanding the material developments of Greek antiquity will help students get a firm grasp of the civilization(s) behind them, become better interpreters of the Classical world, and even informed museum visitors. No previous knowledge or experience of ancient Greece will be expected or required.Lectures will be accompanied by abundant visual material. Grading will be based on attendance, participation in class discussion/s and quizzes (30%), two midterms (20+20=40%), and one final exam paper (30%). * Richard T.

(We'll discuss that definition.)  On the Greek side, we will read Hesiod's three main poems (Theogony, Works and days, Catalogue of Women), parts of Empedokles's poem(s) On Nature and Purification, one or two other preSocratics (e.g. Seven Sages, Anaximandros, Herakleitos); and on the Near Eastern side, we'll read <in English translation> some classic Babylonian (Akkadian), Egyptian, Hittite, Biblical Hebrew, Ugaritic and (maybe Indic and Iranian) texts that exhibit strong similarities or interesting contrasts, including several "creation myths", some fables, and various accounts of divine/human difference and the possible avenues through which humans might access the divine.So, in terms of Archaic Greek (and Classical Latin) literature, we'll be looking at the origins of Western "didactic poetry" (a tradition that leads to Aratos, Lucretius, Vergils' Georgics, Manilius, etc. -- though we'll not be reading the actual texts of those later poets), while at the same time we'll be investigating the various forms in which "expertise, technical skill, knowledge, authority, wisdom" of one kind or another were disseminated in writing (or orally) and codified in early Greek and nearby cultures.  I expect that we'll look at some medical and magical texts too, and perhaps some astronomical and scientific ones.  Recurring topics for debate will doubtless include the following: What kinds of "wisdom" are of cultural importance?  (Which technical skills deserve to count as "wisdom" and to be written down in instruction manuals and/or integrated into poems?)  How crucial, or not, is writing and the existence of a written repertoire of knowledge?  In what ways does technical skill overlap/translate into the realm of morality?  How do humans acquire (the most important kinds of) wisdom?  How different and distinctive are Greek forms of "wisdom literature", as compared with the other forms that we find exemplified among their neighbors?The seminar will include several guest-visitors who have expert first-hand knowledge of the relevant languages and cultural traditions of the Near Eastern cultures that we'll be encountering.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will start by examining the kind of questions in which the first Greek philosophers, the so-called Presocratics, are interested. As we will see, these concern natural philosophy, and, more precisely, the causes of the universe and of all natural things. Then we will look at Socrates and at the different type of questions he is interested in. These may be called “ethical questions”, as they aim to deepen our understanding of what a good life is and of what we need to do to achieve it. What should we care for in order to live well, Socrates wonders, money, political power, or something else? His answer is that, to live well, we need to care for our soul. But, one might ask, what is a soul, and what does it mean to care for it? To see how one can approach these questions, and go about answering them, we will examine Plato’s psychology and metaphysics and Aristotle’s criticism of them. Despite their differences, both Plato and Aristotle think that, to live a good life, a human being needs to be virtuous, but does this mean that virtue is all one needs to lead a happy and flourishing life? We will end the course by considering two different answers to this question: that of the Epicureans, who think that a flourishing life is a life of pleasure and that virtue can only be a means to achieve pleasure, and that of the Stoics, who think that virtue is in itself entirely sufficient for happiness. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The grade will be based mainly on submission of about 10-12 compositions, of which the 9-10 best grades will count toward the final grade. There will also be reading assignments in Greek prose and sight reading in class. In addition to attendance at class, students may meet individually with the instructor for critique of drafts.**Please note that Classics 250 will not be offered in 2009-10, but will next be taught in Fall 2010.** 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly inter-dependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary constructs such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious ideas such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.Can also be taken as Comparative Literature 151 section 1 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Through an examination of myths and religious ceremonies (including rites of passage), military and athletic trainings, musical, dramatic, and rhetorical performances, and courtship and sexual bahaviors (both homo- and hetero-sexual), as well as the emergent institution of the "school" itself, we will explore the various ways in which male and female identities were imagined, represented, formed, reinforced, and institutionalized during the Archaic and Classical periods (roughly 800 BCE - 200 CE).Among the ancient texts that we shall read (all in English translation) are the following: Hesiod The Works and Days; the Homeric Hymn to Demeter; selections from Sappho and other lyric poets; Aeschylus The Suppliant Women; Sophocles Antigone, The Women of Trachis; Euripides Hippolytus, The Trojan Women; Aristophanes The Thesmophoriazusae; selections from the Hippocratic medical writings; Plato The Symposium, and parts of The Laws; selections from Aristotle's Politics and Quintilian's Institutions of Oratory; and short works by Xenophon, Plutarch, Lucian, and St Paul. Images and videos will be helpful too for presenting some of the ancient Greek material, especially performances of drama. In addition, we will consider some modern critical discussions of gender, sexuality, performance, identity, and education, which provide useful frameworks for consideration of this ancient material.Enroll in one discussion section:101: Fri 12-1, 221 Wheeler, CCN 14820102: Fri 1-2, 80 Barrows, CCN 14823103: Fri 1-2, 321 Haviland, CCN 14826Also listed as TDPS 121, section 1.

Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street. Although these latter forms of literature are distanced from the prestigious genres of epic and tragedy, they still constitute an important part of ancient literature. In this class we will not only read a variety of texts that aim to depict "everyday life" (including novels, satire, letters, comedy and more), but we will also consider the underlying principles of such literature (what pleasures did it offer to audiences? how does it help us to understand what the ancients understood 'literature' to be and to mean?). Course requirements will include writing assignments of various lengths and a final exam.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Does it mean that one would have had a better chance of being mugged in broad daylight? Or that one had a higher chance of being caught up in an out of control riot? How many people would one see bearing welts and scars from a magistrates' whips and rods? What do we mean by "violence" anyway, and how does it differ from "domination" or "social control"? Need it always mean direct harm to the physical person? Need this harm always be intentional and illegitimate? If we are correct in thinking that the ancient city was divided between the "haves" and "have-nots", would it then be correct to say that there was something like "structural" violence in the ancient world? What could we learn from such a designation? In this course we will explore these issues through a variety of primary and secondary texts from antiquity (writ large) that focus on the mundane and the spectacular moment of violence in areas where large numbers of frequently different and argumentatitve people chose to make their homes. Readings will range from inscriptions and papyri to poetry and historiography, from classical Athens to the Church Fathers, martyr texts, and late antique literature. Secondary scholarship and theoretical perspectives will be a key part of this course as well.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

But was there ever an actual war between two powerful Bronze Age Aegean cultures? Did Hektor and Achilles ever really clash on the battlefield? Did the Trojan Horse cause the destruction of a powerful city and its people? Was Helen really "a face that launched 1000 ships?" We will explore the evidence for the Trojan War, one of the greatest stories ever told: literary, historical, visual, and archaeological. The history of the search for the reality behind Homer's epic and its scholarship will be examined as well as detailed analyses of the theories currently in play. Through reading, visual analysis, discussion, and writing - students will discover for themselves the ancient world of the heroes and their legends.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Sexuality will be defined as including sexual acts (e.g. sodomy, pederasty, masturbation); sexual identities (e.g. erastes and eromenos); and sexual systems (e.g. kinship structures, subcultures, political hierarchies).  Readings and lectures will focus on situating queer sexualities relative to dominant organizations of sex and gender.  Topics will include Greek democracy and male homosexuality; the biology of sexual difference; the politics of sodomy; "romantic" friendship between women and men; and the emergence of strictly defined homosexual and heterosexual identities.  We will read literary texts along with historical documents and secondary readings to constitute a comparative analysis of ancient Greece and 19th-century Europe.  Authors to be read include Hesiod, Sappho, Aeschylus, Plato, Wilde, Freud, and Foucault. There will be two papers and a final exam.  There will also be required weekly reading questions that will count towards your final grade.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

BCE through the 7th C. CE (roughly the period bookended by the conquest of Alexander and that of 'Amr. Monumental architecture will of course receive its due, but so will domestic spaces; and our gaze will extend beyond urban centers like Alexandria to include rural settlements in the Nile Valley, Oases, and the desert. Infrastructure (e.g., irrigation, road networks) will also be a focus, as will the movement of people through migration, trade, and pilgrimage.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The expectation set for us by the catalog description is that we should get through 1000 lines of verse or thirty pages of prose each week, and that seems fine to me. We can look forward to seeing Euripides, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Plato, and many other, later, celebrities. In this offering of the course there will be less emphasis than usual on alerting participants to the state of critical debates about individual authors and genres and proportionately more on developing confidence and skill in reading and understanding a variety of kinds of Greek - not that there's anything wrong with the former, but in general I'll be more useful for the latter. The course grade will be determined by a series of weekly translation quizzes and by participation in class.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

These texts will minimally include passages of Homer and Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle, and Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. The selection could also include, inter alia, passages from te tragedians, Plotinus, St Paul, and any other author whom the members of the seminar would like to discuss. The possible agenda is obviously huge, but the class will focus on close reading and analysis of assignments that will normally comprise no more than 10-20 OCT equivalent pages for each session. I will not assume any previous in-depth study of the philosophical texts. In preparation for the seminar I particularly recommend the following: G. Ryle, The Concept of Mind (1949), chs. 1 and 10; B. Williams, Shame and Necessity (1993), ch. 2; S. Everson, ed. Companions to Ancient Thought: 2 Psychology (1991), ch. 1.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Which animals were killed and eaten, which not--and which kinds or parts of animals were especially significant for religious purposes? What vegetables and fruits were sacred or specially valued? How were foods to be cooked, for religious or non-religious purposes? Which foods were forbidden? Why? What was the relationship between medicine and religion in the realm of diet and food-preparation? What kinds of mythical narratives were told to "explain" Greek eating habits and sacrificial practices? And why did certain religious/philosophical sects advocate vegetarianism?We will read short excerpts from major Greek authors (all in English translation), including Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Hippocrates, Plato, Xenophon; and some visual material (vase paintings, archaeological remains, etc.). We'll also look at other ancient Near Eastern material for comparison.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

A pith helmet? A leather jacket? A whip? Hollywood would like us to believe that treasure-hunting heroes are searching for treasure and saving the world in one of the most adventurous and romantic careers possible - archaeology.The reality is something quite different but even more interesting. Archaeology is the study of the human past, a window into the cultures and times from which the world of today developed. With insight into the lives of the ancients, we learn a tremendous amount about ourselves and our future potential. Today, archaeology is about history, art, science, cultural heritage, and international law. To be an archaeologist you need to be inquisitive, imaginative and incredibly enthusiastic - especially about holding a simple object that someone dropped hundreds or thousands of years ago and using your mind like a time-machine to meet that individual in the context of his life.

The grade will be based mainly on submission of about 7-10  compositions. There will also be some review of syntax, reading assignments in Greek prose, sight reading in class, and minor stylistic exercises. In addition  to attendance at class, students may meet individually with the  instructor to discuss drafts.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will cover the major myths, the  primary literary sources for them, and the historical and religious  context, and will include some emphasis on culture, festival and  ceremony. There will be regular presentation in class of ancillary  visual material (vase paintings, sculpture, sanctuaries and other sites,  and video material on the archaeology, history, culture and landscape  setting of the ancient Greek world). No previous experience in classical  studies will be expected.Course requirements: mid-term, final exam, one paper, attendance in weekly sections.Website: http://www.GreekMyth.org7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

These ancient philosophers set the agenda for many of  the questions still thought fundamental to philosophic inquiry, but  approached them in a spirit different from that typical of modern  philosophy.  They thought of philosophy as a way of life; indeed, the  best way.  Readings from Plato will include the Republic, which we will  read in its entirety; those from Aristotle will include selections from  his Physics and Ethics.No prerequisites.  Satisifies the Philosophy and Values breadth requirement of the College of Letters and Science.Required work and percentage toward grade (tentative): one midterm in class;  one  600-word written assignment; final examination - each counting for a third of one's final grade.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Since it is both impossible and undesirable to attempt to cover the entire discipline in one semester, after two introductory lectures on the history of the field, we will address a selection of topics that seems representative of its concerns.

The course presents  the basics of the vocabulary, inflection, and grammar of classical Attic  Greek and prepares the student to read classical Greek texts with the  help of a dictionary and to enter upper-division courses in Greek the  following year. This course requires a very strong commitment of time  and effort. Grade will be based on class participation and homework,  frequent quizzes, two 50-minute mid-terms, and a three-hour final.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will translate and discuss the Greek in class each day, paying close attention to grammatical, metrical, and stylistic details as well as to the larger thematic and cultural aspects of the poem.   I expect to cover about 1500 lines of the poem altogether in Greek, starting slowly (15-20 lines per session) and gradually accelerating as the semester proceeds, perhaps reaching 150 lines per week towards the end.   The rest will be read in English. No previous experience with Greek  poetry is required: but students should have taken Greek 100 or an equivalent course.Requirements:    Midterm exam (1 hour); two short papers; final exam.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

In class we will go over the text closely, translating and analysing the language, meter, and dramatic technique of this extraordinary work of theatrical literature.  We will also pay attention to the visual and staging elements of the *Oresteia* trilogy, looking at ancient images and modern videos of productions.Requirements: Midterm and FInal Exams (mainly translation; but also some metrical analysis); Two short papers; In-class translation and close discussion, with occasional quizzes.  Prerequisites: Greek 100 and 101 or 102, or equivalent.Books:  The edition of this play ordered for the class (Aeschylus *Agamemnon*, edd. J. D. Denniston & D. L.

In this course, we will study the whole of Herodotus' Histories in translation (R.B.Strassler, ed. The Landmark Herodotus: The Histories, New York 2007), but we will focus on Herodotus' ninth book (the so-called Calliope) using the 'green-and-yellow' Cambridge commentary by M.A.Flower and J.Marincola. Students will get acquainted with Herodotus' Ionic dialect, with his style and methodology, and with a whole series of diverse topics, including religious causation and characterization of major personalities (e.g. the Persian commander Mardonius and the Spartan regent Pausanias). But a major theme permeating the Histories is the uneasy encounter of the Greeks with the Persians, which in book IX materializes in the accounts of the battles of Plataea and Mycale respectively. This and related topics will be the subject of detailed analysis during this course.TitleAuthorEd./TransPublisherISBN7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

These famous works will be set in the context of the Romans' political history, social history (slavery, law, the family) and material culture (architecture, urban planning, decorative arts, etc.). 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

It is intended to expose you to the sites, monuments, art, and artifacts of these cultures and to understand the way a variety of evidence is used to reconstruct history. The evocative, yet still enigmatic remains of palaces and funerary complexes, frescoes and vase-paintings, and precious worked objects will be closely examined in terms of their forms and cultural contexts. Emphasis will also be placed on comparison of the cultures and their material evidence to see how each evolved, to define similarities and differences, and most importantly, to examine the possible influence from cultural exchange, including the place of prehistoric Greece in the international world of the eastern Mediterranean.The golden age of kings and heroes, about whom Greek poets like Homer sang, seemed all but lost in the mists of time until the spades of Heinrich Schliemann and Arthur Evans began uncovering the vast palaces at Mycenae and Knossos at the end of the nineteenth century. Since then, the quantity of excavated remains has grown enormously, revealing over 2000 years of sophisticated and wealthy early civilizations. This material will be presented through illustrated lectures and readings. Grades will be based on two exams and writing assignments. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

How does the private and public material culture of this city communicate ideas and concerns that are characteristically Roman? By studying the private homes, villas, and public buildings, we will examine ancient Roman life as it was played out at Pompeii and Herculaneum (some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world).  By using an interdisciplinary approach (archaeology, art history,  and history), we will look at how the city, the villa or the home expressed personal and public beliefs. Likewise, we will explore the vast civic and religious areas of these cities in an attempt to better understand the life of ancient Romans in the Bay of Naples during the first century CE. We will touch upon the complexities of the rediscovery of Pompeii and the ‘reception of the past’ and the profound influence these buried cities have had on Western art. Thus, this class will offer a general introduction into the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum while focusing on certain aspects of art, culture and society. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

After the Persian Wars, Athens led the so-called Delian League, originally a loose alliance of primarily Ionian city-states against Persia. In the process, Athens achieved unprecedented power that eventually led to the catastrophic Peloponnesian War. However, Athens’ hegemony was not only a cause of misery, but also the framework of extraordinary cultural achievements. In this course, we will be looking into the birth, rise, and fall of the Athenian Empire, as well as its legacy. This will entail close study of i) literacy sources, including Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War, pseudo-Xenophon’s The Athenian Constitution, select tragedies and comedies thought to reflect contemporary imperialistic discourse, Isocrates’ Panegyricus, Diodorus Siculus’ books XI-XIV, and Plutarch’s Lives of Cimon, Pericles, and Alcibiades; ii) epigraphical documents, such as decrees, treaties, war dedications, casualty lists; iii) archaeological material, including the Parthenon, the Propylaia and other structures of the so-called Periclean building program, the Long Walls, the Demosion Sema etc. Finally, we will also be examining modern historiographical reconstructions of the Athenian Empire from the 19th century to the new millennium.Select bibliography:

Hollywood would like us to believe that treasure-hunting heroes are searching for treasure and saving the world in one of the most adventurous and romantic careers possible – archaeology.The reality is something quite different but even more interesting. Archaeology is the study of the human past, a window into the cultures and times from which the world of today developed. With insight into the lives of the ancients, we learn a tremendous amount about ourselves and our future potential. Today, archaeology is about history, art, science, cultural heritage, and international law. To be an archaeologist you need to be inquisitive, imaginative and incredibly enthusiastic – especially about holding a simple object that someone dropped hundreds or thousands of years ago and using your mind like a time-machine to meet that individual in the context of his life. This seminar will be an opportunity to analyze the romantic legends, figures, and stereotypes of archaeology and to discover the exciting real elements and adventures of today’s archaeologist.The course will be class discussion primarily based on readings. Requirements: Regular attendance and participation in class once a week; several short written assignments on questions and/or topics of discussion. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

During these years Baiae, located right on the water beside Puteoli, became the playground of Rome’s rich and famous; and in 31 BC Agrippa also situated the main naval base of the Mediterranean Roman fleet there, at Misenum. By then the entire coastline south of Naples, embracing Herculaneum, Oplontis, Pompeii, Stabiae, and Surrentum, had become a resort area—a sort of Roman Côte d’Azur; and a host of luxury villas were constructed here at almost every conceivable location, even dotting the steep slopes of mount Vesuvius.The ancient sources show clearly that during this time Naples and its inhabitants retained their distinctive Greek character. The language spoken there continued to be Greek, which was (for the most part) the language of the city’s inscriptions too. Naples was the closest Greek city to Rome and relatively easy to reach; so the Roman elite flocked to it and its environs to indulge in a more relaxed and flamboyant Hellenic lifestyle than could safely be managed in Rome itself. This seminar will consider the Greek artistic heritage of the Bay of Naples under Roman patronage. Including a two-week visit to the area, and focusing on specific buildings and artworks discovered there, we shall attempt to rediscover the special flavor of this part of the Italian peninsula during its heyday in the late Republic and early Empire.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course includes some of the most important works of Western literature in English translation (the 'Odyssey', the 'Theogony', twelve plays by leading Greek dramatists (Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides), along with their historical and religious context, as well as drawing on material evidence (vase paintings, sculpture, archaeological sites).

Our progress will be roughly chronological and all of the Latin texts assigned will drawn from the Classics Ph.D. reading list, as a gesture towards some complementarity between Classics coursework and Classics exams. Although I expect that most of the time students invest in the class will go towards attaining good understanding of the Latin assigned, the course also affords an opportunity to take a broad view of the landscape of literary activity in Latin and to familiarize ourselves with and explore some of the salient issues and themes surrounding genres, periods, authors, and particular works. Our activities in class can, to a significant extent, be modulated to address the needs and priorities of the range of class participants but will likely include a great deal of translation and close attention to language in our reading, a good amount of literary-critical discussion, and a certain amount of presentation by me. I do not anticipate that we will use limited class time for oral presentation of basic information and it is expected that participants will refer to published texts for basic information about authors, genres, etc.: commentary introductions, the Oxford Classical Dictionary, the various encyclopedias, and the histories of Latin literature are all good ways of finding out biographical data, lists of preserved and attested works, and so on. Because it can be invigorating and sustaining to keep in touch with expert discussion of the works we will be reading, I will frequently provide an article or chapter (in English) relevant to our text for optional reading and as a possible point for discussion.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

But if one takes a close look at one of his most impressive treatises, On Difficulties About the Soul (Ennead 4.3-5), it is clear that he has much to say about human psychology and those basic cognitive abilities that humans share with brutes, such as sensation, representation, and memory. In this graduate seminar we will examine in detail the passages of Ennead 4 where Plotinus presents his account of sensation, representation, and memory. By comparing his observations with those of some of his predecessors, in particular Aristotle, Plato, the Stoics, Galen, and Alexander of Aphrodisias, we will consider to what extent, if any, Plotinus can explain these cognitive abilities without appealing to reason and rational resources. All text will be read in translation. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

It was always a complex and in many ways atypical region, and its inhabitants were the objects of derision on the part of their Athenian neighbors. It is perhaps for these two very different reasons that study of the region has tended to remain in the hands of specialists. But a rich and rapidly growing body of archaeological, textual, and epigraphic evidence is available to support research on the area and its many communities and sanctuaries. This seminar will introduce students to the history and material culture of the region and delve deeply enough into the primary and secondary sources to allow students to write a research paper by the end of the semester. We hope to bring a number of visitors to present on areas of individual research and expertise, with the result that the seminar will offer a truly interdisciplinary approach to the study of a core region of the ancient Greek world. Students will be expected to write a brief (1p.) response paper each week; to write one book review; and to formulate a research project that will be the basis of both an oral presentation toward the end of the semester and a fully elaborated research paper, which will be reviewed in both draft and final form. We will emphasize scholarly process as much as outcome.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will revolve around specific topics of research that are central to our growing understanding of the period and will present a combination of more general background information and the latest results of excavation and study. This course will expose you to the sites, monuments and artifacts of this period, as well as the more conceptual themes of prehistoric and early historic civilization and enable you to gain an understanding of the way a variety of evidence is used in archaeological research to reconstruct the past.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will create the universe, gods and humans, and then focus on particular heroes as opportunities to consider the scope and interpretations of mythology. We will consider how these ancient cultures conceived of deity, what it meant to be human, and how they dealt with the mysterious and the inexplicable. Primary evidence (literary references, physical remains such as temples and monuments, and iconography in sculpture and vase painting) will be used to identify and interpret the myths, study their origins and analyze their importance for our understanding of ancient belief systems. Particular attention will be paid to the role of mythology in ancient religious ritual and its influence on culture. Class lectures will be illustrated with images of ancient and more recent art, as one goal of the course is to provide the tools necessary to recognize myths and characters in art and literature. Course requirements: three exams (short answers, essays and slide identification), one paper, attendance and participation in lecture and weekly sections. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will start by examining the kind of questions in which the first Greek philosophers, the so-called Presocratics, are interested. As we will see, they concern natural philosophy, and, more precisely, the causes of the universe and of all natural things. Then we will look at Socrates and at the different type of questions he is interested in. These may be called “ethical questions”, as they aim to deepen our understanding of what a good life is and of what we need to do to achieve it. What should we care for in order to live well, Socrates wonders, money, political power, or something else? His answer is that, to live well, we need to care for our soul. But, one might ask, what is a soul, and what does it mean to care for it? To see how one can approach these questions, and go about answering them, we will examine Plato’s psychology and metaphysics and Aristotle’s criticism of them. Despite their differences, both Plato and Aristotle think that, to live a good life, a human being needs to be virtuous, but does this mean that virtue is all one needs to lead a happy and flourishing life? We will end the course by considering two different answers to this question: that of the Epicureans, who think that a flourishing life is a life of pleasure and that virtue can only be a means to achieve pleasure, and that of the Stoics, who think that virtue is in itself entirely sufficient for happiness. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Course goals include language competency, understanding of oral poetics, and literary interpretation. Students will learn the fundamentals of the Homeric dialect, including meter and pronunciation, prepare assignments from the Iliad for homework, and then read aloud, translate, and analyze them in class. While the course will focus on the Iliad as the primary text, secondary readings may be assigned occasionally to provide background and additional critical perspectives. We will also study (in brief) the Iliad’s English-language translation history from the eighteenth century to the present, and students will compose their own artful translation of a selected passage. Each student will perform this same passage in Greek in a culminating rhapsodic competition. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will focus on the poems simultaneously as literary texts and as historical artifacts, considering such topics as their literary structure, distinctive features of the genre of hymn, formulaic aspects, narrative strategies, performance context(s), relation to dedication and other cult aspects, and sociological/ideological functions.Course requirements include two midterms, a final exam, and a short (6-10 pp.) literary paper. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

After a brief introductory discussion of the problem of medieval Latin as a (literary and non-literary) language, we will translate and discuss readings from the 5th to the 13th century. These readings were selected in order to illustrate important (and interesting) authors, genres, contexts, and features of medieval Latin Latin literature and literary culture. Texts to be studied include the Peregrinatio Egeriae, a late Ancient travel account to the holy land; Carolingian political poetry written at Charlemagne’s court; religious poetry by Notker of St. Gall; allegorical poetry of the 12th century; hagiographic and monastic literature; satirical and love poems (Carmina Burana). As the course hopes to be responsive to students’ interests, this list may be changed in part. In our readings we will focus on translation and reading, but always discuss institutional contexts and problems of interpretation. Two classes will be held at the Bancroft library where we will be able to work with original medieval manuscripts. Sound knowledge of the basics of Latin grammar and at least some experience with reading (classical or medieval) texts in the original are prerequisites (please email instructor when in doubt). — All texts will be handed out (via a reader or space).7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The history of the search for the reality behind Homer's epic and its scholarship will be examined as well as detailed analyses of the theories currently in play. Through reading, visual analysis, discussion and writing - students will discover for themselves the ancient world of the heroes and their legends. Was there ever an actual war between two powerful Bronze Age Aegean cultures? Did Hektor and Achilles ever really clash on the battlefield? Was Helen really "a face that launched 1000 ships?"The seminar style class will center on coursework consisting of illustrated lectures, extensive reading, and class discussion. There will be three writing assignments, each of a different style, all pertaining to aspects of the myth and its history, such as: research, comparative analysis, theoretical analysis/opinion, and critique/review. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the pre-Roman cultures of Italy—such as the Greeks, Leucanians, and Etruscans—all made extensive use of painting in various contexts.  This course will examine the relationship between Roman painting and the earlier pictorial traditions of ancient Italy, particularly that of the Etruscans.A number of questions will be pursued.  What role did painting play in Etruscan life?  How “public” were the tomb paintings of the Etruscans, and what is the relationship of Etruscan funerary imagery to daily life?  What paintings were available for later Romans to see when they took over Etruscan cities and cemeteries?  And more importantly, what sort of Etruscan innovations, conventions, and subject matter were adopted (or not) by the Romans?  What sort of paintings do we hear about in the writings of Latin authors?  Battle paintings, for example, carried in triumphal processions, and described by Roman historians; or Greek ‘old master’ paintings purchased for extravagant sums by art collectors like Lucullus and Hortensius, and cherished as their prize possessions—to the dismay of Roman moralists.  What kinds of pictures were set up as votives in Roman temples and public spaces?  What designs and subjects did ordinary Romans choose to have painted on the walls of their homes, their villas, and their tombs?This course will present the surviving evidence for a wide range of pictorial representation.  It will include a sampling of the surviving paintings from Etruscan tombs; the earliest pictorial remains from the city of Rome itself; the elaborate suites of painted rooms found in the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum on the Bay of Naples; and Roman mosaics—‘paintings in stone’—from Italy, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean.  Some topics to be considered: the funerary and non funerary themes found in Etruscan tomb painting; the Etruscan contribution to Roman painting; the ‘four styles’ of Pompeian interior decoration; the architect Vitruvius’ denunciation of contemporary painting in the early Augustan period; the reproduction of Greek ‘old master’ paintings from pattern books; the surviving paintings of the Domus Aurea, the emperor Nero’s gigantic ‘Golden House’ in Rome.There will be a mid-term exam, a short paper, and a final exam. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

	Sophocles Oedipus the King
	Sophocles Oedipus at Colonus
	Euripides Trojan Women,
	together with short selected scenes from Aeschylus' Oresteia, and Euripides' and Sophocles' Electra.There will be three components to the course:(i) Reading the assigned plays and particular scenes closely and discussing them in class.
	(ii) Looking at the evidence for the original conditions and style of performance of the plays in the Theater of Dionysus in Athens during the 5th C. BCE.  (I will show ppt images that illustrate this.)
	(iii) Watching videotapes/DVDs (and, if possible, at least one live performance) of modern productions of these plays, in some cases performed as plays on the stage, in other cases as movies, or dance-pieces. We will also look at the statements made by some of the directors of these modern versions about their goals and artistic principles in adapting these ancient Greek dramas to suit a modern context.Weekly assignments will thus alternate between reading the plays, or particular scenes, and watching DVDs or selected clips of performances of them.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Many of these vases, still visible in modern museums and collections, have been carefully studied by scholars according to their curiosities and interests.In this seminar, we will combine the art historical approach (focussing on the major painters of the period) with a more anthropological reading of these pictures. These two ways of looking at Greek vases have often been strongly contrasted, as if they were mutually exclusive; we will see, on the contrary, that each can illuminate the other.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will cover many of the major myths (creation and the Olympian gods and goddesses, Prometheus, Hercules, Oedipus, Odysseus, Medea, Aeneas, etc.) through readings of selections from epic poems, tragedies, and other primary sources (all in English translation), along with key visual material (vase paintings, sculpture, archaeological sites).  We'll also consider some modern uses and adaptations of these ancient myths in movies and popular culture, and some of the most important theories of myth that have been proposed since the 19th century.   The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the culture and values of ancient Greece and Rome, along with a range of some of the most exciting and influential works of Western literature. No previous experience in classical studies is required or expected.Requirements:  two short papers, final exam. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will be participant driven - revolving around specific topics and themes that are of interest to the group – and will include units on domestic and mortuary archaeology. We will look at topics both controversial and "trendy" and will present a combination of more general background information and the latest results of excavation and research. When and from where did the Mycenaeans come to Greece? How was the society organized and when did the aristocracy develop? Where and how did the people live? or bury their dead? What did they believe and feel about their gods, rulers and the possibility of an afterlife? What was their position in international trade and diplomacy? What ended their civilization?    This course will expose you to the sites, monuments, and artifacts of this ancient culture, as well as the more conceptual themes of prehistoric civilization and enable you to gain an understanding of the way a variety of evidence is used in archaeological research to reconstruct the past.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

For the ancient Greeks and Romans, these stories were very often in the form of tales of the adventures, triumphs and sufferings of gods and heroes – what we call classical myths. This class examines many of these myths, what they meant to Greeks and Romans, and what they still mean for us. We will cover major myths (including myths of creation, myths of nature and the stars, the Trojan war myths, the story of the house of Oedipus, the exploits of Hercules and Theseus, the career of Aeneas, and the myths of the early Roman kings) and the various media that record them (including ancient literature in translation and visual representations). This serves as an excellent introduction to ancient Mediterranean culture and society: through the myths we can learn more about ancient religion, politics and art. We will also discuss post-ancient responses to the classical myths, from medieval revulsion to modern poetry to spectacular Hollywood renditions. No previous experience of classical studies is necessary. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle began to reflect on its norms. We know, moreover, that so-called rhetorical technai were composed already in the fifth century BCE. These observations raise a series of questions: what was rhetoric before philosophers and professional rhetoricians shaped it into an art? What were the means of persuasion in use before the development of a self-conscious reflection on their power and their goals? How did this self-conscious reflection on the means of persuasion come about? In order to answer these questions we will read, among others, texts (or excerpts) by Gorgias (Encomium of Helen), Antiphon (Second Tetralogy), Isocrates (Encomium of Helen, Against the Sophist, Antidosis), Alcidamas (On Those Who Write Written Speeches), Plato (Gorgias, Phaedrus), Aristotle (Rhetoric).7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Starting from the potter’s workshop, we will move to the different contexts of these pots : Athens, Greece and the Mediterranean world, form houses to tombs and sanctuaries.We will after that have a look at the visual repertory displayed on these pots, and the way vase-painters interpret their own world.

	In this course we will look at ancient Greek eating habits, sacrificial customs, and dietary restrictions in relation to heir religious and philosophical beliefs. Which animals were killed and eaten, which not--and which kinds or parts of animals were especially significant for religious purposes? What vegetables and fruits were sacred or specially valued? How were foods to be cooked, for religious or non-religious purposes? Which foods were forbidden? Why? What was the relationship between medicine and religion in the realm of diet and food-preparation? What kinds of mythical narratives were told to "explain" Greek eating habits and sacrificial practices? How healthy and sustainable was the classical Greek diet?  And why did certain religious/philosophical sects advocate vegetarianism?We will read short excerpts from major Greek authors (all in English translation), including Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Plato, Plutarch, Porphyry; and we'll look at some visual material (vase paintings, archaeological remains, etc.). We'll also look at other ancient Near Eastern societies for comparison.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The purpose of that fresh start is usually idealistic: to redefine society on the basis of virtue, or to make its institutions more rational than those found in actual societies. Some think such idealism politically dangerous, because liable to open the way to excessive social control, even dictatorship. This is a canonical theme of dystopian literature. In this course we will examine the classical beginnings of utopian literature, in Plato's Republic, and in his Timaeus and Critias (which tell the story of the lost world of Atlantis), as well as in some plays of Aristophanes. We will also consider later developments, in Thomas More's Utopia (which gave the genre its name), and in such works as William Morris' News from Nowhere, and Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed.Towards the end of the semester the seminar participants will be divided into groups, each of which will be asked to devise its own utopia on a particular theme, for oral presentation in class.Requirements: Regular attendance and participation in class; one four-page paper on the ancient material; one group presentation; final exam (quiz-type questions on the post- classical material).4 units.

We will be reading display pieces, not intended for delivery in a lawcourt or political assembly, but instead exemplifying and encapsulating key theoretical issues that arise from the practice of orators delivering actual speeches in those venues. The texts will be Gorgias, Encomium of Helen, paired with Isocrates, Helen; Gorgias, Defence of Palamedes paired with Alcidamas, On the Treachery of Palamedes; and the first and second of Antiphon's Tetralogies.Requirements: regular attendance and translation in class; one midterm; a term paper of 4 pages (longer for graduate students); final exam.Prerequisites: Greek 1-2 (or equivalent) and Greek 100 (or equivalent). 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

How do artifacts communicate ideas and concerns that are characteristically Roman?  This course traces the development of Roman material culture from the Iron Age to the late Roman Empire. By studying the extant remains of private homes, villas, and public buildings, we will seek to reconstruct the life of the inhabitants of the empire as it was played out in various urban settings.  An interdisciplinary approach, combining the evidence of archaeology, art history, and history, will allow us to look at how the city, the villa, or the home expressed personal and public values. Likewise, we will explore the vast civic and religious areas of Roman cities in an attempt to better understand the shared values of this sprawling empire. This course provides a systematic engagement with an ancient culture which has left a significant legacy to the modern world.The course will be offered without discussion sections this Spring 2017.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We’ll be reading parts of a wide variety of works dating from a period that extends from the early second century BCE to the mid-second century CE: comedies by Plautus; histories by Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus; speeches and letters by Cicero; epic poems by Vergil and Ovid; and novels by Petronius and Apuleius. Our investigation of these works within their historical and cultural context will leave us with an enhanced sense of some important and exciting aspects of Roman civilization. Several short response papers, one 5-6 page essay, midterm, final. Participation in discussion sections is an important part of this class. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Both authors write in elegant and appealing Latin and are major actors in the dramatic (and sometimes disheartening/horrifying) stories of Roman imperial expansion and the collapse of the Roman Republic. The class is a chance to strengthen skills acquired in introductory language classes and to gain new experiences in reading longer sections from the works of major Latin authors. Through reading of texts and English-to-Latin sentences, we will systematically review Latin forms and sentence structure (morphology and syntax) and work on building vocabulary.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will examine the role that Seneca assigns to philosophical studies in the life of an individual and, in particular, the relation he envisages between philosophy and political engagement. Seneca believes that only philosophy enables us to live a full life in which no time is wasted in useless pursuits, but while he condemns the pursuit of fame, he also praises the value of honor and of a life devoted to public service. To better understand Seneca’s position we will read, in addition to the two moral essays mentioned above, some of his letters. Throughout the course we will pay close attention to the sophisticated style of Seneca’s prose, and we will examine how and to what end he uses rhetorical devices and exempla.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

After a brief introduction into medieval Latin as a literary and non-literary language, we will translate and discuss readings from the 5th to the 13th century, readings selected in order to illustrate important and interesting authors, genres, contexts, and features of medieval Latin Latin literature and literary culture. Texts to be studied include the Peregrinatio Egeriae, a late Ancient travel account to the holy land; Carolingian political poetry written at Charlemagne’s court; religious poetry by Notker of St. Gall; allegorical poetry of the 12th century; hagiographic and monastic literature; satirical and love poems (Carmina Burana). Two classes will be held at the Bancroft library where we will be able to work with original medieval manuscripts. Overall, we will focus on translation and analysis, but never without discussing institutional contexts and problems of interpretation.  Sound knowledge of the basics of Latin grammar and at least some experience with reading (classical or medieval) texts in the original (ideally through courses such as Latin 100, 101 etc.) are prerequisites. Please email instructor when in doubt. — All texts will be handed out (via a reader or bcourses).7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

We will proceed roughly chronologically and all of the Latin texts will be drawn from the Classics PhD reading list. Although I expect that most of the time and effort we invest in the class will go towards attaining good understanding of the Latin assigned, the course also affords an opportunity to take a broad view—a kind of "survey," if you will—of the landscape of literary activity in Latin and to familiarize ourselves with and explore some of the salient issues surrounding genres, periods, authors, and particular works.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will cover the major  myths, the primary literary sources for them, and the historical and  religious context, and will include some emphasis on culture, festival  and ceremony. There will be regular presentation in class of ancillary  visual  material (vase paintings, sculpture, sanctuaries and other  sites, and video material on the archaeology, history, culture and  landscape setting of the ancient Greek world). No previous experience in  classical studies will be expected.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Together we will trace the development of Roman culture as Rome itself transformed from a city-state in Central Italy, to the metropole of a Mediterranean Empire, and finally to a center of Early Medieval Christianity. We will discuss Rome's interface with Hellenic culture, the crisis of civil wars, the creation of a new monarchical order under Augustus, the possibilities and discontents of a stable imperial system, and the phenomenon of early Christianity in a Roman cultural context. The end goal will be a broad familiarity with the Roman world, coupled with in-depth analysis of essential texts.Yes 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The course will cover the major myths, through study of an extensive selection of the primary literary sources in English translation, along with the historical and religious context, and will include some emphasis on culture, festival and ceremony. There will be regular presentation in class of ancillary visual material (vase paintings, sculpture, sanctuaries and other sites, and video material on the archaeology, history, culture and landscape setting of the ancient Greek world). The literary sources studied include two of the major Greek epics (the 'Odyssey' and the 'Theogony'), twelve plays by the leading Greek dramatists (Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides) together with selections, in a major Classical mythology textbook, of numerous other authors and texts. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the culture and values of ancient Greece, along with a range of some of the most important works of Western literature. No previous experience in classical studies will be expected.Website: www.GreekMyth.org7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Moreover, these texts have exerted a profound and enduring influence on Western civilization. We will place these texts in their historical and cultural contexts, following the development of the city of Rome from its origins and rise to power, to its transformation from republic to empire.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

This course will dive into that society, offering a selective introduction to ancient Roman culture from its beginnings to its fall, via the intimate study of literature, history, and material culture. We will read some of the most fascinating works in Roman literature, ranging from Plautus' lewd comedies to Livy's accounts of early Rome, from Vergil's epic on the origins of the Roman people to the dark imperial histories of Tacitus. Throughout, our focus will be on confronting the Romans as Romans, attempting to gain an understanding of Roman civilization 'from within' as much as possible. We will do so by placing the material we encounter in the context of Roman social and political history, considering issues as diverse as slavery, law, the family, and sex and sexuality, among others.No previous experience in classical studies is necessary. This class meets two hours per day, five days a week, for six weeks, in a combined lecture/discussion format. There will be a midterm, final, one 5-6 page essay, and occasional reading quizzes. Preparation and active participation in our daily discussions is a very important aspect of this course. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Myth permeated every aspect of life in the ancient world; the study of classical mythology sheds light on the ancient Greeks’ and Romans’ world views and can also offer us insight about our own. We still explore the Greeks’ and Romans’ myths about the origins of the world, humans’ relationship with nature, good and evil, sex and gender, interactions among family members, marriage, death, love and what it means to be human by reading their own versions of these myths in their literature (in English translation) and by studying ancient art and archaeological sites. We will also examine some of the chief theories of myth that have arisen in the past century as well as retellings of myth in contemporary culture and movies. No previous experience in classical studies is necessary.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

With six daily instruction hours over ten weeks, the Workshop replaces more than two semesters of traditional study. Students learn the entirety of Greek grammar in the first six weeks; in the last four weeks, they read selected prose and verse texts in the original, such as Homer, Plato, and Greek tragedy. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Our time-tested formula prepares students to enter directly into upper-level language classes—or simply to continue reading texts on their own. Replacing more than two semesters of regular language work, these immersive ten-week programs require a significant commitment of time, intellectual energy, and money. (A limited number of tuition rebates of $3000 are available; for information on how to apply, see below under "Funding Sources.")  In the first six weeks, students master the essentials of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary; in the last four weeks, they put their new knowledge to work reading extensively in selected texts (poetry and prose; students choose two of four options).  In addition to six hours of class work every day, students are expected to spend several hours daily in study and homework preparation. Classes are small, though, and students can count on having plenty of individualized support throughout their journey. Beyond the classroom, guest lectures from distinguished Classics faculty members offer context and insight into cutting-edge research, and regular social events provide a venue for further discussion and camaraderie. And then there is the beautiful, temperate Bay Area environment to enjoy, and all of San Francisco to explore!For more on the 2018 Greek Workshop, click here.

	2018 Latin Workshop Director: Lynn Gallogly (lynn617 [at] berkeley [dot] edu)Simply the best language course I have ever taken. The level of instructor availability and interaction is unparalleled...  Not only did I firmly cement my grasp of Greek, many classmates became my friends in the process, in the high Aristotelian sense. This was one of the best summers of my life.   - Zuri, Quest University (Canada), Summer 2016 Greek WorkshopI mean, really, I thought the Latin summer workshop was wonderful. My experience learning Greek in undergrad over the course of a year and a half felt too slow, and I think it fostered a sort of unhelpful compartmentalization and fragmentation of the language. While the Latin workshop was fast-paced, I think learning the forms quickly and well prevented the temptation to latch onto each individual syntactical category, and really approach the language as a language, as a whole, instead of something like a puzzle. It was both fun and challenging - it was a very accepting and lighthearted learning atmosphere despite the rigorous work.  - Lauren, UC Davis, Summer 2017 Latin WorkshopThe Workshop is intellectually demanding and very hard work, but also immensely rewarding...  I gained Greek language skills that inform my research agenda in political theory. I particularly enjoyed being exposed to the vibrant Berkeley classics community through the Friday afternoon lectures and symposia.  - Eliot, Duke University, Summer 2017 Greek WorkshopI really enjoyed the Latin intensive...  It was all-consuming, but more than worth it. The complementary teaching styles of the instructors and the deep knowledge each brought to the subject make this a valuable opportunity for a serious student.  – Padraic, Stanford University, Summer 2016 Latin WorkshopUpon finishing, I was better prepared than all of the students whom I later encountered in 3rd and 4th semester undergraduate Greek classes.  – Jacob, University of Kentucky, Summer 2016 Greek WorkshopOn day one, you learn the alphabet.  Ten weeks later, you've torn your way through a year's worth of grammar instruction, and you've read the Medea and one of Plato's dialogues — in the original Greek....  Considering their patient instruction, helpful office hours, and late-night email responses to my frantic questions, I can say all four instructors I had went far beyond their call of duty to teach us and really make us comfortable with the material.  On top of that, living in Berkeley and connecting with students from around the world was unforgettable. – Daniel, Stanford University, Summer 2016 Greek Workshop In 2018 the Department will offer up to eight tuition rebates of $3,000.  Two of these are reserved for UC Berkeley students, while the rest are open to all.  Applications will be assessed by a committee consisting of the two Workshop Directors and the Faculty Director of Graduate Student Instructors.  To apply, please send the following materials via email attachment to the Department Chair (eolien [at] berkeley [dot] edu) by March 1, 2018:• a statement (not to exceed 500 words) explaining your academic reasons for wanting to do the workshop as well as your financial need. It is most helpful to the committee when applicants discuss their financial need in some detail (including any current financial aid)• copies of all transcripts (undergraduate and graduate)• a letter of support from a faculty member at your current or previous institution (to be sent directly by the recommender to eolien [at] berkeley [dot] edu)The Department also encourages prospective students to explore other sources of funding.  Here are three to consider:SCS Minority Fellowship: https://classicalstudies.org/awards-and-fellowships/minority-scholarship-classics-and-classical-archaeology

All students entering program from this time forward are subject to this set of requirements. Students who entered the program in Fall 2012 and Fall 2013 may choose between this set of requirements and the old set of requirements.]Jump to M.A. Requirements »Jump to Ph.D Requirements »The field of classical archaeology comprises the study of the material remains of Ancient Greek, Roman, and related cultures (e.g., Aegean, Etruscan, Punic) in order to understand the nature and development of these cultures and the experiences of the individuals and groups who constituted them. It involves the study of evidence as varied as regional settlement data, architectural remains, craft goods, art objects, and environmental materials. Classical archaeology commonly draws on information provided by ancient texts - principally written in Ancient Greek and Latin - and thus falls within the compass of historical-periods archaeology (while also including prehistoric archaeology in the eastern and central Mediterranean).The Graduate Program in Classical Archaeology (henceforth, the Program) in the Department of Classics (henceforth, the Department) at the University of California, Berkeley (henceforth, UC Berkeley) offers both the MA and the PhD degree. A student who completes the MA Program should be qualified to advance to the PhD Program or to gain admission to a PhD program in classical archaeology or a related field at another institution. A student who completes the PhD Program should be qualified for a faculty position in classical archaeology at a college or university and/or a curatorial appointment in Greek/Roman antiquities at a museum. The Program has enjoyed notable success in placing its graduates, and scholars who have completed the PhD degree currently hold faculty or curatorial appointments at (among others) Princeton University, Brown University, the University of Michigan, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the University of Richmond, the University of Massachusetts – Boston, Mount Holyoke College, and the College of the Holy Cross.There are currently five archaeologists on the faculty of the Department - Christopher Hallett, Nikolaos Papazarkadas, J. Theodore Peña, Kim Shelton, and Andrew Stewart - who contribute to the Program in the areas of teaching, advising/supervision, and research. The other members of the Department of Classics faculty, faculty and researchers in several other departments (e.g., History, History of Art, Near Eastern Studies, Anthropology, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Civil and Environmental Engineering) (see appended List of Affiliated Faculty and Researchers) and a constant stream of visiting faculty from around the world also contribute to the Program. In addition, UC Berkeley and Stanford University have a reciprocal agreement that permits graduate students at one institution to enroll in courses offered at the other, and students in the Program regularly take advantage of this opportunity.The field of classical archaeology draws on and contributes to both the humanities and the social sciences, and the Program’s requirements at both the MA and PhD levels are designed to provide students with a rigorous training that reflects this circumstance. To this end the Program draws on the rich array of resources available to the Department both on the UC Berkeley campus and further afield. In the former instance these include the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Museum of Anthropology (which houses the largest university anthropology collection in the USA west of the eastern seaboard, including extensive holdings of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Egyptian material culture and a large collection of casts of significant works of Greek and Roman sculpture); the UC Berkeley libraries (one of the largest university library collections in the USA, which includes specialized libraries in both art history/classics and anthropology); the Archaeological Research Facility (which draws together faculty and student archaeologists from across the UC Berkeley campus, offering lecture series, a publication series, technical training programs, public outreach programs, and access to research laboratories, research equipment, and financial support for research activities); the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri (which houses the largest collection of papyri in the Western Hemisphere); the Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy (which houses an extensive collection of facsimiles of Ancient Greek inscriptions); the Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology; the Roman Material Culture Laboratory; the Center for Digital Archaeology; and last but not least a graduate student exchange program with the Università di Siena, in Italy. UC Berkeley Classics faculty direct archaeological research projects in both Greece (Nemea, Mycenae) and Italy (Rome, Pompeii) in which UC Berkeley graduate students regularly participate. In addition, the Department of Classics and other allied units at UC Berkeley sponsor a variety of lectures, lecture series, seminars, and conferences pertinent to classical archaeology. Also located in the City of Berkeley are several institutions independent of UC Berkeley that offer opportunities for research and/or training relevant to classical archaeology. These include the Badè Museum of Biblical Archaeology, the Berkeley Geochronology Center, and the Alexandria Archive Institute. Across the Bay, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco house significant collections of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Egyptian antiquities.All applicants in Classical Archaeology must apply to the PhD Program. Applicants whose highest degree is a BA (or who are on schedule to complete a BA during the current academic year) who gain admission are admitted to the MA Program. Applicants with an MA (or who are on schedule to complete an MA during the current academic year) may be admitted either to the MA Program or directly to the PhD Program depending upon their level of preparation in classical archaeology and related fields. To continue on to the PhD Program a student in the MA Program must apply for advancement, normally during his/her fourth semester.Applicants whose highest degree is a BA should have completed this degree with a major in classical archaeology or a related field (e.g., classical languages and literature; classical studies; art history with an emphasis on ancient art; history with an emphasis on ancient history; anthropology with an emphasis on Mediterranean archaeology). To be considered for admission directly to the PhD Program an applicant should have completed an MA in classical archaeology or a related field. In either case, the applicant should have completed coursework in both Ancient Greek and Latin through at least the intermediate level (i.e., 4-6 semesters of coursework or the equivalent in each of the two languages) prior to entering the program. In addition, it is highly desirable that the applicant has completed introductory survey courses or the equivalent in Greek archaeology, Roman archaeology, and ancient history. It is also highly desirable that the applicant has participated in archaeological fieldwork or museum study of some kind, either within the geographical compass of the Greco-Roman world or elsewhere.Students admitted to the MA Program should complete the MA requirements by the end of their second year in the program. Those who advance to the PhD Program should advance to candidacy by the end of the fifth year and complete the PhD by the end of the seventh year. Students admitted directly to the PhD Program should advance to candidacy by the end of the third year and complete the PhD by the end of the fifth year.In most cases students admitted to either the MA or the PhD Program receive a funding package consisting of two years of guaranteed fellowship support and (pending advancement to the PhD Program for those admitted to the MA Program) one year of guaranteed employment as a graduate student instructor (GSI) (one course for each of the two semesters). In both cases this provides tuition remittance, health benefits, and a substantial stipend. (Out-of-state students who are US citizens or permanent residents can obtain the status of California resident after only one year of residency within the state, qualifying for exemption from Non-Resident Supplementary Tuition [NRST]). Students who advance to candidacy in accordance with UC Berkeley’s normative time to degree schedule qualify automatically for one additional year of fellowship support under the Doctoral Completion Fellowship (DCF) Program in their fifth or a subsequent year. The Department provides additional financial assistance on a year by year basis in the form of fellowship and/or a GSI position for any years in the program outside these four years (i.e., years 4, 6, 7, and, if necessary, 8), and no student making satisfactory progress towards the completion of his/her degree requirements has been unable to finish the program due to a lack of financial support. Students engaged in off-campus research and/or training activities, such as participation in archaeological field projects, summer study programs, or dissertation research are regularly provided substantial financial support for these from one or more of a variety of sources, including the Department’s Crawford, Brittan, and Heller Funds, the Mario Del Chiaro Fund for the Study of Etruscan Art, the Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy’s Fellowship Fund, and the Archaeological Research Facility’s Stahl Fund.Persons interested in applying to the Program should note that there are several other options at UC Berkeley for graduate study in fields related to classical archaeology. These include the Graduate Group in Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology; the Graduate Program in the Department of Anthropology with a concentration in Archaeology; the Graduate Program in the Department of History of Art with a focus on ancient art; the Graduate Program in the Department of History with Ancient Greece and Rome selected as the first field; and the Graduate Program in the Department of Near Eastern Studies selecting the Program in Near Eastern Archaeology. Worth noting is the distinction between the Graduate Program in Classical Archaeology and the Graduate Group in Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology: the former is designed to provide rigorous training in Greek and Roman Archaeology, with one of these designated as the primary field and the other as the secondary field, while the latter is intended for students who wish to work with both texts and material culture, bridging between two of the three designated culture areas (Near East, Ancient Greece, Rome).Potential applicants interested in obtaining advice regarding which of these programs is best suited for them should contact the Department’s Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology (currently J. Theodore Peña: tpena [at] berkeley [dot] edu)  The progress of students in the MA Program (including course selection) is supervised by the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology (GA), who is a member of the classical archaeology faculty (i.e., those members of the faculty of the Department who are archaeologists). Upon entry into the Program the student selects a personal advisor (PA), who is a member of the classical archaeology faculty and may be the same person as the GA. The student may elect to change his/her PA at any time while in the MA Program. The student should meet with the GA during the advising period of each semester to discuss his/her performance and progress in the Program; course selections for the following semester; and plans for the near and long-term future. The student should meet with his/her PA to discuss these and any other matters of professional interest on a regular basis.A student in the MA Program must enroll for a minimum of 12 course units each semester in order to have full-time status.At UC Berkeley, upper-division courses (which bear numbers in the series 100-199 and are open to both advanced undergraduates and graduate students) normally count for 4 units. In the Department of Classics (and certain other departments at UC Berkeley) graduate seminars (which normally bear numbers in the series 200-299) may in many cases be taken either as a full seminar for a letter grade and 4 units or as an S/U seminar for just 2 units, in which case the student normally fulfills a reduced set of course requirements.For the MA in classical archaeology a student is required to complete 20 units, including the following:In the event that the set of courses offered within the Department during a student’s two years in the MA Program does not permit him/her to fulfill the letter of these requirements he/she may substitute other suitable courses with the approval of the GA.Students are advised to choose their elective courses with the PhD Program requirements in mind, as coursework undertaken at the MA level can be applied towards the satisfaction of requirements at the PhD level.Before the beginning of the 3rd semester, the student is required to complete one field season (4 or more weeks) with a research project conducted somewhere within the geographical compass of the Greco-Roman world (broadly defined) that focuses on the Greek and/or Roman periods. This may involve excavation, surface survey, the description and analysis of archaeological materials in a storeroom, laboratory or museum, or some combination of these. (Fieldwork undertaken by the student prior to entry into the Program can be applied to satisfy this requirement at the discretion of the GA.)The student is required to pass one modern research language exam demonstrating his or her ability to read scholarly literature written in that language (German, French, Italian, or Modern Greek) as described for the PhD Program (See Section 2.2.6. below.)The exam is set by the student’s PA. The student may sit for an exam in a specific language as often as one time per semester until passing, up to a maximum of three times. Failure to pass an exam in a specific language three times constitutes grounds for separation from the Program.Exam format: Ninety-minute translation exam consisting of one passage on an archaeological topic, with the student having the option of translating ca. 300 words without the use of a dictionary or ca. 500 words with the use of a dictionary.Exam evaluation: The exam is evaluated by the student’s PA and two other members of the faculty of the Department chosen by the GA. They can each award a grade of pass or fail, and confer to determine the overall grade in the event of a split evaluation. In order to be awarded a grade of pass the translation must represent a complete and accurate rendering of the passage.The student files an Application for Advancement to Candidacy for the Master’s Degree (Plan 1 - Thesis) form with Graduate Division not later than the end of the fifth week of the semester in which he/she plans to receive the MA degree (normally the fourth semester). On this form the student must indicate a properly constituted MA thesis committee of three members, all of whom are members of the Academic Senate, at least two of whom are members of the faculty of the Department - of whom one (normally the student’s PA) is designated chair - and one of whom need not be a member of the faculty of the Department.The student is required to write a thesis of at least 30 and no more than 50 pages (including notes and bibliography) presenting original research on a topic in classical archaeology, submitting this no later than Week 13 of his/her fourth semester in the Program. The student selects the topic in consultation with the committee chair and researches and writes the paper under his/her supervision. The thesis may be a revision and expansion of a seminar paper. The completion of this requirement will normally involve the student enrolling in independent study (Classics 299) with the committee chair for 2-6 units during either his/her third or fourth semester in the Program.The members of the committee indicate their approval of the thesis by signing its signature page.After the end of the student’s second semester in the Program and before the end of Week 7 of his/her third semester the classical archaeology faculty meet with the student to consider his/her performance in the Program during the first two semesters, evaluating this as excellent, good, adequate, or inadequate. They also formulate a preliminary, non-binding estimation of the likelihood that an application for advancement to the PhD Program on the part of the student would be successful. The GA prepares a brief written statement for the student’s file communicating this evaluation, indicating any specific areas in which improvement is advised on his/her part.During Week 15 of the student’s fourth semester in the Program the classical archaeology faculty meet to evaluate the student’s overall performance in the MA Program and the likelihood that he/she would be able to complete the PhD Program. This takes into consideration the student’s performance in coursework, fieldwork, the modern language exam, and MA thesis. On the basis of this evaluation the faculty determine whether or not he student has successfully completed requirements for the MA degree and, in the case of students who submit a letter to the GA indicating that they wish to be considered for this, whether or not to advance the student to the PhD Program.A student who has failed to complete any of the MA Program’s requirements may at the discretion of the classical archaeology faculty be accorded one additional semester to complete these requirements. In any such case the calendar for a repeat final review will follow that indicated above for the fourth semester. Failure to complete all requirements by the end of the fifth semester constitutes grounds for separation from the Program without award of the MA degree.For various recommendations pertinent to students in the MA Program see Section 2.3 below.The following is a timeline showing a student’s hypothetical progress through the MA Program. It assumes that each semester the student will enroll in three 4-unit courses in order to reach the 12 units required for full-time status. This is meant to offer a general idea of what a program of study might look like. Any student’s actual program of study may depart from this scheme due to variation in course offerings in any given semester.Year 1Financial support: fellowshipSemester 1Semester 2Modern research language examSummerParticipation in archaeological fieldworkYear 2Financial support: fellowshipSemester 3Third-semester reviewSemester 4Submission of MA thesisFinal review/advancement to PhD ProgramReceipt of MA Students advancing from the MA Program may count any coursework completed in this program toward the satisfaction of any of the course requirements in the PhD Program (including courses that may satisfy the ancient language requirements and the methodology requirement) except for the required two archaeology seminars in the primary culture area and one required archaeology seminar in the secondary culture area. Students entering the PhD Program directly can petition the GA to accept equivalent courses completed at another institution towards the satisfaction of these same requirements.The progress of students in the PhD Program (including course selection) is supervised by the GA. Upon entry into the Program the student selects a PA. The student may elect to change his/her PA at any time while in the Program. The student must meet with the GA during the advising period of each semester to discuss his/her performance and progress in the Program, course selections for the following semester (for students who have not advanced to candidacy), and plans for the near and long-term future. The student should meet with his/her PA to discuss these and any other matters of professional interest on a regular basis.Upon entry into the PhD Program the student designates one of its two main culture areas (Greek, Roman) as his/her primary culture area, with the other becoming his/her secondary culture area by default. Greek archaeology is understood to include Aegean prehistory, while Roman archaeology is understood to include the archaeology of the Italian peninsula during the pre-Roman Iron Age (including Etruscan archaeology). The student should consult with the GA to resolve any problems that may arise with regard to coursework or fieldwork requirements (see below) stemming from difficulties in defining the chronological, geographical, and/or cultural boundaries of the Greek and/or Roman worlds. A student may elect to change his/her primary culture area once only while in the PhD Program. Since the choice of primary culture area has substantial implications for a student’s requirements in several areas and eventual career path, students are strongly advised to take great care in deciding upon it.A student in the PhD Program who has not yet advanced to candidacy must enroll for a minimum of 12 course units each semester in order to have full-time status. Once a student has advanced to candidacy he/she must still enroll for 12 units if holding a fellowship, an academic appointment, and at least 6 units for financial aid considerations.There is no minimum number of units required for the PhD beyond the number required for completion of specific coursework requirements.For the PhD in classical archaeology a student is required to complete the following coursework (7 courses for a total of 28 units).2 seminars on the archaeology of the student’s primary culture area (8 units);1 seminar on the archaeology of the student’s secondary culture area (4 units);Four courses (at least two should be at the graduate level) on topics related to classical archaeology offered in at least two of the following programs: AHMA, Anthropology, Classics, History, History of Art, Near Eastern Studies (16 units); these courses should be selected to reflect the student’s specific area of interest, e.g., ancient art, epigraphy, archaeological method and theory, artifact analysis, etc. Two 2-unit graduate seminars can be taken in place of one 4-unit course towards the fulfilling of this requirement.If the student enters with an MA from another institution and has not had a course analogous to the Proseminar in Classical Archaeology and Ancient Art (Classics 204) one of these courses should be the Proseminar.In the event that the set of courses offered within any of the programs implicated in this requirement during a student’s initial three years in the PhD Program does not permit him/her to fulfill the letter of these requirements he/she may substitute other suitable courses with the approval of the GA.Before the beginning of Year 3 (Year 5 for the student continuing from the MA Program) the student is required to complete one field season (4 or more weeks) with a research project (preferably different from that used to satisfy the MA Program’s fieldwork requirement). This must take place at some point within the geographical compass of the Greco-Roman world and focus on the Greek and/or Roman period. At least one of the two field seasons used to satisfy the MA Program and the PhD Program fieldwork requirements must take place in the geographical compass of and concentrate on the period of the student’s primary culture area and for at least one of these two field seasons the student must be substantially engaged in survey or excavation.In order to undertake research in classical archaeology a scholar should be able to consult literature written in at least three modern languages - English, French, and German. Scholars of Greek archaeology should also be able to consult scholarly literature in Modern Greek, while scholars of Roman archaeology should also be able to consult scholarly literature in Italian. The student is required to demonstrate his or her ability to read scholarly literature written in two of these languages - German and either French or Modern Greek in the case of students with Greek archaeology as their primary culture area, and German and either French or Italian in the case of those with Roman archaeology as their primary culture area. This is done according to the Graduate Council’s Option 1, which allows the student to fulfill the requirement either by passing an exam in each of the two languages or by passing an exam in one of the two languages and completing specified coursework in the other. (For a detailed exposition of the Graduate Council’s Option 1, including the option of satisfying the requirement to demonstrate command of one of the two languages through coursework, see Graduate Degree Policy: Foreign Language Requirement.Exams are set by the student’s PA according to the Graduate Council’s Option 1 guidelines. The student may sit for an exam in a specific language as often as one time per semester until passing, up to a maximum of three times. Failure to pass an exam in a specific language three times constitutes grounds for separation from the Program. A student who has fulfilled the modern research language requirement in the MA Program can apply this result toward the fulfillment of the requirement to pass an exam in that same language for the PhD.Exam format: Ninety-minute translation exam consisting of one passage on an archaeological topic, with the student having the option of translating ca. 300 words without the use of a dictionary or ca. 500 words with the use of a dictionary.Exam evaluation: The exam is evaluated by the student’s PA and two other members of the faculty of the Department chosen by the GA. They can each award a grade of pass or fail, and confer to determine the overall grade in the event of a split evaluation. In order to be awarded a grade of pass the translation must represent a complete and accurate rendering of the passage.A classical archaeologist should have substantial mastery of the two principal languages of the Greco-Roman world, namely Ancient Greek and Latin. There are three reasons for this: 1) a scholar cannot have an adequate general understanding of the Greek and Roman cultures without some substantial knowledge of their principal languages; 2) a scholar must be able to consult texts in these two languages in the original in order to undertake research in classical archaeology; and 3) a scholar must be able to teach at least one of these two languages at the undergraduate level in order to qualify for a substantial portion of the college/university positions in classical archaeology in the USA and elsewhere.The student is required to demonstrate the ability to translate the principal language of his/her primary culture area and familiarity with the literature written in this language in either of two different ways:Exam format: Three-hour translation exam consisting of four passages (ca. 20 lines each) by four different authors, normally two prose and two verse. Use of dictionary not permitted.Exam evaluation: The exam is evaluated by the three members of the exam committee. They can each award a grade of pass or fail, and confer to determine the overall grade in the event of a split vote. In order to be awarded a grade of pass the student’s translation of at least three of the four passages must be effectively free of substantial errors.The student must complete one semester of the two-semester graduate survey of literature in the principal language of his/her secondary culture area (either Classics 201A and 201B for Ancient Greek or Classics 202A and 202B for Latin) with a grade of A- or better or one senior-level language course in that language with a grade of B+ or better.The student is required to demonstrate mastery of some method or set of related methods regularly employed in research in classical archaeology (e.g., numismatics, pottery analysis, faunal analysis, CAD, GIS, materials characterization, art historical methodology, or epigraphy). This can be done in any one of three different ways:Each PhD student is required to teach for at least two semesters as a GSI at UC Berkeley. These two semesters are the guaranteed semesters provided by the Department, normally awarded in a student’s third year in the program. Students are encouraged to complete at least an additional two semesters of teaching, and the Program will make every effort to provide them the opportunity to achieve this in the course of their graduate education. Further, the Program will make every effort to provide each student the opportunity to serve as GSI for at least one semester for the introductory course in the archaeology of his/her primary culture area at UC Berkeley (Classics 17A Introduction to Greek Archaeology; Classics 17B Introduction to Roman Archaeology) and for at least one semester for a course in an ancient language (generally Latin).A student must enroll in Teaching of Classics: Methods and Problems (Classics 301) for 4 units during his/her first semester as a GSI and fulfill the other requirements for a first-time GSI: attending the GSI Teaching Conference, the University and UAW Orientation, and completing the GSI Professional Standards and Ethics Online Course. A student who is serving as a GSI may take as many as 2 of the 12 units required for full-time status as Teaching Practicum (Classics 302) when enrolled in Classics 301, or as many as 6 units when not enrolled in Classics 301.At the beginning of Year 3 in the PhD Program (Year 5 for the student continuing from the MA Program) the student must chose a Provisional Dissertation Supervising Committee consisting of his/her PA and two other members of the UC Berkeley Academic Senate whom the student judges will likely serve on his/her Dissertation Supervising Committee. Among the three should be the Dissertation Supervising Committee’s likely chair. (For the requirements and limitations regarding membership in the Dissertation Supervising Committee see Section 2.2.13.) Not later than Week 3 of the semester the student should submit to the committee a ca. five-page Preliminary Dissertation Prospectus that outlines the likely subject, scope, methods, and timeline that he/she has in mind for the dissertation and a ca. one-page core bibliography for such a project. The student should meet with the committee to discuss the prospectus and the student’s dissertation plans not later than Week 6.In the semester following the semester in which the student completes all of the requirements described above (normally the student’s fifth or sixth semester in the PhD Program) and no later than Week 12 of that semester the student must take a General Exam. This exam is designed to evaluate the student’s general knowledge of classical archaeology and to assist him/her in defining a dissertation project. The exam has four parts, three of which concern the student’s primary culture area and one his/her secondary culture area. The student consults with his/her PA to formulate an Exam Committee consisting of the PA, who serves as committee chair, and two other Academic Senate members of the classical archaeology faculty - one with expertise in the student’s primary culture area and one with expertise in his/her secondary culture area. The student consults with the Exam Committee to establish the topics of the four parts of the exam and a course of independent reading that he/she will undertake to prepare for each of the parts. The topics of the three parts regarding the student’s primary culture area should each concern a different time period and one of these three should represent an area that the student anticipates he/she will address in his/her dissertation project. For a primary culture area in Greek archaeology the time periods recognized for the exam are the following: prehistoric, early historic, Classical, and Hellenistic. For a primary culture area in Roman archaeology these are the following: pre-Republican, Republican, early-/mid-imperial, and late-imperial. The student will generally spend the bulk of a semester preparing for the exam, enrolling for individual study credit (Classics 602) with his/her PA. If the student fails the exam he/she must take it again by no later than Week 12 of the following semester. A second failure constitutes grounds for separation from the Program.Exam format: Three-hour essay exam consisting of four parts with two questions on each part. The student must write an essay on three of the eight questions of his/her choice, including one of the two questions on the secondary culture area part and with no more than one question from any one of the four parts. Exam evaluation: The exam is evaluated by the members of the Exam Committee. They can each award a grade of pass or fail, and confer to determine the overall grade in the event of a split vote.The student who passes the General Exam is required to take an Oral Qualifying Exam not more than two weeks later. The Oral Qualifying Exam Committee consists of three Academic Senate members from Classics’ classical archaeology faculty, who are the same individuals as those who constituted the student’s General Exam Committee, plus an outside member, who is a member of the UC Berkeley Academic Senate but not a member of the Department of Classics faculty. Graduate Council policy excludes the same person from serving as chair of both a student’s Oral Qualifying Exam Committee and his/her Dissertation Supervising Committee, and the student should thus consult with the GA to determine which of the three inside members of the committee should serve as chair. The student chooses the outside member, consulting with the committee chair and the other two inside members. The outside member is provided a copy of the student’s General Exam at least one week prior to the date of the Oral Qualifying Exam so that he/she can review this prior to the latter exam. If the student fails the Oral Qualifying Exam he/she must take it again by no later than the end of the following semester. A second failure constitutes grounds for separation from the Program.Exam format: Three-hour oral exam. The exam is attended by the student and the members of the Oral Qualifying Exam Committee. The four members of the committee question the student in turn for ca. 20 minutes each in an order determined by the student. They may examine the student on any aspect of classical archaeology, though will concentrate to a substantial extent on the questions on the General Exam (including both those answered by the student and those not answered by him/her).Exam evaluation: Following the conclusion of the round of questioning the student exits the exam venue and the members of the committee indicate in turn their evaluation of the student’s performance, awarding a grade of pass, fail, or partial fail. The student is then readmitted to the venue and informed of his/her grade. When the members of the committee fail to agree on the student’s grade, the result is a split vote, which is reported as such to the Administrative Committee of the Graduate Council in accordance with Graduate Council policy.The student files an Application for Advancement to Candidacy for Doctor of Philosophy form with Graduate Division prior to the beginning of the semester following the one in which he/she passes the Oral Qualifying Exam. Upon acceptance of this form by Graduate Division, the student is advanced to candidacy. If the Department submits a request to the Graduate Division, the student is nominated to the Academic Senate for award of the degree, Candidate in Philosophy (CPhil).The application must contain a statement of the title of the proposed dissertation and nominate for approval a Dissertation Supervising Committee The Dissertation Supervising Committee, which oversees the student’s doctoral research, is comprised of at least three members: a chair, who is a member of the classical archaeology faculty and member of the UC Berkeley Academic Senate (and not the same person as that who served as chair of the student’s Oral Qualifying Exam Committee), a second inside member, who is also a member of the classical archaeology faculty, and an outside member, who is a member of the UC Berkeley Academic Senate but not a member of the Department of Classics faculty.Every student who has been advanced to candidacy is required to research and write a dissertation that is approved by all three members of his/her Dissertation Supervising Committee. The dissertation must be a substantial piece of original scholarship that demonstrates the student’s ability to bring archaeological theory and method to bear on a body of archaeological materials or data in order to elucidate a significant problem concerning his/her primary culture area. Completion of the dissertation should normally be accomplished in the course of two or, at most, three years.No later than Week 4 of the student’s first semester as a PhD candidate he/she must compose a ca. 5-page Dissertation Prospectus that describes the subject, scope, methods, and timeline for the dissertation, appending a ca. 2-page bibliography, and submit this to the members of the committee for their review and comment. (This document may simply be a revision/updating of the student’s Preliminary Dissertation Prospectus.) The frequency with which the student subsequently confers with the members of the committee and provides them with drafts of portions of the manuscript for their review and comment is at the discretion of the student and the chair. The members of the committee must, however, be kept informed of the student's progress and must be consulted regarding any major changes of scope, direction or approach in the dissertation. Moreover, the student must complete the online Academic Progress Report (APR) and meet at least one time per year with the chair and at least one other member of the committee to discuss his/her progress. Subsequently, the chair completes the APR, informed by the substance of this meeting, and thus reports the student’s progress to the Graduate Division, per Graduate Council policy.When the student and committee chair consider that the dissertation has been completed and no less than six weeks prior to the deadline for filing for the PhD degree (the last day of the semester) the student is required to submit a full draft of the dissertation to the members of the committee for their review and evaluation. The members of the committee must communicate to the student in writing any recommendations for revisions to this draft no less than three weeks prior to the filing deadline. The student must submit to the members of the committee a revised draft that takes into account their suggestions for revision no less than one week prior to the filing deadline. The members of the committee indicate their approval of the dissertation by signing its signature page.Students who have been admitted directly to the PhD Program are subject to a review similar to the third semester review to which students in the MA Program are subjected. (See Section 2.1.8. above.)All PhD program students are to be reviewed annually after the third semester review, usually early in the Spring semester, until they advance to candidacy, at which time they report annually on their progress through the APR to the chair of their Dissertation Supervising Committee and the GA.For various recommendations pertinent to students in the PhD Program see Section 2.3 below.The following is a timeline showing a student’s hypothetical progress through the PhD Program. It assumes that the student will satisfy any requirements with a coursework option by that option; that he/she will not take any 2-unit graduate seminars towards the fulfilling of course requirements; and that he/she will need to pass an exam in one modern research language. This is meant to offer a general idea of what a program of study might look like. Any student’s actual program of study may depart from this scheme due to variation in course offerings in any given semester, availability of GSI positions in specific courses, student involvement in archaeological field projects, etc. The normative time to degree (NTD) for completion of the PhD is 7 years (= 14 semesters) from the time of a student’s initial enrollment at Berkeley, regardless of whether he/she entered into the MA Program or directly into the PhD Program. Note that a student’s timeline may well be lengthened by one year beyond the one presented here due to residence at one of the foreign schools, the holding of a teaching position with a foreign study program, or similar.Year 1 (= Year 3 for students continuing from the MA Program)Financial support: GSI both semestersSemester 1 (Semester 5 for students continuing from the MA Program)Semester 2 (Semester 6)SummerParticipation in archaeological fieldworkYear 2 (Year 4)Financial support: to be arranged (assumes GSI both semesters)Semester 3 (Semester 7)Third-semester review (for student entering directly into PhD Program)Modern research language exam Semester 4 (Semester 8)Course 1: Course in topic related to classical archaeology (4 units)Course 2: Survey of literature of primary culture area (Classics 201B or 202B) (4 units)Course 3: GSI for Latin course or indeterminate course (Classics 302) (4 units)SummerWriting of Preliminary Dissertation ProspectusYear 3 (Year 5)Financial support: to be arranged (fellowship and/or GSI)Semester 5 (Semester 9)Submission of Preliminary Dissertation ProspectusSemester 6 (Semester 10)General ExamOral Qualifying ExamYear 4 (Year 6)Financial support: to be arranged (fellowship and/or GSI or external support)Residence in Mediterranean (e.g., Athens or Rome)Semester 7 (Semester 11)Advancement to candidacy/receipt of CPhilFormulation of/meeting with Dissertation Supervision Committee; submission of Dissertation ProspectusCourse 1: Dissertation research (Classics 298) (1-8 units) Semester 8 (Semester 12)Course 1: Dissertation research (Classics 298) (1-8 units)Year 5 (Year 7)Financial support: Doctoral Completion Fellowship.Residence in Mediterranean (e.g., Athens or Rome)Semester 9 (Semester 13)Meeting with Dissertation Supervision CommitteeCourse 1: Dissertation research (Classics 298) (1-8 units)Semester 10 (Semester 14)Course 1: Dissertation research (Classics 298) (1-8 units)Submission to Dissertation Supervision Committee of draft of dissertationRevision of draft of dissertation and submission to Dissertation Supervision Committee of completed dissertationReceipt of PhDThe following are recommendations (rather than requirements) for students in the MA Program and the PhD Program. Fulfilling any of these will render the student better prepared to conduct research and/or substantially improve his/her standing as an applicant for a university/college and/or museum position upon completion of the PhD.The student who has not completed a survey course in Greek archaeology and a survey course in Roman archaeology at the undergraduate level or in the MA program at another institution is advised to audit these courses at UC Berkeley (Classics 17A and Classics 17B, respectively), preferably prior to advancement in the PhD Program.The student who has not completed a survey course in Greek history and a survey course in Roman history at the undergraduate level or in the MA program at another institution is advised to audit these courses at UC Berkeley (History 105A and 105B and History 106A and 106B, respectively), preferably prior to advancement in the PhD Program.Although there are few coursework requirements in Greek or Latin literature or Greek or Roman history the student is urged to complete courses in any of these areas to the extent that his/her formal archaeological training permits with a view to enhancing his/her general knowledge of Greco-Roman culture.It is highly desirable that a classical archaeologist have a developed understanding of the archaeology and topography of the city that represents the principal cultural center of his/her primary culture area, namely Athens for the Greek culture area and Rome for the Roman culture area. The student is accordingly encouraged to complete a summer, one-semester or year-long program of study in and focusing on the center for his/her primary culture area.In many cases a classical archaeologist must make regular and extensive use of epigraphical materials in conducting his/her research. The student is thus strongly encouraged to complete the graduate seminar offered in the epigraphy of his/her primary culture area (Classics 220A Greek Epigraphy; Classics 220B Latin Epigraphy).In order to conduct research a classical archaeologist must often converse and/or exchange correspondence with representatives of the antiquities service, civil administrators, scholars, research collaborators, providers of supplies and equipment, workers, and the local populace in the language or languages of the country or region in which the project takes place. The student is accordingly encouraged to attain speaking and basic writing proficiency in the language or languages of the country/region where he/she will conduct dissertation research and/or in which he/she anticipates that he/she will conduct research following completion of the PhD. Various faculty and researchers on the UC Berkeley campus based outside the Department of Classics have interests and expertise that make them relevant to students in the Program for course work, dissertation committee membership, informal consultation, etc. As of Academic Year 2014-2015 these include the following:Christine Hastorf (Professor): archaeobotany, archaeobotany of ancient Italy. Lisa Maher (Assistant Professor): micromorphology, Epipaleolithic of Near East and North Africa.Ruth Tringham (Professor Emerita): household archaeology, Neolithic of Balkans and Anatolia.Walter Alvarez (Professor Emeritus): geoarchaeology, geology of Italy.Marie Jackson (Project Scientist): Roman concrete, Roman architecture, geology of Italy.Carlos Noreña (Associate Professor): Roman empire, the emperor, urbanism.Emily Mackil (Associate Professor): ancient Greece, political, social, and economic history.Whitney Davis (Professor): ancient art, art theory.Diliana Angelova (Assistant Professor): Early Christian and Byzantine Art.Benjamin Porter (Associate Professor): environmental archaeology, imperial systems, Iron Age of Near East.Carol Redmount (Associate Professor): archaeological ceramics, Egyptian archaeology.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The Classics department offers a wide range of undergraduate classes featuring the languages, history, archaeology, philosophy, religions and literature of ancient Greece and Rome—two cultures which are in some ways very similar to our own, but in many ways surprisingly different. A wide variety of classes (all those undergraduate classes labelled "Classics", rather than "Latin" or "Greek") do not require any knowledge of the ancient languages—all reading is in English. Many of our undergraduate classes fulfill L&S breadth requirements.For a full description of the courses being offered in the current semester, please go to the Classics Courses page.For more information about majors and minors, please go to the Classics Undergraduate Programs page..The Department offers a combined MA/PhD program in Classics or in Classical Archaeology.

This procedure may not be used for complaints regarding actions based solely on faculty evaluation of the academic quality of a student's performance, or decanal evaluations of a student's appropriate academic progress, unless the complaint alleges that the actions may have been influenced by non-academic criteria.A student may pursue informal resolution of a complaint by scheduling a meeting with the Head Graduate Advisor to discuss the complaint and explore possible avenues of resolution. (If the complaint is about an action taken by the Head Graduate Advisor, the complainant may instead take the complaint to the Department Chair.) Attempts to resolve a complaint informally should be completed within thirty days. At any point in this process, if a satisfactory solution cannot be reached, the student may initiate formal resolution by putting the complaint in writing.A written complaint must include information regarding the action being complained of and the date it occurred, the grounds upon which the appeal is based, and the relief requested. The complaint must be based on one or more of the following grounds:A written complaint must be received by the Head Graduate Advisor within thirty days from the time the student knew or could reasonably be expected to have known of the action that is the subject of the complaint. (If the complaint is about an action taken by the Head Graduate Advisor, the complainant should instead direct the complaint to the Department Chair.) The department should complete its investigation and notify the student of the outcome of the complaint within sixty days of the date it was received.The time frame for filing a written complaint may be extended by the department if the student has been involved in continuing efforts toward informal resolution, and the informal resolution process was initiated within thirty days of the time the student knew or could reasonably be expected to have known of the action that is the subject of the complaint. All time frames referred to in this procedure refer to calendar days. Summer and inter-semester recesses are not included within these time frames.Upon receipt of a written complaint, the Head Graduate Advisor (or the Department Chair, if the complaint is against the Head Graduate Advisor and addressed to the Chair) will assign an individual who is to investigate the complaint and to make a recommendation to the Department Chair regarding the outcome of the complaint. Generally, the investigation will include an interview with the complainant, a review of any relevant written materials, and an effort to obtain information from available witnesses (i.e., interviews or written statements or documents). The Head Graduate Advisor (or Department Chair) will notify the student in writing of the outcome of the complaint. A written complaint under this procedure satisfies the requirement of a unit level resolution process pursuant to the Graduate Appeals Procedure.If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint under the department procedure, he or she may bring the complaint to the Formal Appeal Procedure of the Graduate Appeals Procedure. The formal appeal must be received in the Office of the Dean of the Graduate Division, 424 Sproul Hall, within fifteen days of the date of the written notification of the result of the department level procedure. The Graduate Appeals Procedure is downloadable (http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/gradappeal.pdf), as is the Graduate Appeal Form (http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/policies/pdf/appealform.pdf).If the complaint involves allegations of discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex, race, national origin, color, age, religion, sexual orientation, or disability, the Department should consult the appropriate campus compliance officers prior to commencing informal or formal resolution. For more information contact the Campus Climate and Compliance Office (510-642-2795; http://ccac.berkeley.edu/).Graduate students may contact the Office of the Ombudsman for Students, the Title IX Compliance Officer, or the 504/ADA Compliance Officer for assistance with complaint resolution. There also are other complaint resolution procedures available to graduate students for complaints that do not fall under this procedure; these other procedures are listed in the Graduate Appeals Procedure.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

This brochure is intended to provide detailed introductory information for those considering graduate study in Classics or Classical Archaeology. For other related programs, such as “The Group” (Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology), “Comparative Literature,” etc., see the section entitled “Related Programs” below.[top]Two graduate programs are available in the Department: Classics and Classical Archaeology.The Graduate Program in Classics is designed to give a thorough preparation in the fundamentals of classical scholarship and to encourage intellectual inquiry and the development of original research according to the capacity and interests of the individual student. The holder of a Berkeley Ph.D. in Classics should be able to teach any lower division course in Greek or Latin, any upper division course in the language of special emphasis, undergraduate courses in classical culture and literature in translation, and graduate courses in at least one area in the language of special emphasis and/or in an area common to both languages.The Ph.D. program in Classics is designed to be completed in 6–7 years by a normally-prepared student: 2 years attaining the M.A., 2–3 years completing preliminary Ph.D. requirements, and 2–3 years writing a dissertation. Highly-motivated and well-prepared students may complete the M.A. more quickly and reduce the time to Ph.D., while students who require more time to solidify their mastery of the languages or who must support themselves by teaching for several years take somewhat longer. Students who enter with an M.A. normally need 2 or 2 1/2 years to complete preliminary requirements and a total of 4 or 5 years to complete the Ph.D.The program requires coursework distributed over at least three of the six fields of ancient literature, philosophy, history, archaeology/art history, papyrology/epigraphy/palaeography, and linguistics. Every student normally takes a one-semester proseminar introducing such topics as bibliography, palaeography, papyrology, textual criticism and editorial technique, and the history of scholarship, along with introductions to sub–disciplines such as epigraphy and archaeology, and also a one-semester proseminar in literary and cultural theory entitled "Approaches to Classical Literature." At the Ph.D. level there are translation exams in both Greek and Latin, and a prose composition requirement in both languages (met by course-work or exam). A reading knowledge of German and French or Italian must also be demonstrated. Upon completion of these preliminary requirements, the student takes an oral qualifying exam; the writing of the dissertation follows.Students who enter without the M.A. are required to obtain the Berkeley M.A. with an emphasis in either Latin or Greek. The emphasis determines the area of the M.A. exams in translation, literature, and history and the language in which competence in prose composition must be shown, but students will normally be doing some work in the other language as well, in preparation for the Ph.D. Coursework done at the M.A. level fulfills requirements for the Ph.D. as well.The Graduate Program in Classical Archaeology is intended to ensure that its students are fully competent in Greek and Latin and have a good understanding of historical method as well as a thorough training, including experience in fieldwork, in Greek and Roman archaeology. The holder of a Ph.D. should be qualified either for a major museum post or for university teaching (up to senior undergraduate level in the ancient languages and in ancient history, and at all levels from elementary to graduate in large areas of ancient archaeology and art history).The program is designed to be completed in 6-9 years (including time spent abroad): 2-3 years attaining the M.A., 2-3 years completing preliminary Ph.D. requirements, and 2-3 years writing a dissertation.The Ph.D. program in Classical Archaeology requires coursework in Art History and Classical Archaeology, satisfaction of requirements in ancient languages and in ancient history by either coursework or examination, and a written general exam followed by the oral qualifying examination. A reading knowledge of German and French or Italian must also be demonstrated. The writing of the dissertation follows. Every student shall, if possible, spend at least one year as a regular student of either the American Academy in Rome or the American School of Classical Studies in Athens.Students who enter without the M.A. are required to obtain the Berkeley M.A. in Classical Archaeology. This degree requires coursework, demonstration of a reading knowledge of one modern foreign language, and the writing of a short M.A. dissertation. Coursework done at the M.A. level fulfills requirements for the Ph.D. as well.  Every student normally takes a one-semester proseminar introducing key topics and methods of the field.[top]The interdisciplinary Graduate Group in Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology offers degrees with major and minor fields drawn from Near Eastern history, art and archaeology, Greek history, Roman history, classical art and archaeology, epigraphy, ancient law, and religion. Applicants are expected to have sufficient language training to undertake advanced work in at least one ancient language.The Department of Comparative Literature has a strong classical component. Students of literature and literary theory may study Greek and/or Latin literature as a major or minor element of their program.For information about either of the above, please write to the Graduate Advisor of the relevant program.For specialization in Ancient Philosophy, there is a joint program involving faculty and courses in the Departments of Classics and Philosophy. Students who may wish to pursue this option should apply to either Classics or Philosophy, as appropriate, and will receive a Ph.D. in Classics or a Ph.D. in Philosophy.[top]Applications are submitted electronically through the Graduate Division's online application website at http://www.grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/grad_app.shtml. The online application is available in early Fall.The deadline for all applications is December 15, 2017.Competition for admission to graduate study at Berkeley is extremely keen. In recent years there have been from 60-80 applicants per year, and the Department’s admission quota has been around 12 to 16 admits, with the expectation that 5 to 7 new students will enroll each fall. While some applicants are denied admission for lack of adequate preparation or for undistinguished academic records, a substantial number each year who are judged capable of doing good graduate work at Berkeley are denied admission through a process of competitive ranking.  The Department's policy is to try to limit enrollment to the number of students who can be fully supported through a normal graduate career.Applicants are judged by an Admissions Committee of 5 to 7 faculty members, including the Graduate Advisor. The Committee represents a variety of specialties and interests, and different members assign somewhat different weights to the various criteria for admission, which include the following:1. Preparation.(a) in Greek and Latin. Whether the applicant has a major in Greek or Latin or Classical Languages or some other subject, the committee is looking for, as a minimum, language preparation more or less equivalent to what is received in the undergraduate major at Berkeley itself. This includes a full year of introductory language study, three additional semesters in central authors or texts of each language (e.g., Homer [3-4 books], Plato [a short dialogue], Greek drama [1 complete play], Vergil [3-4 books], Republican prose [40-50 pages], Horace [30 poems]) plus two additional semesters of more advanced reading in either Greek or Latin. In practice, a student with two years of study in the weaker language is usually considered marginally prepared. Applicants in Classical Archaeology are expected to meet the same minimum standards of preparation as those in Classics.An applicant with an M.A. is expected to offer substantially stronger preparation in at least one of the two languages, since the Committee will be judging such an applicant against a real or notional pool of other M.A. students and not against students with only a B.A.(b) general preparation. Elements of additional preparation which reflect favorably on an applicant include: courses in Greek or Latin composition; especially extensive reading in one or both languages; reading knowledge of modern languages (particularly German and/or French or Italian); courses in ancient history, classical civilization, ancient and world literature in translation, philosophy, art history, archaeology, anthropology, and other disciplines that are helpful to the broad range of Classical Studies.2. Academic distinction. The Committee considers overall GPA, GPA in junior and senior years, and GPA in Classics courses, with emphasis on the last two and especially on the last. Successful applicants in recent years have usually offered a junior/senior GPA in the range of 3.6 to 4.0, with many above 3.8. A student who has floundered in other fields earlier in his or her undergraduate education and then performed well upon discovering Classics is not necessarily at a disadvantage because of the earlier record, although the Committee is duly impressed by candidates who have been able to achieve excellence in many disciplines.The Department has had many students from overseas and in evaluating academic distinction makes every effort to make appropriate allowances for the differences in grading and examination systems. Successful applicants from Great Britain usually have a first class or a high second class degree.3. Letters of recommendation. A minimum of three letters of recommendation is required. The Committee values letters that are frank and specific as to the applicant’s achievement and promise. If possible, recommenders should make comparisons with other students they know have applied to or enrolled at Berkeley. The contacts for letters of recommendation will be entered by you during the online application process. Recommenders will be contacted via email to submit their recommendation online.4. GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores. GRE scores are normally required by the Classics Department of all students receiving a B.A. in North America and of those overseas students whose native language is English or who have studied for one or more years at a university at which classes are conducted in English. Applicants are strongly advised to take the October GRE, since results of later exams may not arrive in time to be given due consideration in the admission and fellowship competition. There is disagreement on most committees about how important and relevant the GRE scores are, and some members do not attend to the quantitative score.  GRE scores older than 5 years old will not be accepted.  Code 2609 (Classical Languages) should be used to have GRE scores reported to the department by ETS.5. Statement of Purpose. The Committee appreciates clearly-written and cogent statements of purpose explaining why applicants are interested in graduate work in Classics, what they hope to accomplish, and where their eventual specialization may lie. The statement of purpose is also the appropriate place for the applicant to address and explain any particular weaknesses in the dossier.6. Writing sample. The Committee finds it helpful for candidates to submit a sample of scholarly writing, such as a paper written for a course or a portion of a senior honors thesis. (A candidate who wishes to submit an entire honors thesis should submit a summary with the application and indicate its most representative sections.) Writing samples are submitted as part of the online application. Members of committees differ in their treatment of writing samples. Some refer to them only if they judge the previous five criteria insufficiently indicative.[top]The Department is usually able to fund four to seven entering students each year.  Funding packages typically include an initial three to five years of guaranteed support, but in practice the Department supports all students who enter with funding right through to completion of the Ph.D., so long as they are making good progress and finish within eight years.  All applicants are strongly encouraged to apply to external funding sources such as the Mellon Fellowship Program and Javits Fellowship Program (your undergraduate institution and department should be able to provide you with information about such programs).Support comes in various forms. The Department has restricted endowed funds for which it can directly name the recipients: the Hesperian Fellowship, the Blumberg Fellowship in Latin, the Linforth Fellowship (primarily for students in Classical Archaeology), and the Sather Research Assistantship. The Department is also entitled to nominate a small number of candidates each year for the campus-wide fellowship competition, which includes multi-year awards such as the Berkeley Fellowship and the Pre-doctoral Humanities Fellowship. All of our multi-year packages include a promise of a year of Teaching Assistantship (usually in the third year of enrollment, conditional on normal progress through the program). The Berkeley Graduate Division has instituted a program whereby every student who advances to candidacy within normative time (5 years for Classics and Classical Archaeology students) is guaranteed a full year of fellowship to support the writing of the dissertation  (“The Dissertation Completion Fellowship” or DCF).  The Department also provides summer support (in the form of stipend or summer teaching) for the first five summers.A scholarship for room-and-board at Berkeley's International House is often available to students of classical antiquity. This grant was generously endowed by Berkeley alumnus Dietrich von Bothmer.  Interested students should contact International House directly.All students are required (and thus guaranteed) to hold one year of Teaching Assistantship, which normally falls in the third year of enrollment.  Since the Department believes that new students need to devote full time to their beginning studies and that it needs personal knowledge of a student before placing her or him before a class, Teaching Assistantships are rarely awarded to entering students.Students who decide to enroll at Berkeley without any initial support should be aware that they can only count on receiving two years of funding:  one in the form of the guaranteed teaching assistantship (usually in the third year), the other in the form of the Dissertation Completion Fellowship (contingent on advancement to candidacy within normative time).  While Teaching Assistantships do sometimes become available, the Department can only commit to supporting those students who were offered funding packages upon entering the program.  Students contemplating enrolling without an offer of funding from the department should consult with the Graduate Advisor.[top]The Berkeley campus has a commitment to increasing the diversity of its graduate student population. The Department of Classics strongly encourages applications from members of underrepresented groups (such as U.S. citizens or residents of African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American, or Native American descent) who are qualified to pursue graduate work in Classics.[top]The Berkeley undergraduate body (about 23,000 students) is characterized by diversity of ethnic background: there is no majority group. Most of the undergraduates are from California, but most other states and many nations of the world are also represented. The University of California is the highest tier in the state’s system of public higher education, and undergraduate admission to the Berkeley campus is extremely competitive. The experience of teaching an undergraduate class at Berkeley is apt to be quite different, in positive and invigorating ways, from that at many other institutions.The graduate body (about 10,000 students) is also diverse, and represents a much wider range of national and international places of origin. Within the Department, the nominal size of the enrolled graduate student body is about 32, but when students studying abroad or working on dissertations while employed elsewhere or not enrolled are included, the community normally has a size of about 40 members. When students with classical specialties in Comparative Literature and Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology are taken into account, the classical community may be reckoned at 50-60 graduate students. In recent years new graduate students have come to Berkeley from Amherst, Austin, Brown, Chicago, Colgate, Columbia, Florida, Harvard, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Smith, Stanford, St. John’s College, Swarthmore, UCLA, UCSD, Vassar, Washington, Williams, Yale, as well as Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Australia and Sweden. At present the graduate body is almost evenly divided between women and men.[top]The Berkeley campus is a lovely park-like setting enhanced by glades, plazas, and a wide variety of architecture, including some graceful examples of the Beaux Arts style. The campus is surrounded on three sides by residential and commercial neighborhoods of the city of Berkeley, a lively part of the conurbation that stretches along the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay. The fourth side rises into the Berkeley hills and a regional park. The climate is temperate year-round, with a pleasant alternation of cooling fog and bright sunny skies and an even level of moderate to low humidity. Severe smog is rare in the San Francisco Bay and especially rare near Berkeley, which lies directly exposed to the Pacific winds entering the Golden Gate.Public transportation serving the campus area is good. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system operates trains that provide direct access to downtown Oakland (which is adjacent to Berkeley on the south) and under the bay to San Francisco. Buses provide access from the campus area to many intermediate destinations. Most of the cultural and recreational resources of the Bay Area are thus accessible by public transit. These include, apart from the museums, theaters, sports arenas, and concert halls of Oakland and San Francisco, the local resources of the campus, which offers a wide range of athletic and cultural events and facilities (many either free or discounted for students), and of the city, noted for its abundance of fine ethnic restaurants, its bookstores, cinemas, repertory theater, and its unparalleled range of musical offerings. There is an excellent network of hiking, bicycling and horseback-riding paths in the East Bay hills.The housing market is tight and relatively expensive, but with adequate time and help from the campus housing service new students do find suitable lodgings to start with, and once established in the area many graduate students seek houses to share in small groups and otherwise take advantage of the graduate student network.The local airports are Oakland International (which is slightly closer) and San Francisco International (which boasts more non-stop flights and more international flights). Both are well served by public transportation.[top]In addition to a variety of occasional lectures by distinguished visiting scholars from North America and Europe, the Berkeley department is proud to host each year the Visiting Sather Professor of Classical Literature. The Sather Lecture series is now over 90 years old and has produced a number of outstanding books. The Sather Professor is invited several years in advance and is in residence for one semester. She or he normally teaches a graduate seminar. The Professor’s lectures are given on six successive Thursday evenings and are the intellectual highlight of the semester. They also provide a major social event, as the reception after the first lecture is attended by faculty, students, and numerous friends of the classics. In addition, graduate students are regularly invited to subsequent post-lecture parties.[top]Students are required to act as Graduate Student Instructors (the formal title of a teaching assistant) for two semesters, usually after having passed the M.A. exams. Many also teach beyond the required year both for the sake of financial support and for the personal and intellectual stimulation that teaching can provide. Teaching experience is considered an essential part of the graduate education and is helpful in job placement. Typically, a beginning GSI will teach a first-year Latin section, taking responsibility for all presentation of the material, development of exams, and tutorial work outside of class, though with the guidance of a faculty member. Another common assignment is as teaching assistant for discussion-sections of one of the Department’s lower-division lecture courses such as “Introduction to Greek Civilization” or “The Classic Myths,” in which the GSI works closely with the students in reviewing course material, developing paper topics, etc. All first-time GSIs are required to take the department’s pedagogy seminar, which covers both language and section teaching. More advanced GSI’s may be able to teach introductory Greek, undergraduate prose composition courses, or intermediate language courses, and lower-division lecture courses in epic or tragedy.The Department also offers summer courses, including introductory literature and culture courses and the Summer Language Workshops in both Greek and Latin. These are usually staffed entirely by graduate students.[top]The Berkeley Library possesses one of the largest collections in North America and is old enough to have an excellent historical coverage of books and periodicals in the field of classical studies. An underground library extension containing the main stacks was opened in Fall 1994, and the area of campus above it has been re-landscaped into an open, central glade. The center of activity for most graduate students is the Art History/Classics Library, located on the third floor of the original Doe Library Building. This includes a seminar classroom, two rooms of bookshelves and study-tables, and a hallway study area with Macintosh computers and laser printer, all devoted to Classics and Classical Archaeology. The Classics rooms contain a reserve collection of the most commonly used Classics and Classical Archaeology texts, periodicals, and reference materials. Students also have access to numerous other library services and branches, such the Graduate Service and the Bancroft Library (rare books, manuscripts, some Tebtunis papyri, etc.). Students of Classical Archaeology also have access to an extensive slide library operated by the Department of History of Art.In late 1997 the Department moved to the seventh floor of Dwinelle Hall and now enjoys expanded facilities, including a Nemea/Sardis research room, a departmental seminar room, GSI offices adjacent to the department, and a dedicated office for research equipment and computers accessible to graduate students. The departmental offices provide a focus for mail pick-up (every student has a mail slot), copying, advising and consulting, tutorials, and teaching.Computer and database facilities for graduate students are excellent. Macintosh computers with network connections and laser printers are available in a graduate student loungee in the Department’s office suite, in the Art History/Classics Library, and in GSI offices. Wireless access points serve the Library suite and the Department’s offices. Site licenses make it possible to consult resources like the online TLG and L’Année Philologique from campus computers and from home. CD’s for  PHI Latin texts and Greek epigraphy are available for consultation.Three research centers are now associated with the Department and provide many opportunities to graduate students.The Sara Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy, established by a bequest of a loyal alumna, has a research collection and funding for graduate students and faculty to pursue studies in Greek epigraphy.The Center for the Tebtunis Papyri, established with campus and departmental support and gifts from foundations, offers opportunities for training in papyrology and publication opportunities, as well as graduate student research assistantships and financial support for attending conferences related to papyrology and for participating in excavations in Egypt.The Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology has appointed its first Director and has been developing new programs as well as carrying on research and minor excavation activities at Nemea.The Department also owns an extensive study collection of ancient coins, most of which are the gift of Henry Lindgren.[top]Opportunities for archaeological field-work and post-excavation study experience are readily available. The Department is a sponsor of the Nemea Center Research Program and Excavations, in addition to annual seasons of research, publication preparation, and small-scale test digs under the direction of Prof. Kim Shelton, of the Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology. Prof. Shelton also directs excavation and study in Mycenae at Petsas House. Material from both sites are also available for dissertation research.Prof. Ted Peña has ongoing projects in Italy, including Pompeii. The Center for Tebtunis Papyri has sent students to participate in digs at Umm-El-Breigat (Tebtunis) and Soknopaiou Nesos in Egypt. Students have also gained experience at Dhiban, Jordan (under Prof. Ben Porter of Near Eastern Studies), and at Morgantina (Sicily) and Butrint (Albania), and often gain positions in the year-long or summer programs at the American School of Classical Studies and the American Academy in Rome.[top]The job market for Ph.D.’s in Classics, as for Humanities in general, has its ups and downs from year to year, but recent years have been moderately good in general and excellent for Berkeley candidates. The Department has a very strong placement record. In recent years most Berkeley candidates who have been actively seeking employment have attained a position. Recent Berkeley Ph.Ds are teaching at Stanford University, the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), Princeton University, Reed College, University of Colorado (Boulder), Williams College, Boston University, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and the University of Pennsylvania.The Department has a placement officer and committee and provides a dossier service for its students. Each fall the placement officer holds meetings to provide general advice, especially to candidates who are entering the market for the first time, and mock interviews are given for any who wish to have practice. The Department provides a travel subvention for each candidate to attend one joint meeting of the American Philological Association and Archaeological Institute of America.[top]For more information, contact:The Department's mailing address is University of California, Department of Classics, 7233 Dwinelle Hall, #2520, Berkeley, CA 94720-2520.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Upon admission to the M.A. or (if the M.A. is earned elsewhere) the Ph.D. program, the student in consultation with the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology will form a provisional Advisory Committee. This committee shall be composed of the faculty of Classical Archaeology, with the possible addition of others with suitable expertise drawn from Classics, AHMA, and History of Art. This provisional Advisory Committee may be reconstituted at the time of the third-semester review. The student's Advisory Committee will set the exams in modern languages and the Ph.D. general written exams; the Advisory Committee will also participate in the advancement to Ph.D. and other reviews, and offer general guidance and encouragement in the program. At a minimum, it will meet once every academic year.Personal Advisor. Each student will have a Personal Advisor; this person should be chosen by the student by the end of the first semester of study. The purpose of the Personal Advisor is to provide support and advice about studies, development of research interests, and other aspects of life in the program. The student should meet with the P.A. at least once a semester to talk about relevant issues and problems. Upon the request of the student, a personal advisor may be changed.Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology. The Graduate Advisor works with the student to form an Advisory Committee; changes in this Committee may be made upon the mutual consent of the student and the Advisor. Once in the fall (for spring semester) and once in the spring (for fall semester) the student will meet with the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology to settle upon a class schedule. The access code (AC) for registration via Tele-BEARS is given to the student at this meeting.(The M.A. requirements in coursework should normally be fulfilled by the end of the second year.)A. Mid-year review: After the conclusion of the first semester and before the end of the second week of the student's second semester, the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology will review each student's grades and course evaluations submitted by instructors; the Advisor will prepare a brief statement of evaluation to be communicated to the student in writing. The statement should indicate whether the student's performance has been exceptionally good, fully adequate, or deficient; if deficient, specifics should be given and suggestions made for improvement.B. Third-semester review: The student's progress in the first full year of study will be evaluated by the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology and the student's Advisory Committee not later than the seventh week of the student's third semester. The review will again be based on grades and course evaluations and will include an interview with the student; the Personal Advisor will attend the interview. A statement of evaluation will be communicated to the student in writing after the interview. At the time of this review, the student may choose to reconstitute the Advisory Committee, with the consultation of the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology.C. Subsequent reviews: Upon completion of all requirements for the M.A., the student may be again reviewed: this review will normally take place near the end of the fourth semester. The Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology and the student's Advisory Committee will evaluate grades and course evaluations and take into consideration the quality of the comprehensive examinations and will again interview the student, with the Personal Advisor in attendance. If the student has already met with these faculty earlier in the same semester, these faculty may waive the interview if they have already indicated in the earlier meeting that no problems are foreseen in the student's progress through the program. At this time the committee will consider in particular the suitability of the student's continuing toward the Ph.D. and in cases of doubt will specify the student's deficiencies and set a timetable for rectification and further review and, if appropriate, recommend probation to the Dean.Students who take more than four semesters to complete the M.A. continue to be subject to annual review by the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology and the student's Advisory Committee until the completion of the M.A and to a post-M.A. review.A. Prior to Advancement to Candidacy every Ph.D. student, both those advanced from the M.A. program and those admitted with an M.A. from another institution, will have a formal review meeting every year (generally every second semester) until Advancement to Candidacy with the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology and the student's Advisory Committee, for the purpose of discussing the student's overall progress in the program and giving guidance on the student's pursuit of his/her interests and long-term career; the student's Personal Advisor may also attend these reviews. Minutes of the reviews will be taken and, after being agreed upon by all those present at the meeting, kept as part of the permanent record in the student's file and a copy given to the student.B. After Advancement to Candidacy, the dissertation committee of at least three members will be formed, and may be the same as the Advisory Committee (with the proviso that the dissertation committee must have an outside member who is a member of the Academic Senate). The dissertation committee has the authority and responsibility to review the student's progress and to advise him/her of its satisfaction. The committee may set reasonable deadlines for the student to demonstrate adequate written progress in completing the dissertation: if deadlines are not met, the committee may instruct the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology to recommend to the Dean of the Graduate Division that the student be placed on probation. A reasonable deadline in regard to jeopardy for probation is a period of not less than one academic year. (Students in probationary status may not hold an academic appointment, nor receive a graduate fellowship, nor be eligible to receive an advanced degree.)The Graduate Division mandates annual review of the progress of students advanced to candidacy. A "Report on Progress" form is to be filled out by each student once per year (during Spring Semester), submitted to the dissertation chair, who will discuss the report with at least one other member of the dissertation committee and record their comments. If possible, the reporting members of the committee should meet in person with the student. The form is retained in the student's file, and at the end of each Spring Semester the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology reports the result of all such reviews to the Graduate Division.In any case, if the dissertation is not completed within four years of advancement to candidacy, the student's candidacy may be lapsed by the Dean of the Graduate Division (though in special circumstances the dissertation committee, through the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology may recommend to the Dean continuance of a student whose candidacy has passed four years). A candidate whose candidacy has lapsed may be reinstated upon recommendation of the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology only if a complete draft of the dissertation has been submitted and judged by the committee to be acceptable with no more than minor revisions, and if the Graduate Advisor for Classical Archaeology has advised the Dean that the qualifying examination was not taken so long ago as to be invalid. Failure to achieve reinstatement of candidacy within a reasonable period of time after lapsing may result in the student's candidacy for the degree being terminated. Unless otherwise specified in the Graduate Division's formal notice of lapsing, termination will normally take place at the end of the regular academic term in effect two years after the date of notification.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Please consider enabling JavaScript in your browser's preference settings.[n.b.: This the old set of program requirements. The new set adopted by the Department of Classics in Spring, 2014 and in force as of Fall, 2014 can be viewed online here.]Study leading through the M.A. to the Ph.D. in Classical Archaeology is intended to ensure that students are fully competent in Greek and Latin and have a good understanding of historical method, as well as a thorough training, including experience in fieldwork, in Greek and Roman archaeology. Degree recipients should be qualified either for a major museum post, or for university teaching up to senior undergraduate level in the ancient languages and in ancient history, and at all levels including graduate instruction in large areas of ancient archaeology and art history.Jump to M.A. Requirements »Jump to Ph.D Requirements »An undergraduate major in Classical Languages or its equivalent is pre-requisite to the M.A.; if an actual Classics B.A. is not in hand, then the equivalent amount of Greek and Latin must have been read. At the time of entrance into the program, strength in one ancient language may be allowed to compensate for some deficiency in the other.The M.A. in Classical Archaeology is offered under Plan I (20 units of coursework and a thesis).Course requirements. 20 semester units of upper-division coursework (courses numbered 100 or above) or graduate research seminars (courses numbered in the 200's). Of these 20 units at least 8 units must be in graduate research seminars (in Classics, 200-level courses with the exception of 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 245, 250, 260). Although there are no specific courses required for the M.A., courses should be taken with an eye to ultimately using them to meet more specific course requirements of the Ph.D. program (for which, see below).Master's Thesis requirement. A short dissertation of around 100-150 pages on a topic in Classical Archaeology must be approved by the student's Advisory Committee; the thesis committee, however, may include faculty members outside the Advisory Committee. The topic should be selected in consultation with the Advisory Committee no later than the start of the second year of study.Modern Language Examination requirement. A student must pass a reading examination in German and either French or Italian. It is a one-hour-fifteen-minute exam of 300 words without a dictionary or 500 words with a dictionary; the passage will be subject matter relevant to Classical Archaeology. The exam is set and graded by the student's Advisory Committee.Students should normally take two years to reach the M.A. and will be expected during that time to continue to develop their knowledge of Greek and Latin besides studying archaeology, art history and ancient history.Applicants are normally admitted to the M.A. program with the expectation that they will proceed to the Ph.D. in due course; however, permission to proceed into the Ph.D. program is not automatically given. Shortly before or upon completion of the M.A., the student will be reviewed by a committee composed of the faculty in Classical Archaeology, the Graduate Advisor in Classics, and the student's Personal Advisor (who may be one of the aforementioned). The student's course work, written evaluations by instructors, and general promise will be evaluated. Admittance into the Ph.D. program is automatic upon unanimous recommendation of this committee. Should the committee be split or deny admission to the Ph.D. program, and the student wish to appeal its decision, he/she should follow the appeal procedures outlined in the Appeals Procedure document.Students entering with a B.A. in Classical Languages (or the equivalent, meaning comparable knowledge of Greek and Latin) must first obtain the M.A. in Classical Archaeology. A student holding the M.A. from another institution may be admitted directly into the Berkeley Ph.D. program, if it appears that knowledge in all relevant fields is approximately equivalent to the Berkeley M.A.12 units in Classical Archaeology or Art History. Of these, at least 6 must be Graduate Research Seminar units (in Classics, courses numbered above 204). The remainder may be in upper division courses (those numbered in the 100's). Courses taken to fulfill this requirement may not be used to fulfill any other requirements. In addition to the above twelve units every student is required to take and satisfy at the 4-unit level Classics 204, the Proseminar in Classical Archaeology. Students should note that this Proseminar will be offered only once every two years.Must be satisfied in two languages, German and either French or Italian. Continuing students will have satisfied one of these for the M.A. Students admitted directly to the Ph.D. program must satisfy both, although the Graduate Advisor in Classical Archaeology may accept as valid a certification for one language achieved in an M.A. program other than Berkeley's. In special cases, with the permission of the Advisory Committee, a student may substitute some other modern language for French or Italian.The language exam consists of a one-hour-fifteen-minute exam of a passage of 300 words without a dictionary, or 500 words with a dictionary. The passage will be subject matter relevant to Classical Archaeology. The exam is set and graded by the student's Advisory Committee.Preparation for Exams: Reading Lists. The student will prepare and submit to the Advisory Committee for approval a list of works he or she has read. The list will be based upon the lists below. The student's exam will be taken from the approved list of readings.a. The Greek list shall include:Homer, a total of six books of which two must be from the Iliad and two from the Odyssey;
	Aeschylus, one play;
	Sophocles, one play;
	Euripides, one play;
	Aristophanes, one play;
	Herodotus, Book 1, plus one other book;
	Thucydides, Book 1, plus two other books;
	Plato, Apology, Republic 1;
	Demosthenes, De corona;
	[Aristotle], Athenaiôn Politeia;A minimum of an additional 100 Oxford Classical Text pages to be chosen by the student together with the Advisory Committee at the time when the elective plays and books listed above are chosen.b. The Latin list shall include:Terence, one play;
	Plautus, one play;
	Caesar, De bello civili 1;
	Sallust, Catilina;
	Cicero, Pro Caelio, Epist. ad Atticum 1;
	Vergil, Aeneid (six books);
	Horace, Odes (one book);
	Ovid, Metamorphoses or Amores (one book);
	Livy, Books 5, 21, 22;
	Tacitus, Annales Books 1, 12-15, Agricola, Germania;
	Juvenal, 1, 3, 10;
	Petronius, Cena TrimalchionisA minimum of an additional 100 Oxford Classical Text pages to be chosen by the student together with the Advisory Committee at the time when the elective plays and books listed above are chosen.c. The exams. The student will be examined in ancient Greek and Latin by a three-hour written exam in each language; four passages will be selected from the student's approved list of readings. The selections, normally two prose and two verse, will each approximate 20-25 lines (prose) or 20 lines (verse) of an Oxford Classical Text page. The exam is set by an examiner chosen by the Graduate Advisor in Classical Archaeology who is a member of the Classics Department, outside the field of Classical Archaeology; the exam must also be approved by the Graduate Advisor in Classical Archaeology. The exam shall be graded by the examiner and at least two members of the student's Advisory Committee.I. Description. The purpose of this requirement is to enable the student to relate the material he or she is studying to its historical background. It is met by coursework or examination in Greek and Roman History.II. Coursework Requirement. Historical seminar. One graduate seminar in the History Department, the AHMA, or the Classics Department (provided the Advisory Committee approves the course topic and research paper as sufficiently historical in nature). Upon consultation with the Advisory Committee, a seminar in an auxiliary discipline (epigraphy, papyrology, numismatics) may also be used if a research paper is completed on a project which uses historical methodology on an historical problem. Courses in Classical Archaeology and Art History may not be used to fulfill this requirement. Final grade of at least A- required.III. Competency Requirement. A student must obtain sufficient knowledge of Greek and Roman history to supply a firm historical background to the study of Classical Archaeology. Either coursework or exams will satisfy this requirement.a. Greek History requirement may be satisfied either by taking two suitable courses in Greek History or by taking a three-hour exam in Greek History.b. Roman History requirement may be satisfied either by taking two suitable courses in Roman History or by taking a three-hour exam in Roman History. Courses considered suitable include upper division classes and graduate research seminars in Classics, the History Department, or AHMA. The historical seminar referred to in Part II, above, may also fulfill one of these course requirements. The Advisory Committee will consult in advance with the professor teaching the course to determine its suitability for fulfilling the requirement. Classics courses in historical authors may also be counted as fulfilling the requirement in either Greek or Roman history, if the professor teaching the class approves beforehand.c. The exams will be essay format in three parts, each with four options. The Advisory Committee will set and grade the exam(s); the student should consult the Committee about preparation.d. The student need not choose the same method of fulfilling the requirement for both fields; she or he may do the exam in one and coursework in the other.Content and Format. This exam demonstrates the student's ability to analyze and synthesize material from a wide range of archaeology from Greek prehistory to the later Roman imperial period. It is a three-hour written exam made up of three to five parts, each with three to five essay questions on Greek and Roman antiquities. The student is not expected to show equal proficiency in all fields but is expected to display competence in different time periods and genres. The exam is set and graded by the student's Advisory Committee, who shall offer advice on how best to prepare.Scheduling. The Generals should be taken within the same semester during which all the previous requirements have been fulfilled.These papers represent the student's best work in archaeology and art history. They are to be on three different topics and may be reports submitted for courses, with such additions as are necessary. They may also be the result of independent study. The student must show in these papers a high ability to organize and interpret evidence, and to present his or her results intelligibly. All three papers must be approved by the orals examining committee before the oral exam may be scheduled.Three-hour oral examination, given by a committee of five members. The orals committee will be selected by the student in consultation with the Graduate Advisor. It is the student's responsibility to solicit orals committee members and to keep them informed about plans for the orals examination. During the exam, the student will be questioned chiefly, but not exclusively, on points raised by his or her written examination. The chair and outside member of the Qualifying Examination must be members of the Academic Senate.Students are encouraged to travel and to take part in excavations. At an appropriate point in his or her academic career, the student shall (if possible) spend at least one year as a regular student of either the American Academy in Rome or the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, or at some other approved institute abroad. If this is impossible, the committee shall direct the student to a suitable program of work abroad.After passing the oral qualifying exam, and submitting the required forms to the Graduate Division, the student is formally Advanced to Candidacy and is awarded the degree of "Candidate in Philosophy" (C.Phil.) while working on his or her dissertation.A dissertation must be completed. A description of the research, reports to the committee, etc., for the dissertation in Classical Archaeology is available from the Classics Department. The dissertation committee members are selected by the student in consultation with the Graduate Advisor. The chair and outside member of the dissertation committee must be members of the Academic Senate. For University Regulations on format, etc., ask the Graduate Division for a copy of their booklet, "Guidelines for Preparing a Doctoral Dissertation or Master's Thesis."From the M.A. to advancement to doctoral candidacy should take two to three years; the dissertation will normally take 2 years to write.In the year immediately following the M.A. (if that degree is taken at Berkeley) or during the first 2-3 years of Ph.D. study (if the M.A. is earned elsewhere), the student is guaranteed at least one year's employment as a Graduate Student Instructor.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Students are admitted for the M.A. only as a step toward the Ph.D. Students are expected to have completed before admission at least the equivalent of the undergraduate major in Classical Languages and are strongly urged to supplement these minimum requirements with two or three additional senior reading courses in Greek or Latin and with courses in Intermediate or Advanced Prose Composition. It is also recommended that students acquire an adequate reading knowledge of German and/or French or Italian before admission if possible.1.1. (4 units) either the Proseminar (Classics 200) or Approaches to Literature (Classics 203). Exemption from this requirement may be authorized by the Graduate Advisor (GA) only when a student has taken a course equivalent to either Classics 200 or Classics 203 elsewhere. If exemption is granted, then 4 additional units are required under 1.2 or 1.3.1.2. (4 units) a seminar in the Classics Department, in a Greek subject for the Greek emphasis or in a Latin subject for the Latin emphasis.1.3. (4 units) an additional seminar in Classics or a closely-related field.1.4. 12 units in upper division courses in Greek, Latin, or closely-related fields or in graduate courses in Classics or in closely-related fields.1.5. DEFINITION: “Graduate course” includes all courses numbered in the 200-series; “seminar” includes graduate courses other than those numbered 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 250, 260, 298, 299. Courses in the 300-series do not count as “graduate courses” or “seminars” for the purposes of these requirements.1.6. Students should note that Classics 200 and Classics 203 are both required for the Ph.D. (see Ph.D. regulations 7.2.2), and it is recommended that these courses be taken as early in one’s graduate career as possible.2.1. Translation, literature, and history:2.1.1. EITHER for the Greek emphasis:
	a. Greek translation: 3-hour exam.
	b. Greek literature: 2-hour exam.
	c. Greek history: 3-hour exam.2.1.2. OR for the Latin emphasis:
	a. Latin translation: 3-hour exam.
	b. Latin literature: 2-hour exam.
	c. Roman history: 3-hour exam.2.1.3. The comprehensive examination consists of the set of exams in translation, literature, and history. In the interest of rapid progress through the program, students may take individual exams as soon as they feel ready to do so. In the event that any of the exams are failed only the failed exams have to be retaken.2.1.4. At the beginning of the semester in which the student intends to complete the last of these exams (or equivalent coursework), the student must notify the GA of impending completion of M.A. requirements; the GA will then notify Graduate Division of the student’s advancement to candidacy for the M.A.2.1.5. Substitution of coursework for the history exam:  Any student may satisfy the M.A. requirement in history by taking History 105a or 105b (for the Greek emphasis), or History 106a or 106b (for the Latin emphasis), with the following conditions:  the student must 1) take the final exam and 2) receive a course grade of at least A-.2.2. Composition: Competence must be demonstrated either2.2.1. by passing a take-home exam in prose composition in Greek (for the M.A. with Greek emphasis) or in Latin (for the M.A. with Latin emphasis), with a proficiency equivalent to the standard of the grade B (composition exams are administered by the Ph.D. committee), or2.2.2. by completing with at least a grade of B Classics 250 (for the M.A. with Greek emphasis) or 260 (for the M.A. with Latin emphasis).2.3 German or French or Italian: One-hour-fifteen-minute exam to test reading ability:  for French or Italian, a passage of 500 words with the use of a dictionary or of 300 words without a dictionary; for German, a passage of 400 words with the use of a dictionary or of 240 words without a dictionary. This exam must be attempted by the end of the third semester in the M.A. program and if not passed at that time must be repeated in every subsequent semester until passed. (It is strongly recommended that students who enter the program without knowledge of any of the three languages attempt to achieve competency in German first.)  NOTE: These examinations are set and judged by the Ph.D. Committee.3.1. The M.A. requirements in coursework and exams should normally be fulfilled by the end of the second year (four semesters). Failure to complete the M.A. by the end of the third year will be considered evidence of inadequate progress and is likely to lead to academic probation or denial of permission to proceed to the Ph.D.3.2. Reviews. Provisions for review of students at regular intervals during their M.A. program are described in the section “Advising and Reviews” (17 below).Each student receives guidance from the Graduate Advisor and also from a Personal Advisor. See the section “Advising and Reviews” (16 below).Admission to the M.A. program does not guarantee advancement to the Ph.D. program (see Ph.D. regulations 6.3 and 17.3 below). A student who earns an M.A. with Greek or Latin emphasis cannot be advanced to the Ph.D. program unless competence has been demonstrated in the non-emphasized language at least equivalent to that required to complete the undergraduate major in Classical Languages. The student has the right to demonstrate such competence by taking an exam (e.g. the M.A. translation exam in the non-emphasized language).The program of studies which leads to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Classics at Berkeley is designed to give a thorough preparation in the fundamentals of classical scholarship while encouraging the pursuit of intellectual enquiry and the development of original research according to the capacity and interests of the individual student. The examination and course requirements which every student must satisfy before being advanced to candidacy to write a dissertation are intended to ensure attainment, up to at least the minimum level essential for a Classical scholar, of specific skills and all-round competence in the languages (ancient and modern), in the history, literature, and culture of ancient Greece and Rome, in the fundamental techniques of scholarship, and in the ability to sustain informed and penetrating discussion; the dissertation is intended to demonstrate the student’s ability to make a successfully independent and original contribution to research.In addition the program has a practical professional aim. The holder of a Berkeley Ph.D. in Classics should be able to teach any lower division course in Greek or Latin, any upper division course in the language of special emphasis, and graduate courses in at least one area in the language of special emphasis and/or in an area common to both languages. This is the minimal aim, but all will be encouraged to go beyond it.Students are expected to complete their oral qualifying examination and advance to candidacy by the 10th semester and complete their degree within 14 semesters or seven years.6.1 Students new to UC Berkeley who have an M.A. in Greek, Latin or Classics or equivalent preparation may be admitted to the Ph.D. program by the departmental admissions committee.6.2. Enrolled Berkeley graduate students wishing to transfer to Classics from another major are required to present their request to the same committee, which will consider the candidate in the context of the pool of new applicants evaluated each January.6.3. Students in the UC Berkeley M.A. program will be reviewed, upon completion of their M.A. examinations and course requirements, to determine whether or not they may proceed to the Ph.D. For details, see 17.3 below under “Advising and Reviews.”7.1. Unit RequirementThe doctoral degree program will ordinarily involve completion, with a satisfactory grade (“B” or higher), of at least 64 units of course work between the beginning of the M.A. program and advancement to candidacy (for new students entering the program directly the GA may grant credit for equivalent courses completed satisfactorily elsewhere). The following paragraphs specify requirements that ensure a requisite degree of breadth and range in the student’s preparation.7.2. Graduate seminars7.2.1. DEFINITION: Most Classics seminars (and some seminars in related departments) may be taken in one of two different ways:1) as “P” seminars, with the requirement of a final paper (or an equivalent workload, such as a final examination, as designated by the instructor) to be presented to the instructor and assessed as part of the final grade. P-seminars carry 4 units, with a regular letter grade.2) as “X” seminars, requiring full participation in the course but no paper (or equivalent as described under 1) above). X-seminars carry 2 units, and are normally taken for an S/U grade only, except that arrangement may be made with the instructor beforehand, at the instructor’s discretion, for a letter grade to be given. Where the regulations below refer to “P-seminars, or the equivalent number of X-seminars,” one P-seminar = two X-seminars.7.2.2. Proseminars. Every student must complete satisfactorily Classics 200, the Proseminar, and Classics 203, Approaches to Literature. Exemption from either of these may be authorized by the GA only when a student has taken an equivalent course elsewhere; instead of Classics 203, a student may take an equivalent course in another department, but such equivalent shall not count toward the seminar requirement under 7.2.3 below. Classics 200 and Classics 203 will be offered in alternate years and students are encouraged to take each course the first time they have the opportunity (during the M.A. years, if applicable).7.2.3. Total seminar units. Every student must complete satisfactorily at least 40 units (10 graduate level P-seminars, or an equivalent mixture of P- and X-seminars), in Classics (or, occasionally, in an approved related field) in the 200 series. Courses numbered 200, 250, 260, 298, 299 do not count for this purpose; the survey courses (Classics 201 and 202) and Classics 203 [but not a non-Classics equivalent of 203] do count toward this total but not toward any of the following requirements.7.2.4. at least 5 P-seminars must be completed with a grade of A- or higher.7.2.5. Language distribution. At least 16 units shall be completed satisfactorily in Greek subjects, and at least 16 units shall be completed satisfactorily in Latin subjects: of these one P-seminar in a Greek subject (4 units) and one P-seminar in a Latin subject (4 units) must be taken in the Classics Dept.; for the remaining 12 units in each area any combination of P- and X- seminars is permitted, and any one course (4 units) chosen from among 201A, 201B or 250 may be counted toward the Greek total, and any one course (4 units) chosen from among 202A, 202B or 260 may be counted toward the Latin total.7.2.6. Breadth. At least five P-seminars shall be completed satisfactorily in at least three of the following six fields, with at least two in a single field: (1) archaeology/art history, (2) history, (3) linguistics, (4) literature, (5) papyrology/epigraphy/palaeography, and (6) philosophy.7.2.7. NOTE: Units in 300-level courses and in 601 and 602 do not count toward residency or degree requirements; there is no limit on the total number of the 600 level units, but no more than 8 such units are allowed in any one semester.8.1. Greek translation exam: a 3-hour exam of prescribed texts. The passages are taken from a selection of texts comprising the Common List (as drawn up and published by the Department from time to time: see List).8.2. Latin translation exam: a 3-hour exam of prescribed texts. The passages are taken from a selection of texts comprising the Common List (see List).8.3. Greek and Latin Prose Composition. Competence must be demonstrated in each language, either 1) by passing the take-home exam set by the Ph.D. Committee, or 2) by completing the Advanced Prose Composition Course (250 or 260) with a grade of at least A-. NOTE: Continuing Berkeley students may already have satisfied this requirement in one language in earning the M.A.8.4. German and either French or Italian reading ability. For details, see 2.3 above. NOTE:  Continuing Berkeley students will already have satisfied this requirement in at least one language in earning the M.A.8.5. Time-table for completing exams8.5.1. It is strongly recommended that students attempt the language exam in one ancient language during the first year after advancement or admission to the Ph.D. program, and the exam in the other language the following year.8.5.2. New students entering the Ph.D. program directly must attempt the examination in their first modern language no later than the second enrolled semester in the Ph.D. program. For all students, the examination in the second modern foreign language must be attempted for the first time no later than the third enrolled semester in the Ph.D. program.8.5.3 Failure to pass any one or more of the required exams by the end of the sixth enrolled semester following advancement from the M.A. to the Ph.D. program, or by the end of the eighth semester for those who enter with an M.A., will normally be interpreted as inadequate progress and may result in a warning, with the possibility that the student may later be placed on academic probation.9.1. By the beginning of the third semester after completion of the M.A. (or after admission for those admitted with an M.A.), students must have constructed an Individual Reading List in consultation either with their Personal Advisor or with another suitable faculty member. The List must total not less than 300 pages of Oxford Text (or equivalent). (1000 lines of verse is to be taken as the equivalent of 33 pages of prose.) For the sake of individual flexibility, however, no restriction is imposed on the number of authors covered, nor on the proportion of Greek to Latin. After approval by the GA, the List will form part of the student’s file, and progress on completing it will be monitored by the GA and by the faculty member originally consulted. The List will be presented to the student’s Oral Examination Committee when the committee is constituted. Changes to the list may be made up until that time. The list will be taken into account by the Committee in their conduct of the examination.9.2. Every student will submit, not later than the beginning of the third semester after completing the M.A. (or after admission for those admitted with an M.A.), a short “Statement of Intended Research” [SIR] of no more than 5 pages (including bibliography), outlining the general topic, approach and main primary and secondary readings that the student has in mind for the dissertation. This SIR will normally be submitted in conjunction with the student’s Individual Reading List. The student shall choose a committee of three faculty (at least two of them members of the Classics Department) to review and approve the SIR: this process of review shall include a meeting (no longer than one hour) to discuss the SIR and the student’s plans. This meeting should normally take place before the sixth week of the semester in which the SIR was submitted. The SIR may be subsequently modified—even quite radically—in the following months and years, with the approval of the faculty committee. (In the event that the topic or approach evolves into something significantly different from the original SIR, the student may wish to reconstitute the faculty membership of their committee.) The SIR will eventually be used as the basis for discussion of the student’s Special Field in the PhD oral qualifying exam.10.1. Every student is required to submit to the orals committee (see 11.2) at least three papers in various fields of classical study demonstrating competence in methods of research, in the preparation of bibliographies, and in expository writing. One paper must include a close reading of a selected piece or pieces of Greek or Latin prose or poetry. One paper must be in the area of the proposed dissertation; or as an alternative to such a paper, the student may submit in its place a brief statement of interest concerning the probable area of dissertation research (3-10 pages in length, with an added bibliography of 2 or more pages)Papers are to be written in an acceptable scholarly form, with documentation provided in footnotes or endnotes; a consistent scholarly style, such as would be acceptable in a scholarly periodical or other publication, should be maintained (the standard of style of Classical Antiquity is recommended but not required). Seminar papers may be submitted in unchanged form if the name of the professor as well as his/her comments on the paper (in their entirety) are included.10.2. Papers (including the alternative statement of interest) may be submitted to the GA at any time, but all three items must be in the student’s file no later than two weeks after notification that the final written examination has been passed and the requisite courses and units completed.10.3. The orals committee will review the items submitted and approve them before the oral examination takes place, and will notify the GA before the oral examination of any deficiencies found in them. If an item is judged not to be in suitable form, or not to be of sufficient quality, the committee may require it to be rewritten and resubmitted before proceeding with the oral examination.11.1. The oral examination and advancement to candidacy should take place no later than the tenth semester. (A student taking the oral examination and advancing in the 11th semester or later will not be eligible for the Doctoral Completion Fellowship.) It should be scheduled as soon as possible after completion of all the written examinations and unit and course requirements: a student completing the requirements in the Fall Semester must take the oral no later than the 12th week of the following Spring Semester; a student completing the requirements in the Spring Semester must take the oral no later than the 5th week of the following Fall Semester.11.2. The orals committee. After consultation with the student, and taking cognizance of the distribution of the student’s work among the six fields listed in 7.2.6 above and the relative degree of concentration on Greek and Latin, the GA will recommend to the Graduate Division a committee of 4 members (3 of whom are Academic Senate faculty of the Classics Dept., one of whom is an Academic Senate member in another department) to conduct the oral exam. The chair of the oral examination cannot serve as the chair of the student’s dissertation committee. The committee will normally be selected within two weeks after notification that the final written examination has been passed and course and unit requirements met, and will be advised at once to review the items submitted by the student and to notify the GA as promptly as possible of any deficiencies found in them.11.3. Emphasis and scope of examination. In accordance with Graduate Council policy, at least three distinct areas are to be covered in this examination. For the purposes of the oral examination, each of the six fields listed in 7.2.6 is divided into two parts, Greek and Roman (or Latin). Students choose to be examined either in two parts of one field and one of a different field, or in three parts of three different fields (e.g. Greek literature or Roman history or Greek archaeology or Latin linguistics), with the proviso that no candidate may focus for the entire exam on areas that involve only Greek texts or only Latin texts. Papyrology/ epigraphy/ paleography is divided for this purpose into four sub-sections, any two of which are held to constitute one part of the field: papyrology, Greek epigraphy, Roman epigraphy, paleography. Philosophy is divided for this purpose into four sub-sections, any two of which are held to constitute one part of the field: Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, post-Aristotelian philosophy. The student will also be examined in a special field connected to the probable area of his or her dissertation, as delineated in the Statement of Intended Research (9.2 above). This special field will usually be part of one of the broader fields just specified, and the designation of the special field is to be developed in consultation with the GA. The inclusion of the special field in the oral examination is intended to allow the student to demonstrate satisfactory plans and preparation in the proposed area of the dissertation topic. In their conduct of the examination, the examiners will also take into account the contents of the student’s Individual Reading List (9.1 above).11.4. Judging of the oral examination shall conform to the rules set forth by the Graduate Council.11.5. Upon successful completion of this examination the student shall be eligible for award of the degree of Candidate in Philosophy (see 12.2.).12.1. Nature and scope. A dissertation is expected to be a full and original exposition of some aspect of classical study that has not previously been treated with the same fullness or from the same standpoint, and to demonstrate the ability to use the full range of methods and materials of classical scholarship in an enterprise of considerable scope, largely on the student’s own initiative.12.2. Selection of topic and supervising committee. As soon as possible after passing the oral qualifying examination, the student must file with the Graduate Division an Application for Advancement to Candidacy for Doctor of Philosophy. The application must contain a statement of the title of the proposed dissertation and nominate for approval a supervising committee consisting of three Academic Senate members, one of whom is from a department other than Classics. The function of the committee is to guide the candidate in research and judge the merits of the dissertation. It is the policy of the Graduate Division that the chair of this supervising committee not be the same as the chair of the oral qualifying examination committee (11.2 above). Selection of the chair and the other two members of the dissertation committee is made by the student in consultation with the GA, but is subject to the approval of the Graduate Division, which is formally responsible for the appointment of the dissertation committee on behalf of the Graduate Council. Following appointment of the supervising committee the student is required to confer with all three members before undertaking the work of a dissertation. The frequency with which the student confers with the three members of the committee is at the discretion of the student and the committee chair; however, members of the committee must be kept informed of the student’s progress and must be consulted before any major changes of scope, direction or approach are made in the dissertation. Advanced candidates are reviewed annually (see “Advising and Reviews,” 18.2 below). Should it become necessary, in the opinion of the GA and the student, to replace a member of the supervising committee (e.g. because the member has left the University, or because of irreconcilable disagreement among the committee members and the student about the direction which the dissertation should take), the GA, after consultation with all three members of the committee, will apply to the Graduate Division for reconstitution of the committee, suggesting a replacement member. If at any stage in the writing of the dissertation the student and the GA are unable to agree on the constitution of the committee, the student has the right to appeal to the Department chair, or finally to the Dean of the Graduate Division.12.3. Disssertation Colloquium. Each year the Graduate Advisor or a designated faculty member will supervise a year-long colloquium for those beginning to work on their dissertations. This colloquium will provide presentations intended to help the students proceed quickly and effectively to writing, covering such issues as how to define a topic (narrowing or expanding), how to structure a dissertation, effective research practices, effective writing practices and strategies. In addition, the students will present their work in progress. Every student will be required to participate in this colloquium in the year after advancement to candidacy. (Exceptions or postponements for those not in Berkeley or for those wishing to avail themselves of alternative dissertation-writing workshops are to be approved in advance by the GA and the dissertation supervisor.)12.4. Satisfactory progress. Provisions for review of students advanced to candidacy and details about probation and lapsing of candidacy in cases of unsatisfactory progress are contained in the separate section “Advising and Reviews” (see 18.2 below).12.5. Final approval. When the student, after consultation with the chair of the dissertation committee, considers that the dissertation has been completed satisfactorily, a final version shall be submitted to the committee for approval. Responsibility for placing the completed dissertation in the hands of the committee members rests with the student. If all three members of the committee approve the dissertation, they sign the official title page. The student is responsible for submitting an official version of the dissertation and any required ancillary documents in accordance with Graduate Division rules and requirements. (Consult the Policies and Procedures area of the Graduate Division web site for Dissertation Filing Guidelines.) For the procedure to be followed in the rare event that the committee members find, upon submission of a near final draft of the dissertation, that the work is not likely to be accepted without major alterations in either the research or the written presentation (i.e. more than minor revisions or editorial changes), consult the Policies and Procedures section of the Graduate Division web site (Guide to Graduate Policy, Appendix A, §8).13.1. Normative Time (NT), recommended by the Department and approved by the Graduate Council, serves as the Graduate Division’s basis for determining eligibility for the Dean’s Normative Time Fellowship (DNTF) or (for cohorts beginning from Fall 2010 onward) the Doctoral Completion Fellowship (DCF). For Classics graduate students, Normative Time is as follows:13.2. The DCF program contains the provision that students who receive DCF may not receive any further support from any campus unit (fellowship, GSIship, GSRship, or other campus employment) after NT + 1 (that is, after 8 years or 16 semesters for Classics).13.3 Students who do not qualify for (or do not accept) DCF are governed by the departmental funding policy, which is to support all students who are making normal progress for up to 6 semesters after advancement to candidacy, or through year 8 in the program (whichever comes first). Extensions will be granted by the GA in consultation with the Chair only in exceptional circumstances and only on the basis of a petition signed by the student’s dissertation director. (This policy takes effect for students entering Fall 2011 or later, or given permission to proceed from the MA to the PhD as of Fall 2011 or later.)Every student is required to teach at least two semesters before receiving the Ph.D. A student who completes the M.A. requirements at U.C. Berkeley and is allowed to proceed into the Ph.D. program will normally teach for two semesters in the academic year following the post-M.A. review, subject to approval by the Committee on GSIships. (If such approval is denied the student may normally expect to teach for two semesters in the following academic year.) A student who enters the Ph.D. program with an M.A. or equivalent from another university will normally teach for two semesters either in the third year (if the student has a fellowship package covering both the first two years) or in the second year (if the student does not have two years of fellowship awarded on admission), subject to approval by the Committee on GSIships.Each student will have a Personal Advisor and will be subject to annual review. For details see the section “Advising and Reviews” (see 16 and 18 below).For students who are not yet advanced to candidacy, the Graduate Advisor (GA) is the main source of advising regarding academic matters. Students should expect to meet with the GA immediately upon arrival in the program and at least once per semester until advancement to candidacy to discuss choice of courses and planning for completing exams and other requirements. The GA has signature authority for forms and petitions related to graduate students and has the authority to decide (or share in deciding) which courses (including courses in other departments and graduate courses taken elsewhere) are to be counted for particular requirements.In addition to regular consultation with the Graduate Advisor, each student will have a Personal Advisor, that is, a member of the faculty to whom the student can turn for help and advice concerning the course of study, general reading, development of research interests etc. The student will meet with his/her PA at least once per semester.New students will be advised initially by the GA, but after the student has had the opportunity to become acquainted with members of the faculty (ideally by the beginning of the second semester in the program, and in any case by the end thereof), he/she will choose a more permanent PA in consultation with the GA.The GA may serve as PA. A student may change Advisor at any time (this may in any case be necessitated by faculty leaves or induced by the student’s advancement in the program or some change of interest).The PA will attend (in a non-voting capacity unless already a member of the relevant Committee) any formal review of the student by the M.A. Committee or the Ph.D. Committee. The PA may attend (in a non-voting capacity, unless already a member of the Committee) the student’s Oral Qualifying Examination. The PA will have some obligation to represent the student’s best interests and point of view at these meetings (though the extent and nature of advocacy on behalf of the advisee will naturally vary with the circumstances).17.1. Mid-year review: Early in the student’s second semester, the GA and the chair of the M.A. Committee will review each student’s grades and course evaluations submitted by instructors and will prepare a brief statement of evaluation to be communicated to the student in writing. The statement should indicate whether the student’s performance has been exceptionally good, fully adequate, or deficient; if deficient, specifics should be given and suggestions made for improvement.17.2. Third-semester review: The student’s progress in the first full year of study will be evaluated by the GA and the M.A. Committee not later than the seventh week of the student’s third semester. The review will again be based on grades and course evaluations and will include an interview with the reviewing committee and the GA; the Personal Advisor will attend the interview. Minutes of the review will be taken and, after being agreed upon by all those present at the meeting, kept as part of the permanent record in the student’s file.17.3. Review for advancement to the Ph.D.: Upon completion of all requirements for the M.A., the student is again reviewed: this review will normally take place near the end of the fourth semester. This review is conducted by a committee consisting of the M.A. Committee and the Graduate Advisor. (The Personal Advisor will normally attend this review, as a non-voting member unless already a member of the review committee.) The Committee will determine, on the basis of the student’s performance in the M.A. examinations and course work, and the written evaluations of instructors, whether or not the student should be admitted to the Ph.D. program. In cases of doubt the committee may specify the student’s deficiencies and set a timetable for rectification and further review. The decision of the review committee may be referred to a vote of the full department if (1) the student appeals the decision, or (2) there is a split vote in the committee, or (3) the committee is of the opinion that it needs the guidance of a full department meeting. The Committee may waive the interview with the student if all the following conditions have been met: (1) the student has already met with the Committee earlier in the same semester or in the immediately preceding semester; (2) the Committee at that time indicated that no problems were foreseen in the student’s progress through the program; (3) the student’s performance since that meeting has maintained the foreseen quality.17.4. Students who take more than four semesters to complete the M.A. continue to be subject to annual review by the M.A. Committee until the completion of the M.A and to a review for advancement to the Ph.D. at the completion of the M.A. exams and requirements. As stated in the M.A. regulations §3.1, failure to complete the M.A. by the end of the third year will be considered evidence of inadequate progress and is likely to lead to academic probation or denial of permission to proceed to the Ph.D.18.1. Prior to Advancement to Candidacy: Every Ph.D. student, both those advanced from the M.A. program and those admitted with an M.A. from another institution, will have a formal review meeting every year (generally every second semester) until Advancement to Candidacy with two members of the Ph.D. Committee (designated by the Ph.D. Committee Chair), for the purpose of discussing the student’s overall progress in the program and giving guidance on the student’s pursuit of his/her interests and long-term career; the student’s PA may also attend these reviews. Minutes of the reviews will be taken and, after being agreed upon by all those present at the meeting, kept as part of the permanent record in the student’s file.18.2. After Advancement to Candidacy: For students advanced to candidacy, the dissertation committee has the authority and responsibility to review the student’s progress and to advise him/her of its satisfaction. The committee may set reasonable deadlines for the student’s demonstrating adequate written progress in completing the dissertation: if deadlines are not met, the committee may instruct the GA to recommend to the Dean of the Graduate Division that the student’s candidacy be lapsed, which is a probationary status. A reasonable deadline in regard to jeopardy for being lapsed is a period of not less than one academic year. (Students in probationary status may not hold an academic appointment, nor receive a graduate fellowship, nor be eligible to receive an advanced degree.)The Graduate Council mandates annual review of the progress of students advanced to candidacy. A “Report on Progress” form is to be filled out by each student once per year (during Spring Semester), submitted to the dissertation chair, who will discuss the report with at least one other member of the dissertation committee and record their comments. If possible, the reporting members of the committee should meet in person with the student. The form is retained in the student’s file. In any case, if the dissertation is not completed within four years of advancement to candidacy, the student’s candidacy may be lapsed by the Dean of the Graduate Division (though in special circumstances the dissertation committee, through the GA, may recommend to the Dean continuance of a student whose candidacy has passed four years). A candidate whose candidacy has lapsed may be reinstated upon recommendation of the GA only if a complete draft of the dissertation has been submitted and judged by the committee to be acceptable with no more than minor revisions, and if the GA has advised the Dean that the qualifying examination and course work was not taken so long ago as to be invalid. Failure to achieve reinstatement of candidacy within a reasonable period of time after lapsing may result in the student’s candidacy for the degree being terminated or the student being dismissed from the program. Unless otherwise specified in the Graduate Division’s formal notice of lapsing, termination will normally take place at the end of the regular academic term in effect two years after the date of notification.For a full explanation of academic standing, see the Policies and Procedures section of the Graduate Division web site (Guide to Graduate Policy, section Course Work, Grading, Probation, and Dismissal; or more fully in Appendix A of the same Guide).In brief, a student is either in good standing or on some form of probation or subject to dismissal. Lapsing of candidacy and termination of candidacy are forms of probation. A student is subject to dismissal only if he or she has been given adequate written warning and a reasonable opportunity to correct any deficiencies. The written warning must include (a) the nature of the problem or deficiency; (b) steps that should be taken to correct the deficiency; (c) a reasonable period of time in which the student is expected to correct the problem or show improvement acceptable to program faculty; and (d) the approximate date at which the student’s record will next be reviewed.Students in probationary status may not be admitted to examinations (Masters’ comprehensive or Doctoral qualifying), nor be advanced to candidacy, nor hold an academic appointment, nor receive a graduate fellowship, nor be eligible to receive an advanced degree.The following examples of justifications for probation should be noted, as stated in the Policies and Procedures section of the Graduate Division web site (Guide to Graduate Policy, Appendix A, §9.B (this list is not exhaustive)):7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The Department of Classics strongly encourages applications from members of underrepresented groups (such as U.S. citizens or residents of African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American, or Native American descent) who are qualified to pursue graduate work in Classics.The Department nominates suitable candidates among its applicants for several fellowship programs aimed at increasing diversity. The Graduate Division sponsors special diversity events in March for those offered admissions who make campus visits as well as gatherings for enrolled students during the year. Outreach efforts are coordinated at the Divisional level as well within the College of Letters and Science, and the College also offers a roadmap for undergraduates preparing for graduate study—"Step by Step."7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Please see the 2011 revision.The Master of Arts degree in Classics, a Plan II degree (24 units and a comprehensive examination), is taken with either Greek or Latin emphasis. Students are expected to have completed before admission at least the equivalent of the undergraduate major in Classical Languages and are strongly urged to supplement these minimum requirements with two or three additional senior reading courses in Greek or Latin and with courses in Advanced Prose Composition. It is also recommended that students acquire an adequate reading knowledge of German and/or French or Italian before admission if possible.a. (4 units) either the Proseminar (Classics 200) or Approaches to Literature (Classics 203). Exemption from this requirement may be authorized by the Graduate Advisor (GA) only when a student has taken a course equivalent to either Classics 200 or Classics 203 elsewhere. If exemption is granted, then 4 additional units are required under 1b or 1c.b. (4 units) a seminar in the Classics Department, in a Greek subject for the Greek emphasis or in a Latin subject for the Latin emphasis.c. (4 units) an additional seminar in Classics or a closely-related field.d. 12 units in upper division courses in Greek, Latin, or closely-related fields or in graduate courses in Classics or in closely-related fields.NOTES: (1) "Graduate course" includes all courses numbered in the 200-series; "seminar" includes graduate courses other than those numbered 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 250, 260, 298, 299. Courses in the 300-series do not count as "graduate courses" or "seminars" for the purposes of these requirements. (2) Students planning to continue toward the Ph.D. should note that Classics 200 and Classics 203 are both required for that degree (see Ph.D. regulations 5j), and it is recommended that these courses be taken as early in one's graduate career as possible.EITHER for the Greek emphasis:a. Greek translation (2 passages of verse, each of 20-25 lines, and 2 passages of prose, each of 20-25 full lines): 3-hour exam.b. Greek literature: 3-hour exam.c. Greek history: 3-hour exam.OR for the Latin emphasis:a. Latin translation (2 passages of verse, each of 20-25 lines, and 2 passages of prose, each of 20-25 full lines): 3-hour exam.b. Latin literature: 3-hour exam.c. Roman history: 3-hour exam.NOTES:
	1. The comprehensive examination consists of the set of exams in translation, literature, and history. In the interest of rapid progress through the program, students may take individual exams as soon as they feel ready to do so. In the event that any of the exams are failed only the failed exams have to be retaken. At the beginning of the semester in which the student intends to complete the last of these exams (or equivalent coursework), the student must file an application for advancement to candidacy for the M.A. with the Graduate Division.2. Substitution of coursework: any student may satisfy the M.A. requirement in history by coursework substitution, namely by taking two seminars in Greek history (for the M.A. with Greek emphasis) or two seminars in Roman history (for the M.A. with Latin emphasis) given in the Classics Department or (with approval of the GA) the History Department, submitting research reports on historical topics, and earning a grade of at least A- in each. Where the emphasis of the seminar is ambiguous the course must be approved for substitution by the GA in consultation with the instructor. In satisfaction of these requirements one semester of History 105 (Ancient Greece) may be taken in place of one Greek history seminar and one semester of History 106 (Ancient Rome) may be taken in place of one Roman history seminar provided the approval of the GA is secured beforehand.1. by passing a take-home exam in prose composition in Greek (for the M.A.with Greek emphasis) or in Latin (for the M.A. with Latin emphasis), with a proficiency equivalent to the standard of the grade B (composition exams are administered by the Ph.D. committee), or2. by completing with at least a grade of B Classics 250 or 260 (250 for the M.A. with Greek emphasis, 260 for the M.A. with Latin emphasis).1-hour-fifteen-minute exam to test reading ability (a passage of 500 words with the use of a dictionary or of 300 words without a dictionary). This exam must be attempted by the end of the third semester in the M.A. program and if not passed at that time must be repeated in every subsequent semester until passed. (It is strongly recommended that students who enter the program without knowledge of any of the three languages attempt to achieve competency in German first.) See also Note 1 under §2(i) above.a. The M.A. requirements in coursework should normally be fulfilled by the end of the second year. The M.A. exams will normally be attempted at that time (or before) and must be attempted by the end of the third year.b. Reviews. Provisions for review of students at regular intervals during their M.A. program are described in the document "Evaluation of Progress of Classics Graduate Students."Each student will have a Personal Advisor, that is, a member of the faculty to whom the student can turn for help and advice concerning the course of study, general reading, development of research interests etc. The student will meet with his/her PA at the beginning and end of each semester and a note recording that these meetings have taken place will be appended to the student's file.New students will be advised initially by the GA, but immediately upon a student's entrance the GA will assign a temporary PA. After the student has had the opportunity to become acquainted with members of the faculty (ideally by the beginning of the second semester in the program, and in any case by the end thereof), he/she will choose a more permanent PA in consultation with the GA.The GA may serve as PA. A student may change Advisor at any time (this may in any case be necessitated by faculty leaves or induced by the student's advancement in the program or some change of interest).The PA will attend (in a non-voting capacity unless already a member of the Committee) any formal review of the student by the M.A. Committee. The PA will have some obligation to represent the student's best interests and point of view at these meetings (though the extent and nature of advocacy on behalf of the advisee will naturally vary with the circumstances).Admission to the M.A. program does not guarantee advancement to the Ph.D. program (see Ph.D. regulations 1b.). A student who earns an M.A. with Greek or Latin emphasis cannot be advanced to the Ph.D. program unless competence has been demonstrated in the non-emphasized language at least equivalent to that required to complete the undergraduate major in Classical Languages. The student has the right to demonstrate such competence by taking an exam (e.g. the M.A. translation exam in the non-emphasized language).7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Please consider enabling JavaScript in your browser's preference settings.Note: The requirements have been updated. Please see the 2011 revision.The program of studies which leads to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Classics at Berkeley is designed to give a thorough preparation in the fundamentals of classical scholarship while encouraging the pursuit of intellectual enquiry and the development of original research according to the capacity and interests of the individual student. The examination and course requirements which every student must satisfy before being advanced to candidacy to write a dissertation are intended to ensure attainment, up to at least the minimum level essential for a Classical scholar, of specific skills and all-round competence, both in the languages (ancient and modern) and the fundamental techniques of scholarship, and in the ability to sustain informed and penetrating discussion; the dissertation is intended to demonstrate the student's ability to make a successfully independent and original contribution to research.In addition the program has a practical professional aim. The holder of a Berkeley Ph.D. in Classics should be able to teach any lower division course in Greek or Latin, any upper division course in the language of special emphasis, and graduate courses in at least one area in the language of special emphasis and/or in an area common to both languages. This is the minimal aim, but all will be encouraged to go beyond it.1a. Students new to UC Berkeley who have an M.A. in Greek, Latin or Classics or equivalent preparation may be admitted to the Ph.D. program by the departmental admissions committee.1b. Students in the UC Berkeley M.A. program will be reviewed, upon completion of their M.A. examinations, by a committee consisting of the M.A. Committee and the Graduate Advisor. (The Personal Advisor will normally attend this review, as a non-voting member unless already a member of the review committee.) The Committee will determine, on the basis of the student's performance in the M.A. examinations and course-work, and the written evaluations of instructors, whether or not the student should be admitted to the Ph.D. program. The decision of the review committee may be referred to a vote of the full department if (1) the student appeals the decision, or (2) there is a split vote in the committee, or (3) the committee is of the opinion that it needs the guidance of a full department meeting. This review may be waived under certain circumstances (see below under "Classics: Advising and Review").Upon entry into the Ph.D. program each student shall discuss with the GA and/or PA how most appropriately to fulfill the breadth requirement (see 5f).Each student will have a Personal Advisor, that is a member of the faculty to whom the student can turn for help and advice concerning the course of study, general reading, development of research interests etc. The student will meet with his/her PA at the beginning and end of each semester and a note recording that these meetings have taken place will be appended to the student's file.Students new to Berkeley will be advised initially by the GA, but immediately upon a student's entrance the GA will assign a temporary PA. After the student has had the opportunity to become acquainted with members of the faculty (ideally by the beginning of the second semester in the program, and in any case by the end thereof), he/she will choose a more permanent PA in consultation with the GA.The GA himself/herself may serve as PA. A student may change Advisor at any time (this may in any case be necessitated by faculty leaves or induced by the student's advancement in the program or some change of interest).The PA will attend any formal review of the student by the Ph.D. Committee and may attend (in a non-voting capacity unless already a member of the Committee) the student's Oral Qualifying Examination. The PA will have some obligation to represent the student's best interests and point of view at these meetings (though the extent and nature of advocacy on behalf of the advisee will naturally vary with the circumstances).Every Ph.D. student will have a formal review meeting every year (generally every second semester) until Advancement to Candidacy with two members of the Ph.D. Committee (designated by the Ph.D. Committee Chair), for the purpose of discussing the student's overall progress in the program and giving guidance on the student's pursuit of his/her interests and long-term career; the student's PA may also attend these reviews. Minutes of the reviews will be taken and, after being agreed upon by all those present at the meeting, kept as part of the permanent record in the student's file.The progress of students advanced to candidacy will be reviewed every year (generally every second semester) by at least two members of the student's dissertation committee. A departmental record of the review will be maintained in the student's file, and the GA will report the essence of such reports annually to the Dean of Graduate Division.Comprehensive range5a. Students will be advanced to candidacy only after satisfying the requirements specified below in paragraphs 6 and 8 and after demonstrating that they have studied to a satisfactory level the full range of Classics language and subject disciplines through courses offered by the Department (or occasionally courses offered by allied departments). The doctoral degree program will ordinarily involve completion, with a satisfactory grade, of at least 64 units of course work between the beginning of the M.A. program and advancement to candidacy (for new students entering the program directly the GA, in consultation with the Department Chair, may grant credit for equivalent courses completed satisfactorily elsewhere).Graduate seminars[Most Classics seminars may be taken in one of two different ways:i) as "P" seminars, with the requirement of a final paper (or an equivalent workload, such as a final examination, as designated by the instructor) to be presented to the instructor and assessed as part of the final grade. P-seminars carry 4 units, with a regular letter grade.ii) as "X" seminars, requiring full participation in the course but no paper (or equivalent as described under i) above). X-seminars carry 2 units, and are normally taken for a S/U grade only, except that arrangement may be made with the instructor beforehand, at the instructor's discretion, for a letter grade to be given. Where the regulations below refer to "P-seminars, or the equivalent number of X-seminars" one P-seminar = two X-seminars.]5b. every student must complete satisfactorily at least 10 graduate level P-seminars, or the equivalent number of X-seminars, in Classics (or, occasionally, in an approved related field) in the 200 series (courses numbered 200, 250, 260, 298, 299 do not count for this purpose; the survey courses, Classics 201, 202, and 203 [but not any equivalent of 203] do count toward this total but not toward any of the following requirements; no more than 6 units of Classics 245 may be counted toward this requirement [subject to approval of both instructor and GA]) subject to the following further requirements:5c. at least 5 P-seminars must be completed with a grade of A- or higher.Language distribution5d. at least one P-seminar shall be completed satisfactorily in a Greek subject taken in the Classics Dept., and at least one P-seminar in a Latin subject taken in the Classics Dept.;5e. in addition to 5d at least 3 P-seminars, or the equivalent number of X-seminars, shall be completed satisfactorily in Greek subjects, and at least 3 P-seminars, or the equivalent number of X-seminars, shall be completed satisfactorily in Latin subjects; for the purposes of this requirement any one of 201A, 201B or 250 may be counted for Greek, and any one of 202A, 202B or 260 may be counted for Latin.Breadth Requirement5f. at least five P-seminars shall be completed satisfactorily in at least three of the following six fields: (1) archaeology/art history, (2) history, (3) linguistics, (4) literature, (5) papyrology/ epigraphy/ paleography, and (6) philosophy. Of these five P-seminars, at least two shall be completed satisfactorily in one of these fields.Proseminars5g. every student must complete satisfactorily Classics 200, the Proseminar, and Classics 203, Approaches to Literature. Exemption from either of these may be authorized by the GA only when a student has taken an equivalent course elsewhere; instead of Classics 203, a student may take an equivalent course in another department, but such equivalent shall not count toward the seminar requirement under 5b above. Classics 200 and Classics 203 will be offered in alternate years and students are encouraged to take each course the first time they have the opportunity (during the M.A. years, if applicable).Seminars per semester5h. at least 4 P-seminars must be taken in the first four semesters following entry to the Ph.D. program, and at least 1 X- or P- seminar each semester thereafter until Advancement to Candidacy is granted, except that a student who has fulfilled all unit and course requirements, but is not yet advanced to candidacy, may enroll instead in courses numbered 299 and 602.300, 601, 6025i. Units in 300-level courses and in 601 and 602 do not count toward residency or degree requirements; there is no limit on the total number of the 600 level units, but no more than 8 such units are allowed in any one semester.6a. A satisfactory level of competence must be demonstrated in all of the following:6b.(1) Greek language translation. The examination is in two parts.a) a 2-hour exam of unseen passages (intended to test "the ready scholar");b) a 3-hour exam of prescribed texts (intended to test "the prepared scholar"). The passages are taken from a selection of texts comprising the Common List (as drawn up and published by the Department from time to time: see Appendix)6c.(2) Latin Language Translation. The examination is in two parts.a) a 2-hour exam of unseen passages (intended to test "the ready scholar");b) a 3-hour exam of prescribed texts (intended to test "the prepared scholar"). The passages are taken from a selection of texts comprising the Common List (see Appendix)6d.The four parts total of these examinations are separable and may be attempted in any order or combination.6e.(3) Greek Prose Composition and Latin Prose Composition. Competence must be demonstrated in each language, either i) by passing the take-home exam set by the Ph.D. Committee, or ii) by completing the Advanced Prose Composition Course (250 or 260) with a grade of at least A-.[Note: continuing Berkeley students may already have satisfied this requirement in one language.]6f.(4) German and either French or Italian reading ability. 1-hour-fifteen-minute translation examinations are set in each language (a passage of 500 words for translation with the use of a dictionary, or 300 words without a dictionary).[Note 1: these examinations are set and judged by the M.A. Committee.Note 2: continuing Berkeley students will already have satisfied this requirement in at least one language.]6g. Time-table(i) All examinations are to be attempted not later than the fourth enrolled semester following admission to the Ph.D. program.(ii) Any examinations not passed by the end of the fourth enrolled semester following admission to the Ph.D. program must be retaken each subsequent semester. Failure to pass any of the required exams by the end of the sixth enrolled semester following admission to the Ph.D. program will normally result in a request to the Dean of Graduate Division that the student be placed on probation.(iii) New students entering the Ph.D. program directly must attempt the examination in their first modern language no later than the second enrolled semester in the Ph.D. program. If the exam is not passed on the first attempt it must be repeated in every subsequent enrolled semester until passed.(iv) The examination in the second modern foreign language must be attempted for the first time no later than the third enrolled semester in the Ph.D. program, and if not passed must be repeated in every subsequent enrolled semester until passed.(v) Notwithstanding 6g(ii), failure to complete the modern language requirement by the end of the fourth enrolled semester may result in termination from the program unless the examination committee votes to allow the candidate a subsequent attempt.6h. By the beginning of the second semester after completion of the M.A., students must have constructed an Individual Reading List in consultation either with their PA or other suitable faculty member. The List must total not less than 300 pages of Oxford Text (or equivalent). (1000 lines of verse is to be taken as the equivalent of 33 pages of prose.) For the sake of individual flexibility, however, no restriction is imposed on the number of authors covered, nor on the proportion of Greek to Latin. After approval by the GA, the List will form part of the student's file, and progress on completing it will be monitored by the GA and by the faculty member originally consulted. The List will be presented to the student's Oral Examination Committee when the committee is constituted. Changes to the list may be made up until that time. The list may be taken into account by the Committee in their conduct of the examination.7a. Every student is required to submit to the orals committee at least three papers in various fields of classical study demonstrating competence in methods of research, in the preparation of bibliographies, and in expository writing. One paper must be an exegetical commentary on a selected piece of Greek or Latin prose or poetry. One paper must be in the area of the proposed dissertation; or as an alternative to such a paper, the student may submit in its place a brief statement of interest concerning the probable area of dissertation research (3-10 pages in length, with an added bibliography of 2 or more pages).Papers are to be written in an acceptable scholarly form, with documentation provided in footnotes or endnotes; a consistent scholarly style, such as would be acceptable in a scholarly periodical or other publication, should be maintained (the standard of style of Classical Antiquity is recommended but not required). Seminar papers may be submitted in unchanged form if the name of the professor as well as his/her comments on the paper (in their entirety) are included.7b. Papers (including the alternative statement of interest) may be submitted to the GA at any time, but all three items must be in the student's file no later than two weeks after notification that the final written examination has been passed and the requisite courses and units completed.7c. The orals committee will review the items submitted and approve them before the oral examination takes place, and will notify the GA before the oral examination of any deficiencies found in them. If an item is judged not to be in suitable form, or not to be of sufficient quality, the committee may require it to be rewritten and resubmitted before proceeding with the oral examination.8a. The oral examination must take place as soon as possible after completion of all the written examinations and unit and course requirements: a student completing the requirements in the Fall Semester must take the oral no later than the 12th week of the following Spring Semester; a student completing the requirements in the Spring Semester must take the oral no later than the 5th week of the following Fall Semester.[Note: under no circumstances may the oral examination take place before (1) all written examinations (or course-work substitutions) under 6 above and all unit and course requirements under 5 above have been completed successfully and (2) the three items under 7 above have been submitted and approved by the orals committee.]8b. The orals committee. After consultation with the student, and taking cognizance of the distribution of the student's work as between the six fields listed in 5f and relative degree of concentration on Greek and Latin, the GA will recommend to the Graduate Division a committee of 4 members (3 of whom are members of the Classics Dept., one of whom is not) to conduct the oral exam. The committee will normally be selected within two weeks after notification that the final written examination has been passed and course and unit requirements met, and will be advised at once to review the items submitted by the student and to notify the GA as promptly as possible of any deficiencies found in them.8c. Emphasis and scope of examination. In accordance with Graduate Council policy, at least three distinct areas are to be covered in this examination. For the purposes of the oral examination, each of the six fields listed in 5f is divided into two parts, Greek and Roman (or Latin). Students choose to be examined either in two parts of one field and one of a different field, or in three parts of three different fields (e.g. Greek literature or Roman history or Greek archaeology or Latin linguistics), with the proviso that no candidate may focus for the entire exam on areas that involve only Greek texts or only Latin texts. Papyrology/ epigraphy/ paleography is divided for this purpose into four sub-sections, any two of which are held to constitute one part of the field: papyrology, Greek epigraphy, Roman epigraphy, paleography. Philosophy is divided for this purpose into four sub-sections, any two of which are held to constitute one part of the field: Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, post-Aristotelian philosophy. The student will also be examined in a special field connected to the probable area of his or her dissertation. This special field will usually be part of one of the broader fields just specified, and the designation of the special field is to be developed in consultation with the GA. The inclusion of the special field in the oral examination is intended to allow the student to demonstrate satisfactory plans and preparation in the proposed area of the dissertation topic. In their conduct of the examination, the examiners may also take into account the contents of the student's Individual Reading List.8d. Judging of the oral examination shall conform to the rules set forth by the Graduate Division.8e. Upon successful completion of this examination the student shall be eligible for award of the degree of Candidate in Philosophy (see 9b.).9a. Nature and scope. A dissertation is expected to be a full and original exposition of some aspect of classical study that has not previously been treated with the same fullness or from the same standpoint, and to demonstrate the ability to use the full range of methods and materials of classical scholarship in an enterprise of considerable, but limited, scope, largely on the student's own initiative.9b. Selection of topic and supervising committee. No later than the semester following that in which the oral qualifying examination is passed, the student must file with the Graduate Division an Application for Advancement to Candidacy for Doctor of Philosophy; the application must contain a statement of title of the proposed dissertation. A supervising committee will be appointed, consisting of three members, one of whom is a Berkeley Academic Senate member from a department other than Classics. The function of the committee is to guide the candidate in research and judge the merits of the dissertation. It is the policy of the Graduate Division that the chair of this supervising committee not be the same as the chair of the oral qualifying examination committee. Selection of the chair and the other two members of the dissertation committee is made by the GA in consultation with the student, but is subject to the approval of the Administrative Committee of the Graduate Council, which is formally responsible for the appointment of the dissertation committee.Following appointment of the supervising committee the student is required to confer with all three members before undertaking the work of a dissertation. The frequency with which the student confers with the three members of the committee is at the discretion of the student and the committee chair; however, members of the committee must be kept informed of the student's progress and must be consulted before any major changes of scope, direction or approach are made in the dissertation. Advanced candidates are reviewed annually (see §4 above).Should it become necessary, in the opinion of the GA and the student, to replace a member of the supervising committee (e.g. because the member has left the University, or because of irreconcilable disagreement among the committee members and the student about the direction which the dissertation should take), the GA, after consultation with all three members of the committee, will apply to the Graduate Division for reconstitution of the committee, suggesting a replacement member. If at any stage in the writing of the dissertation the student and the GA are unable to agree on the constitution of the committee, the student has the right to appeal to the Department chair, or finally to the Dean of the Graduate Division.9c. Satisfactory progress. Provisions for review of students advanced to candidacy and details about probation and lapsing of candidacy in cases of unsatisfactory progress are contained in the separate document "Evaluation of Progress of Classics Graduate Students".9d. Final approval. When the student, after consultation with the chair of the dissertation committee, considers that the dissertation has been completed satisfactorily, a final version shall be submitted to the committee for approval. Responsibility for placing the completed dissertation in the hands of the committee members rests with the student.If all three members of the committee approve the dissertation, they sign the official title page prepared by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate Division, where one copy is filed for later deposit in the University Library.For further information on the format of the dissertation and on filing procedures see the Graduate Division's "Instructions for preparing and submitting Theses and Dissertations for Higher Degrees".For the procedure to be followed in the rare event that the committee find, upon submission of a near final draft of the dissertation, that the work is not likely to be accepted without major alterations in either the research or the written presentation (i.e. more than minor revisions or editorial changes) see p.12 of the Graduate Division's document of November 1982 "Academic Progress Evaluation, Academic Standing and Appeals Procedures for Graduate Students".After the dissertation has been approved by the candidate's committee the original is filed with the Dean of the Graduate Division, on a date specified by that office. Along with the dissertation an abstract of it in duplicate, in no more than 350 words, with one copy signed by the dissertation committee chair, is filed with the Graduate Division.Normative Time, recommended by the Department and approved by the Graduate Council, which serves as the Graduate Division's basis for determining eligibility for Normative Time Fellowship, is as follows:Time to Qualifying Exam/Advancement to Candidacy: 10 semestersTime to complete dissertation: 4 semestersTotal: 14 semestersEvery student is required to teach at least two semesters before receiving the Ph.D. A student who completes the M.A. requirements at U.C. Berkeley and is allowed to proceed into the Ph.D. program will normally teach for two semesters in the academic year following the post-M.A. review, subject to approval by the Committee on GSIships. (If such approval is denied the student may normally expect to teach for two semesters in the following academic year.) A student who enters the Ph.D. program with an M.A. or equivalent from another university will normally teach for two semesters in the academic year following either (i) the passing of the Ph.D. Latin Translation examination or (ii) the passing of the Ph.D. Greek Translation examination plus completion of a minimum of two upper-division courses in Latin, with different instructors, at a grade of at least A- (whichever of (i) or (ii) occurs first), always subject to approval by the Committee on GSIships (if such approval is denied the student will normally expect to teach for two semesters in the following academic year).7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

It is administered by an interdepartmental committee whose members are:The program is designed to produce scholars with a broad range of expertise both in philosophy and classics, with the intention of bridging the gap between the two subjects. It provides the training and specialist knowledge required for undertaking research in ancient philosophy, and at the same time equips students for scholarly work and teaching in either classics or philosophy. Those who complete the program will be qualified to work as a full member of one of these disciplines, while having developed a broad competence in the other.Students apply for admission to either of the participating departments in accordance with their qualifications and interests. They are treated accordingly as graduate students fully in either the Department of Classics or the Department of Philosophy. The program offers graduate students of Classics the opportunity of taking classes in philosophy as an integral part of their work. It offers graduate students of philosophy the opportunity to develop their knowledge of both classical languages, and to make a thorough study of Graeco-Roman culture. Students from the two departments will meet each other regularly both in seminars on ancient philosophical texts and in reading groups and colloquia. Seminar offerings from the two departments are designed to give students, during their years in the program, the opportunity to study a wide variety of topics, including the Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, Hellenistic philosophy and the philosophy of later antiquity.Entrants to the program as Classics students, during their first two years, will fulfill the standard requirements of the Classics Department for the MA in Classics. They will be able at this time to take some philosophy courses in satisfying their requisite number of units. For the PhD their major field will be ancient philosophy. Like a PhD student of Classics who chooses philosophy as major field, they will take a broad range of seminars in ancient philosophy, but in addition they will take at least two courses in philosophy other than ancient philosophy, to be approved by the committee. Their seminars in ancient philosophy will include at least one course taught in the Philosophy Department. For information about entering the Joint Program as a graduate student in Philosophy, please see the program description on the Philosophy Department website.The Working Group in Ancient Philosophy, which is jointly sponsored by the Philosophy Department, the Classics Department, and the Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities, hosts a number of talks in ancient philosophy each year.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

They are now standard policy for Fall 2011 and beyond, unless further changed by the Department. These procedures apply to Classics MA and PhD exams; they do not apply to students in the Classical Archaeology program.1. All written exams, both MA and PhD, except the the Prose Composition exams (see 5 below), will be prescheduled to be given on the four weekdays preceding the first day of class of each semester, following a fixed order that will be modified only in unusual circumstances. Namely, modification of the standard template will be contemplated only when a candidate is also a first-time GSI and thus is obligated to attend the GSI training on a specific day. The standard template will not be modified to suit travel plans or personal preferences. In general, a student should make any travel plans to ensure being back in Berkeley the day before Day 1 on the schedule, since there may be times when an adjustment is needed.2. Signup for exams will have a deadline of May 1 for August exams and December 1 for January exams. The Graduate SAO will solicit signups with an initial email and with a reminder in April and November. Students will be reminded that if they will be teaching for the first time during the coming semester (and thus must attend GSI training), they should mention this fact when signing up for the exam.3. As soon as possible after May 1 or December 1 the Graduate SAO will inform the exam committee chairs which exams are needed, and the committees will draft and approve exams by the end of the semester in May or December.4. The standard schedule will be:5. Prose Composition Exams are take-home exams picked up at noon on Friday and due at noon on Monday and thus cannot be administered on a three-day weekend. They are therefore scheduled as follows: Fall: weekend following first week of classes: August 24-27, 2018 [NOTE: if first weekend turns out to be Labor Day Weekend, these exams will be delayed to the second weekend following the beginning of classes. Spring: weekend following first week of classes: January 19-21, 20186. Late signup: (1) if an exam has already been created, a student who has not signed up for that exam by the usual deadline may sign up late. The late signup must be submitted to the Graduate SAO no later than two days before the scheduled time of that exam. If an exam has not been scheduled because no one signed up by the deadline, that exam will not be available for late signup. Furthermore, a student who signs up late must be able to take the exam at the previously scheduled time and cannot request any modification to avoid a conflict. (2) Upon arrival, and after consultation with the Graduate Adviser, entering students may sign up late for one Modern Language in August (if they feel well qualified in two languages, they may take the second one in January). If the requested exam has not yet been prepared, the request must be made at least 7 calendar days before the scheduled time of the exam. If the requested exam has already been prepared, the late signup should occur no later than two days before the scheduled time of that exam.7. Withdrawal from exam after signing up: should circumstances not work out the way a student expects, a student may withdraw from the exam up to the day before the exam.8. Restrictions on simultaneous exams: (1) In normal circumstances it will not be possible to take two Modern Language exams in one term. (2) A student doing a Greek MA may not attempt any PhD Greek Translation exam until the semester after passing the Greek MA Translation exam. A student doing a Latin MA may not attempt any PhD Latin Translation exam until the semester after passing the Latin MA Translation exam.8. Unused exams: an exam that has been prepared and turns out not to be used will be retained securely by the Graduate SAO for use on the next relevant occasion.9. Changes of exam committee personnel: As the exam committees change from year to year (sometimes from semester to semester), they have the right to review exams composed and approved by a previous committee (retained unused exams, or regularly the August exams prepared the previous May) and to modify or replace them, but they are under no obligation to do so. Any such modification is to be completed one full week before the beginning of the exam schedule. It is recommended that the outgoing committee chair remind the incoming committee chair of this provision.10. Extraordinary third offering of exams: while the Modern Language exams will continue to offered for a third time toward the end of each Spring semester, other exams are offered only twice per year (as above) except in specific urgent situations related to timely advancement to candidacy for normative time or timely completion of the MA.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

If a problem cannot be resolved in such discussions, the GSI may make a written petition to the Department Chair for a grievance hearing. The instructor will be asked to provide a written response, and the matter will be referred to an ad hoc grievance committee named by the Chair (consisting of 1 Classics GSI, one Classics faculty member, and one faculty member from outside the Department).All GSI policies are to be posted in a convenient location in the Department; also, applications for GSIships and letters of appointment and assignment to courses are to contain a notice that these policies are posted, that they include a description of the applicable grievance procedure, and that a copy of the policy statements may be obtained from the Graduate Assistant.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

In recent years there have been 50-60 students in these majors, about two thirds of the them in Classical Civilizations and almost all the rest in Classical Languages.Prospective and current majors receive personalized advice both from Student Affairs Officer Cassandra Dunn and from the Undergraduate Major Advisors (faculty members who meet with each major at least once per semester). There is an active organization of undergraduates interested in Classics, serving non-majors as well as majors.The undergraduate teaching of the Department forms a major part of its mission, as is articulated in two components of the mission statement of the Department of Classics, which are repeated here:Prospective and current majors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the learning goals articulated for each major.The major in Classical Civilizations provides a highly flexible framework for study of many aspects of classical antiquity by itself and in comparison to other cultures, embracing work in the Department of Classics and in several other departments. Students picking this major may include several semesters of Latin or Greek in their program or they may take only courses that present material in English translation. (While this major may prepare a student for admission to graduate school in archaeology, history, or other fields, it does not provide enough language preparation for direct entry into most graduate programs in Classics centered on Greek and Latin language and literature.)See the requirements for the Classical Civilizations major. The major in Classical Languages provides a solid preparation in both ancient Greek and Latin and provides the prerequisites for application for graduate study in Classics at many universities.See the requirements for the Classical Languages major.These majors provide advanced preparation in either ancient Greek or in Latin. Students intending to apply for graduate study in Classics are advised to select the Major in Classical Languages, but these majors may be suitable preparation for other purposes (for instance, a major in Latin is excellent preparation for Medieval Studies).See the requirements for the majors in Greek or Latin.Majors with a high GPA in their Classics courses may elect to do Honors work in their final semester, including the writing of an Honors thesis.See the requirements for Honors work in Classics.Non-majors who do a significant number of courses in Classics, Greek, or Latin may qualify for a Minor.See the requirements for Minors in Classics.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Examples of such cultures would be: North, Central, or South Native American, Pacific, Chinese, Indic, sub-Saharan African, European bronze or iron age, and prehistoric; European medieval is also acceptable.This requirement may be met with courses in any department where relevant courses are offered; in particular, courses in Anthropology, Near Eastern Studies, History of Art, Linguistics, History, and Religious Studies might be appropriate, as well as Departments specializing in specific cultural areas.The faculty adviser will determine with the student what culture will be offered as an Area of Breath. Since many "topics" courses change subject from offering to offering, the student should consult closely with the faculty adviser.Two courses. All students must take Classics 130. A single 130 counts both in this category, Upper Division, AND in the five course, Upper Division requirement of the (1) the Art and Archeology and (2) the Classical History and Culture options above.Total units: 52 (lower division 16; upper division 28: additional lower or upper division 8; at least 26 must be in the Classics Department)Classical Civilizations majors with an overall University GPA of at least 3.6 and a GPA of at least 3.6 in the major are eligible. Honors requirements: (a) completion of the major program, (b) one semester of Classics H195. H195 consists of largely independent study, including the writing of a thesis, which is usually an outgrowth of work done previously in a senior-level course, which will be evaluated by an Honors Committee of three members. The student forms the Honors Committee, with one member as Chair. The written thesis is due on Monday of the 13th week of the semester. The Committee will agree upon the level of Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors), and the grade to be awarded no later than the Monday of examination week.Read a full description of Honors requirements.How to Declare a Major7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The requirements and procedures for Honors are as follows:A student must be a declared major in the Classics Department and in the subject in which Honors is done. A student must have a 3.6 overall GPA and a 3.6 GPA in the major courses.2. Course Work.Completion of the major program.For Honors in Classical Languages, Greek, or Latin, only:  Completion of at least one Senior Reading course in Greek or Latin poetry and one Senior Reading course in Greek or Latin prose; these can be done as part of the major program itself.Completion of the appropriate two-semester Honors course (Classics H195A-B, Greek H195A-B, or Latin H195A-B) with the grade of "C-" or better.  The first semester of the Honors course (the H195A segment) is worth 2-4 units, depending on the amount of work required by the Committee. The second semester of the Honors course (the H195B segment) is worth 4 units.Classics H195A-B: (a) Taken for Honors in Classical Civilizations:
	Prerequisites: Appropriate preparation and eligibility for admission to the honors program. The work for the Honors course may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Civilizations major or may be a newly conceived project.  The work will result in the writing of a thesis, to be evaluated by an Honors committee of three members.  Written thesis due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the course is taken.(b) Taken for Honors in Classical Languages:
	Prerequisites: Appropriate preparation and eligibility for admission to the honors program. The work for the Honors course may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Languages major or may be a newly conceived project.  The work will result in the writing of a thesis, to be evaluated by an Honors committee of three members.Written thesis due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the course is taken.Greek H195A-B:
	Prerequisites: Appropriate preparation and eligibility for admission to the honors program. The work for the Honors course may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Greek major or may be a newly conceived project.  The work will result in the writing of a thesis, to be evaluated by an Honors committee of three members.Written thesis due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the course is taken.Latin H195A-B:
	Prerequisites: Appropriate preparation and eligibility for admission to the honors program. The work for the Honors course may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Latin major or may be a newly conceived project.  The work will result in the writing of a thesis, to be evaluated by an Honors committee of three members.Written thesis due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the course is taken.To sign up for an H195A-B course the student must first form an Honors Committee and determine who the Chair of the Honors Committee will be (see next item). S/he must then fill out the Independent Study Form available from the Undergraduate Student Services Adviser. Upon submission of this Form, the student will be issued a Course Control Number which will allow official enrollment in the H195A-B course.The student doing Honors is responsible for organizing his/her Honors Committee. This is done by direct communication with professors the student would like to work with. The Honors Committee is composed of three Berkeley professors. At least two must have appointments in the Classics Department. Under exceptional circumstances, one professor may be from a Classics Department outside Berkeley (e.g., Stanford), but the other two must be from Berkeley's department.The student establishes that one of the three professors will be the Chair of the Committee. The Chair of the Honors Committee coordinates the student in his/her honors work, and is the Instructor of Record for the H195A-B course. The Honors Chair and the student consult the other members of the Honors Committee during the work on the thesis.The student submits a completed thesis by the Monday of the 13th week of instruction of the semester in which Honors is to be awarded. The Honors Committee, under the coordination of the Honors Committee Chair, reads and evaluates the thesis by the Friday of the 14th week of instruction.  The Committee determines by agreement what level of Honors the thesis will be given, if any. The levels are: cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude. Work graded B and lower will have a letter grade but will not be awarded Honors. The levels of Honors notionally correspond to the grades of "B+/A-" (cum laude), "A" (magna cum laude), and "A+" (summa cum laude).The Chair of the Honors Committee informs the student and the Chair of the Department of the level of Honors (if any) to be award. This must be done by the end of the 14th week of instruction.Award of Honors is announced at Commencement and a certificate is presented.Honors in the Department is entirely separate from Honors in General Scholarship, the parameters for which are based solely on overall GPA and are determined by the Registrar for each graduating class. An Honors Cord is worn at graduation to mark either Honors in General Scholarship, or Departmental Honors in the Major, or both. 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The process provoked helpful discussion among the faculty and thus a stronger sense of common purpose and shared standards in undergraduate teaching. The resulting statement also provides to Classics students a framework for understanding the intellectual coherence of their major program, the contribution that various individual courses make to it, and the skills and knowledge that they need to master to meet the expectations of a successful major program.The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Classics. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:The Department has four majors, and while most goals apply to all majors, two are expressed in slightly different terms for each major. KEY: CL = Classical Languages; G = Greek; L = Latin; CC = Classical Civilizations1.2.3. Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.4. Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.5. Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.6. Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.Below are visual representations of the paths through major requirements and the relation of different courses to the six goals listed above. Click on any image to see a larger version.The department is launching a pilot project for assessment in the 2009-10 academic year that will sample the achievement of graduating majors in the areas of critical thinking and (where appropriate) of language mastery. The assessment will have two components:(1) Language mastery. Each semester, one course from the series Greek 115-125 and one from the series Latin 115-122 will be designated in advance to provide a sampling for language translation. The instructor includes a sight translation on the final exam (or, in rare cases, provides a comparably diagnostic translation passage on the final or tests the class separately near the end of the semester with such a passage). When the exams have been corrected, the instructor records the results of that passage on a separate sheet, showing only SID and a grade expressed as x points earned/maximum points available, and this sheet will be submitted to the Department Chair, who will preserve a copy and provide another copy to the person(s) designated to analyze the information.(2) Critical thinking. The sample is student-initiated. Majors in their senior year are informed that they are required to designate for separate assessment one of the papers they are writing in a Classics course in their senior year. (Students may regard this as a kind of capstone to their major. Students writing an honors thesis will normally designate the thesis.) The professor records the student's grade for the paper anonymously, keyed only to the student's SID number, and in addition evaluates the student's performance along a set of criteria as set out in the following table. Each criterion is awarded a maximum of 6 points, for a maximum total of 36 points. The results are transmitted to the Department Chair, who will preserve a copy and provide another copy to the person(s) designated to analyze the information.(Download PDF version of table.) 7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Here are some general points of information that may answer questions you have. If you would like further information, please contact an Undergraduate Adviser.Use the navigation links under Programs above, selecting Undergraduate.We do not have a placement exam in ancient languages. In general, two years of high school Latin is equivalent to one semester of Berkeley Latin. So if you have two years' Latin, you should enroll in Latin 2 (second semester Beginning Latin); if you have four or more years, you should enroll in Latin 100 (Republican Prose).Berkeley, like other UC campuses, can admit only a limited number of its students from out-of-state (including foreign), but the number of non-resident admissions has been rising. Thus, as a non-resident you may be competing against a very elite pool for a few slots. But you should apply anyway! You should also know that the cost of attending Berkeley for a non-resident is approximately the same as, or less than, for attending a private university.The admissions process is run entirely from the Office of Admissions and Records. The departments are not consulted, nor can a letter from a department enhance chances for admission. Regrettably, therefore, we cannot aid you in your application for admission to Berkeley, even though you wish to major in Classics.Yes, if you will be a junior or senior. See the requirements for admission to Summer Sessions as a high school student at http://summer.berkeley.edu/. For offerings, go to that same address, or check our departmental course page.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Please consider enabling JavaScript in your browser's preference settings.The three Centers affiliated with the Department are often in need of Graduate Student Researchers during the academic year and during the summer. A few of these positions are half-time, providing full support, and others are at 25% time, enough to qualify the student for payment of fees by the research fund. In addition, Classics faculty often hire students to assist in their research work. Such jobs are generally arranged on an individual basis by the faculty member. If you wish to inquire about currently available positions, please leave your name and c.v. with the Student Affairs Officer.The Department hires Graduate Student Instructors to fill about 32 positions per year (about 16 per semester). The application process takes place each spring, with a deadline in the second half of March. Most of the positions go to graduate students in Classics and AHMA and Comparative Literature, but applications are entertained from qualified students in other departments. For more information, please refer to the GSI policies and procedures document.Applications are invited each fall for the positions of Director of the Greek Workshop, Director of the Latin Workshop, and instructor of several other courses that may be offered in the summer session of the following year. Applications are invited each February for the positions of assisting GSIs in the summer workshops (3 GSIs in each workshop). For more information, please refer to the GSI policies and procedures document.Students who have just filed their dissertations are eligible to be hired as Lecturers. Lecturers are sometimes hired for summer session positions such as instructor of Latin 100 or Classics 28 and occasionally for academic-year teaching to replace faculty on leave. Qualified candidates should inform the Chair of their availability and interest by written letter.The Department employs a few readers and projectionists each semester as hourly employees. Both undergraduates and graduate students may apply, but graduate students will usually be given preference for the position of Reader. Readers may be required in lower-divsion lecture courses such as Classics 10A, 10B, 28, 34, 35, 36 and rarely in upper-division courses. A poster inviting applications is distributed the week before classes begin each semester, and the deadline for application is 4 pm on the Friday of the first week of classes. The letter of application should be submitted to the chair and should contain the course(s) applied for, a description of the candidate's qualifications for the job, hours of availability, and contact information.Projectionists are sometimes needed in courses such as Classics 17A, 17B, Classics 170, and Classics 175. The application process is the same as for Readers.The Department sometimes funds an hourly employee who helps with reshelving of slides used in Classics courses. This work averages about 3 hours per week and the schedule is very flexible. The student works in Visual Resources Collection, 308A Library, under the supervision of its staff. Both undergraduates and graduate students may apply. The application process is the same as for Readers, but hiring usually takes place only in Fall Semester to cover the whole year.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

None of these will supply total support, so you should plan to use your own resources. In general, you should seek funding from afar first and then move closer to home if that is not available.FIRST, if you are accepted to participate in a conference, determine whether the conference organizers are going to pay any of your expenses, and get their commitment in writing.SECOND, the APA has recently begun giving some subsidy to graduate students who have a paper on the program. If you have a paper accepted, you should also apply for such funds, if they are available.THIRD, the Graduate Division provides modest support for students advanced to candidacy who are on the job market or near being on the job market. The application requires lead time and should be attended to promptly once you know you have had a paper accepted.FOURTH, if the conference or your topic is related to epigraphy or papyrology, then you should apply to the Director of the Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy or the Director of the Center for the Tebtunis Papyri, since those Centers support graduate student research and travel in those areas.FIFTH, the Heller Committee awards grants for travel to conferences. There is a separate policy statement that gives the general rules and priorities.SIXTH, and last resort, the Chair of Classics has a certain amount of discretionary funds and will entertain applications (from Classics students only) for travel support from those who have exhausted, are ineligible for, or failed to receive all of the above. The Chair may also appeal to chair-holders for student support whenever appropriate. To request this funding, direct a letter to the Chair including: (a) name, venue and date of conference; (b) title of the paper you will deliver and copy of letter of acceptance or program listing it; (c) amount requested (this normally will not exceed a cheap roundtrip airfare); (d) explanation why it has been impossible to obtain funding from other sources.Revised December 5, 2006.7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

Please consider enabling JavaScript in your browser's preference settings.Revision Approved March 1998The following list of uses to which the Heller Fund is put is given in order of priority, reflecting the department’s policy of dedicating most of the expenditure of the fund to the support of graduate students. (This policy derives from the original connection of the fund with the Nemea project, which is itself tied to the support of graduate students).[1] $17,000 is appropriated annually by the head graduate adviser to supplement Block Grant fellowship funds to provide graduate student fellowships and/or non-resident tuition. (This use of the fund replaces the Heller graduate student fellowship.)[2] Graduate student subsidy for conference-related travel: for policies see below.[3] Graduate student subsidy for summer travel to classical lands and/ or to pursue study projects abroad. For policies see below.[4] Full coverage of costs for an annual Heller lecturer (chosen by the graduate students) or a contribution to the costs of an occasional Heller colloquium (organized by the graduate students).[5] A contribution may also be made from the fund towards the costs of colloquia or conferences organized on campus by faculty of the department.[6] In general, in considering expenditures other than the first five listed the committee should consult the department.NOTE 1: The Heller committee is officially the Committee on the Heller Fund and Other Restricted Funds. The latter part of the name refers at this time only to the J. K. Anderson Award Fund. Each year the committee reviews the applications and recommends an awardee for the annual J.K. Anderson undergraduate travel award to the department chair. (The award does not derive from the Heller fund, however, and it is the department chair who is responsible for inviting applications.)NOTE 2: A single consolidated folder of Heller materials is kept and passed on by the chair of the Heller committee, containing (a) past policy documents and memos, and (b) documentation of the awards made in the current year, with explanation of cases in which the decision was not automatic. A copy of this folder is kept by the MSO. The spreadsheet for the fund is maintained by the department’s financial assistant.[TOP]Revised December 2006Please see also the separate document on sources of subventions for graduate students for conferences.(1) Placement-related travel to the APA/AIA (or to any other) convention within the continental United States will be automatically subsidized once in a student's career, at 100% of airfare if funds are available, and regardless of whether the student is giving a paper at the convention. (However, students eligible to apply for subsidy for this purpose from Graduate Division are strongly urged to do so; see details in section [3]). Students may apply for placement-related travel subsidy more than once, but subsequent awards are not automatically granted.(2) Students may also apply for subsidy for non-placement related travel (i) to the APA/AIA convention (e.g. to give a paper, or to gain experience) or (ii) to conferences other than the APA/AIA convention. In the latter case the student should normally be a formal participant in the conference, whether by giving or commenting on a paper, or participating in a panel. Students may apply for subsidy for the types of travel listed in this section more than once, but priority is given to first-time applicants. Unlike awards for first-time placement-related travel, awards for the types of travel listed in this section are not automatically granted. (Again, students eligible to apply for subsidy for these purposes from Graduate Division are urged to do so; see details in section [3].)(3) Students who are "in the final stages of their graduate work" (i.e. advanced to candidacy and working on their dissertations), who are presenting a paper at a professional conference on the topic of their dissertation research, and who are registered Ph.D. students (not on filing fee) in good academic standing, can apply to Graduate Division for travel subsidy. A letter of support from the Graduate Adviser (not the chair of the Heller Cttee) is required. Application must be made at least three weeks before date of travel; earlier application is strongly recommended. No student may apply for such a grant more than once. If a student is eligible for such a grant, application should be made both to Graduate Division and to the Heller Fund, so that the Heller Fund can step in (under the guidelines in sections [1] and [2]) should funding from Graduate Division not be forthcoming. The Heller Fund may provide a supplement to a Graduate Division award if the latter is insufficient to cover airfare. Such a supplement will not count as the student's one-time placement-related award.(4) Heller fund grants will be given to reimburse long-distance travel only (either airfare or other long-distance travel). They may not normally be used to cover short-distance travel (van, limousine, taxi etc.), lodging, or meal expenses. Travel will be reimbursed up to a maximum that varies annually, or actual fare, whichever is less.(5) Grants in excess of the maximum may be given to students who must travel to more than one convention in any one year in order to make themselves available for job interviews. [Policy approved December 1999.](6) Application for a Heller fund grant should be made by writing to the chair of the Heller committee as early as possible in the fall semester of the year in which you plan to attend the convention. Include relevant details of your long-distance travel plans, and mention whether you have applied for a grant from Graduate Division.Link for application form.[TOP](1) Students in graduate programs in Classics or Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeology with an emphasis on Classical studies may apply for a grant from the Heller Fund to help cover the costs of overseas travel in the summer.(2) The purpose of summer travel shall be to pursue an academically justified and practical program of self-enrichment and education either through the travel itself, or through a study project, or both.(3) The Heller Grant is intended to help graduate students travel for enrichment, study in academic institutions, participate in excavations or other field work, pursue individual research projects, etc.; but not to cover the full cost of such projects. Since the Department offers only supplemental assistance, applicants are urged to seek financial aid from other sources, such as the Graduate Division, foundations, etc.(4) Students in Classics shall receive priority consideration over students in AHMA.(5) Students who have not traveled to Classical Lands and/or pursued study projects abroad shall receive priority consideration over students who have done such travel and/or study.(6) The amount of each grant will depend on the funds available from Heller resources, and on the number of grants awarded.(7) To apply, fill out the form distributed annually by the Heller Committee in late March, along with a single page containing (a) a description of your overall plan for travel, including a fairly detailed itinerary if enrichment travel is included, (b) an explanation what role that travel will play in your education as a graduate student, and (c) an estimate of your travel costs.(8) Heller grant recipients are required to submit a brief report describing the project and giving an account of how the funds were used, within three months of the end of the travel or project.Link for application form.[TOP]The Corinne S. Crawford Memorial Graduate Student Support Fund is an endowment established by the family and friends of Corinne Crawford, a graduate student who died in 2007.The terms of the endowment provide that the payout shall be used to provide financial support to graduate students in the Department. of Classics at UC Berkeley. Recipients will be selected by the Chair of the Department of Classics (or his/her designee). Among Graduate applicants , preference will be given to those pursuing a specialization in Roman Studies. The two preferred uses of the award will be for travel to Roman lands for research and study and /or for final dissertation year support. [TOP]7233 Dwinelle Hall #2520, University of California ~ Berkeley, CA 94720-2520 ~ 510-642-4218 (Phone) ~ 510-643-2959 (Fax)© 2017 UC RegentsHome About Programs People Courses Resources Contact

The deadline is in April of each year, and papers from courses taken in the previous summer or fall or the current spring are eligible. For additional information, eligibility guidelines, and application procedures, see http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/researchprize.An announcement is circulated in early spring to undergraduate majors. To apply for funding, students submit a letter of application and a budget to both Classics Undergraduate Faculty Advisors, sheltonk [at] berkeley [dot] edu (Professor Shelton) and Professor Papazarkadas via email. The letter should explain the applicant's background in, connection to, or study of Classics and describe the proposed study, travel, excavation, etc. Students who have submitted a letter of application and a budget will be considered for all available grants and funding. An announcement of the opening of application process will be send to the Classics Undergraduate listserv. Letters of application are generally due the first week of April. There is no special application form.An award of at least $1500 to support an undergraduate in summer study and/or travel in classical lands, with preference given to undergraduate students of Classics and to attendance at summer programs offered by the American School of Classical Studies: Summer Session and the American Academy in Rome: Summer Program in Archaeology. The term "students of Classics" is meant to include not only declared majors, but also students of Greek, Latin, or Classics who have not (or not yet) declared a major in one of those fields.An award to support summer study in Greece for an undergraduate student enrolled in the Department of Classics in the College of Letters and Science.The Grant supports one student in pursuing some aspect of Classics while abroad during the summer. This could be travel, study, excavation, or a combination of these activities. The award is restricted to declared majors in the Department. One award of $1500 is made each year.American Academy in Rome: Summer Program in ArchaeologyAmerican School of Classical Studies: Summer SessionThe Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology and the Department of Classics now sponsor two archaeological field school programs through UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, one in Nemea and one in Mycenae, both led by Nemea Center Director Kim Shelton. For more information click here.There is an on-line listing at http://www.archaeological.org/ (click on the fieldwork link)Berkeley participates fully in the UC Education Abroad Program. There is no UC Education Abroad Program in Athens. There is one in Rome. Full details can be found at the UC Center Rome website. While there are also centers in other locations in Italy, none is particularly suited for study of classics and classical civilization, although all would have courses appropriate to the majors. We have also had a steady trickle of students studying at EAP centers in the United Kingdom and Ireland. For the EAP website specific to Berkeley's programs, see UC Berkeley Study Abroad Program.There are three non-EAP programs, two in Athens and one in Rome:Planning. Applications for these programs are due in late October of each year for study in the following academic year. Planning therefore needs to begin in the Spring semester before you plan to apply, and so a year before you plan to go abroad.Costs. The UC Education Abroad Program plans its centers so that a Berkeley student can study abroad for about the same cost (tuition, fees, housing) that it would cost to remain at Berkeley. This estimate does not, of course, include additional expenses such as travel to and from the center, and other travel while abroad.On the other hand, study in any other program can cost more than study in Berkeley. For example, the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, the premier study abroad opportunity for classics students, costs about twice what it costs to attend Berkeley, because it is a consortium based upon private colleges and universities, with the higher tuition costs that entails. But not all private programs are so expensive. For example, the College Year in Athens, because of the lower cost-of-living in Greece, actually costs the same or less than a semester at Berkeley.Classics Study Abroad Scholarship (CSAS). The Department has two grant programs available each year to help with the cost of study abroad.
	1. Study in an EAP center. A grant is available to provide $1500 for travel in classical lands while abroad (if the center is near those lands).
	2. Study in a non-EAP center. Such a center must be in a classical land (usually, but not necessarily, restricted to Italy and Greece). A grant is available to pay for the difference between tuition and housing of the nearest equivalent EAP center, if the private center costs more.
