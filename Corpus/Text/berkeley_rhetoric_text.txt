  TuTh 930-11A, 50 BIRGE4 UnitsThis course introduces Rhetoric majors to legal, political, and cultural discourses of the logo, defined as a word/image that is owned, used and misused through symbolic production, consumption, and appropriation. Readings and lectures will examine the historical emergence of the logo as legalized property and as commodity sign, and will survey the trademarks, brands, designs, signatures, characters, and other signifying devices through which capitalist culture communicates origin, responsibility, trust, ownership, taste, fashion, and status. We will also examine thefts, appropriation, and infringements of the mark in numerous cultural and political contexts, broadly encompassing literary, artistic, and performative traditions. Creative and research assignments will train students in various practices of interpretation, including cataloguing, classification, transcription, description, narrative, visualization, criticism, design, and performance. Students will be required to present their work in weekly discussion sections.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  TuTh 1230-2P, 2 LECONTE4 UnitsThis course will cover the discursive History of Europe’s relations with its “Others” from the period of the Middle Ages to the early twentieth century. We will study saints, sinners, Jews, Protestants, witches, lepers, slaves, Aztecs, explorers, factory workers, vampires and monsters. We will examine religious beliefs and religious wars, the most horrific sorts of torture, the Black Death, the "discovery" of new worlds, the trade in slaves and the making (and breaking) of kings, nations and empires. Though the history of the period spanning the Middle Ages to the present is traditionally viewed as a triumphal march of progress from superstition to Enlightenment, we will see how this "progress" was made possible by the persecution of peoples and cultures considered marginal and/or different. The “rhetoric of alterity”—How “Others” were historically defined, represented and used as a means of constituting Western identities (e.g., in terms of race, class, citizenship, and nation-state)—will form the course’s central theme; we will also be concerned with understanding how oppressed and marginalized groups resisted impositions of dominant groups and articulated their own narratives—their own rhetoric—of “otherness”. © UC Regents 2014.

  TuTh 330-5P, 88 DWINELLE4 UnitsIn a world where visibility—being seen and seeing—constituted the ground upon which identities were constructed and fashioned, performance (dress, manners and speech) came to play a preeminent role in arbitrating power and authority.  The questions that will concern us in this class grow out of early modern attempts to articulate, maintain and transgress distinctions between publicly performed persona and private persons, between “exterior masks” and “interior selves.” Where did one leave off and the other begin?  What was a mask, and what was really true?  Where did art stop and nature begin?  And what happened to virtue—to authenticity—in a world where “appearances” seemed to mean everything and where “reality” remained hidden behind closed doors and affected masks? And what was the price of such outward conformity—frustration? cynicism? madness?  Not only will we pay attention to the ways people tried to put on appearances as a means of achieving social success, but to the psychological consequences of “playing a part.”  Similarly, we will also examine the ways in which role-playing; dissimulation and disguise were all potent means of inflecting, challenging and rebelling against accepted social norms of behavior. © UC Regents 2014.

  TuTh 5-630P, 205 DWINELLE4 UnitsWhat are the affective and neurological effects of listening to music?  Is there any art to listening to musical sounds?  What kind of art practice is music?  Modern philosophies of music have posed such questions, attempting to identify the unique and exceptional power of music in order to distinguish it from other arts such as drama, literature, painting or sculpture. Certain philosophers have claimed, in fact, that music is the highest of all arts—aesthetically, psychologically, and epistemologically—because of its abstract purity, its universality, and its singular capacity to express, represent and incite emotions.  This course explores such issues in 19th-21st century philosophy.We begin with introductory readings in the field and discipline of the philosophy of music.  We then read—among other philosophers, novelists, critics and musicologists—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche Adorno and Barthes’ philosophical writings on music.  Finally, we will have the occasion to listen to specific musicians, both popular and classical, and to explore the contexts of their work, concentrating on the historical and political dimensions of the practice, performance and art of making music.Students’ active participation in the course is essential to both the course’s success and their grades.  The course will include not only written work, oral group participations but also weekly blog postings combining image, music and words.Class Prerequisites:  RH10 and RH20.Final class list will be determined at the end of the second week of classes.   © UC Regents 2014.

  MW 4-530P, 182 DWINELLE4 UnitsAnalysis of rhetorical practice in the context of social and cultural change with particular reference to the historical transition from pre-industrial to industrial society in the west. 
(Course description from on-line Berkeley Academic Guide)What is “rhetorical practice”? What is “society”? And “culture”? And how the heck do they change? In this class you will probably end up with as many unanswered questions as answered ones. We will focus on the exoneration of Chicago women who killed their husbands during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a practice involving legal rhetoric which indeed changed. Such change ostensibly corresponds to a “transition” from “unwritten” to “written” law. How does one articulate such history, given that both law and history rely on writings as evidence and as sources of authority?Students will be required to deal with a range of texts - from newspaper articles and images to legal documents and scholarly secondary sources, from poetry to on-line websites to the musical film “Chicago.” Many short assignments and two longer papers will be assigned. The emphasis of the course will be on learning to do research so as to ask better questions.REQUIRED TEXTS:
Jeffrey S. Adler, First in Violence, Deepest in Dirt: Homicide in Chicago 1875-1920 (Harvard U Press, 2006) 
Clay Conrad, Jury Nullification: The Evolution of a Doctrine (Carolina Academic Press)

  TuTh 5-630P, 242 DWINELLE4 Units“Examination of philosophical dialogues from Plato to Heidegger. Focus on the interaction within the dialogue, the participation required of the reader/listener, and the relation of such interaction and participation to thinking, speaking and knowing.”In this twice-weekly seminar, we will read and discuss dialogical works by great philosophers concerned with language and knowledge. Through close readings of quite difficult texts and hokey in-class exercises and exchanges, we will consider what makes a dialogue something other than a monologue or a monograph, what sorts of interactions and participations occur in dialogue, and how these sorts of interactions and participations relate - and may have related differently in different times - to reading, writing, speaking, thinking and knowing. The substantive focus of the dialogues this semester is on what (and how) humans take the world to be.Enrollment: attendance is required. Students who attend but are not enrolled will be given precedence over students who enroll but do not attend for the first two weeks.REQUIRED TEXTS will include the following, as well as some supplementary readings:Plato, Euthyphro (any edition with line #’s indicated)Plato, Timaeus and Critias (Johansen, ed; Lee, trans) Penguin 
(Loeb edition also ok)Murdoch, Acastos (Penguin)Galileo, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Modern Library)Heidegger, Conversations along a Country Path (Davis, trans) Indiana U PressREQUIREMENTS:
Because this is a seminar, on dialogue, it is very important that you attend class, having prepared in advance, and that you participate each week. Please bring a copy of the relevant reading for each class and some paper that you can write on to hand in any in-class assignments. You should save these and other returned assignments and hand everything in as a (hard-copy) packet along with your final exam to the instructor’s mailbox in the Rhetoric Department by 10:00 am on the day of the final exam.In-class assignments will vary: some will be oral, some written, some individual, some group. They are designed to have you think substantively about the reading, engage in various practices relating to the readings, and prepare for the longer written assignments.There will be 3 longer written assignments, one following each of the three units (on Plato; on the vast middle period represented by Galileo; and on the moderns). Several writing options will be offered as the final exam, which will involve presentations and take-home writing.The SYLLABUS will be distributed on the first day and is subject to amendment, depending on the needs and pacing of the class.  © UC Regents 2014.

  TuTh 930-11A, 215 DWINELLE4 UnitsThe dominant geographical focus of postcolonial literary and cultural studies has been on the literature of British Africa, India, the Caribbean, and their various diasporas in the North Atlantic.  The historical variety of colonial regimes, however, makes it more appropriate to speak of colonialisms in the plural and different experiences of anti-colonial nationalism and postcoloniality.  This course examines the relationship between the novel as a literary form and the imagining of national community through a comparative study of narrative fiction from decolonizing and postcolonial Southeast Asia, South Asia and Africa.  We will read novels by Jose Rizal (the Spanish Philippines), Pramoedya Ananta Toer (Indonesia), Ayi Kwei Armah (Ghana), Salman Rushdie (Ukania/South Asia), and Ninotchka Rosca (postcolonial Philippines) and critical writings by theorists such as Gyorgy Lukacs, Walter Benjamin, Franco Moretti and Benedict Anderson in order to explore questions such as the following: what are the consequences of the encounter of native populations with the ideas, cultural forms and sociological structures of modernity as a result of colonialism, and how are these phenomena used to subjugate native populations?  How can we explain the rise of the radical “educated native” who plays a pioneering role in opposing the colonial regime despite the fact that the educated native derives many benefits under colonialism?  What role can radical nationalist literature play in the continuing process of political revolution both before and after formal independence?  We will also consider the use of the Bildungsroman, magical realism and the tropes of heterosexual romance and reproduction in the representation of the postcolonial nation.

  W 2-5P, 109 DWINELLE4 UnitsAs a common form of interacting, documenting and informing, the interview plays a central role in the process of social and cultural inquiry. The interviewer often engages in dialogues with selected witnesses to seek information for an argument or to carry forward a course of reasoning. In the processes of researching, negotiating, inscribing and showing, interaction with the subjects of inquiry often revolves around postures of objectivity and of neutrality. The interview is here not only studied in its popularized use as a form of oral witnessing and of privileged access to personalities. It is also explored in its critical and potentially creative dimensions as part of a mise en scène or a setting in which interviewer and interviewees function as social actors. Here, information and truth provide the structuring presence through which questions of power and subject, or of testimony, authentication and legitimization are raised. Focusing on the framing process while engaging in critical debates on politics and aesthetics, the seminar will revisit the structures of the documentary interview (with a range of film & video examples) and explore the site where inter-viewing becomes a performative art, playing with the structure of interview and the very space of betweenness.

    Eileen Jones, 
  F 10-1P, 142 DWINELLE4 UnitsBecause of the vividness of her characters and storylines, which can be readily abstracted from her novels and molded to fit the romantic comedy genre, Jane Austen’s six completed novels have been repeatedly adapted for British, American, and Indian film and television. They have been updated to contemporary times (Bridget Jones’ Diary, Clueless), adapted cross-culturally (From Prada to Nada, Aisha, Bride and Prejudice) and made to reflect particular religious views (Pride and Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy). Even a film biography of Jane Austen has been made to conform to formulaic aspects of popular romance cinema (Becoming Jane). Less likely to be included in film and television adaptations of Austen’s work is her often scathing social criticism, her mordant view of gender, familial, and community relations entangled in economic necessities, and in general her authorial “voice,” which is distinctive in its irony and tone of cool judgment. Though a narrating authorial male voice has often accompanied the adapted works of Charles Dickens, for example, there is no comparable narrating authorial female voice, at the beginning of the umpteenth film version of Pride and Prejudice, to inform us, “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”In this course we will consider the strategies of various filmmakers to translate Jane Austen’s narratives to a new medium, as well as their attempts to convey or obscure Austen’s distinctive “voice” in film adaptations of Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma. We will also examine how our interpretations of Austen’s novels have been influenced by these film adaptations.Because the four Austen novels constitute a great deal of reading, we’ll be focusing on the analysis of primary texts and film adaptations. Throughout the course, I’ll be referring to many secondary texts dealing with Jane Austen adaptations, including Jane Austen in Hollywood, edited by Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield, The Cinematic Jane Austen, edited by David Monaghan, Ariane Hudelet, and John Wiltshire, Jane Austen On Screen, edited by Gina Macdonald and Andrew F. Macdonald, Moving Between Literature and Cinema: Adaptations and Appropriations of Major Jane Austen Novels by Fatemeh Gholipour Fereydouni, and Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice by Deborah Cartmell.Attendance is required.  © UC Regents 2014.

    Eileen Jones, 
  MW 930-11A, 142 DWINELLE4 UnitsIn this course we will examine the hybridization of two American genres, the Western and film noir. We'll examine how the combined traits of the two genres complicate the social conflicts they depict and defamiliarize their defining locales and geographies. In film noir the space is urban, labyrinthine, and entrapping, and in the Western it is rural, vast, and open. The classic Western hero represents assured traditional masculinity, whereas the troubled anti-hero of film noir is the embodiment of post-World War II masculinity in crisis. The tension created by representing opposed elements in combination (heroic anti-heroes, open yet entrapping spaces) defines the early action films of the 1970s, such as the Dirty Harry films starring Clint Eastwood, and the Spaghetti Westerns directed by Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) that made him a major star.We’ll study recent examples of the Western noir hybrid including the Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men,  Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man, the 2007 remake of 3:10 to Yuma, and the acclaimed television series Justified and Deadwood. We’ll also trace the antecedents of this genre hybrid back to the late 1940s - '50s, when dark Westerns emphasizing psychopathology and existential entrapment were produced in great numbers (Pursued, Blood on the Moon, The Furies, The Gunfighter, Yellow Sky), along with film noirs set in contemporary rural Western areas and taking on Western themes, such as Raoul Walsh's High Sierra, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole and Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground. Two directors in particular specialized in both film noir and the Western, colonizing the violent territory between them: Anthony Mann (Raw Deal, T-Men, Border Incident, Desperate, The Furies, The Naked Spur, Winchester '73) and Delmar Daves (Dark Passage, Jubal, The Badlanders, The Hanging Tree, and the 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma).And we’ll explore the 1960s – ‘70s development of the Western genre in its “revisionist” phase, seeking to interrogate the Manifest Destiny pieties that imbued the classic Western film. This revisionism has continued to inform the Western, expressing a harsher view of America’s founding principles and frontier expansion by focusing on racism, vigilante violence, political corruption, rampant capitalist exploitation, and the genocidal government policies enacted against Native Americans and people of color. We’ll see similar preoccupations in the neo-noir inflected action films of the same period, such as Point Blank, Dirty Harry, Billy Jack, and blaxploitation films such as Sweet Sweetback’s Badass Song, Shaft, and Superfly.There will be a required course reader. Students should expect to read and write a lot, watch many films, and engage in class discussion. Attendance is a must! © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  MW 1230-2P, 142 DWINELLE4 UnitsAs Paul Wells notes in Animation: Genre and Authorship,Walt Disney is viewed as the key pioneering figure in the creation of the art, commerce, and industry of animation…. Even his fiercest advocates, however, have struggled to name Disney’s mode of authorship…. [Disney] operates as a useful case study…[in our efforts] to form a view of the ways in which ‘authorship’ in animation might be evaluated.As the professed inheritors of the Walt Disney tradition in animated feature filmmaking, Pixar has revived the issue of authorship in animation. It has sought with considerable success to inherent the mantle of Walt Disney’s commercial auteur persona through the constitution of a “digital animation” auteur persona.  This process has involved the seemingly paradoxical casting of the Pixar creative team as the collective “author” of the Pixar films while at the same time privileging and publicizing the figure of the director-as-author far more than Disney Studios ever did. Drawing on the work of such film animation scholars as Paul Wells and Maureen Furniss, we will examine the process of the creation of the Pixar auteur persona and the function of the distinctive Pixar aesthetic mediating between the collective authorship of the Pixar creative team and the distinctive authorial identities of Pixar directors such as John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter.There will be a required textbook, Mauren Furniss’ Art in Motion: Animation Aesthetics, as well as a course reader. Students should expect to do a lot of reading, writing, film viewing, and class discussion! Attendance is required!  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  TuTh 8-930A, 109 DWINELLE4 UnitsPrerequisites:Consent of instructorDescription:This course is an introduction to the close analysis and evaluation of television.  Over the term of the course, we will consider a range of examples drawn from classical television series, sitcoms, dramas, news programming and contemporary reality television. Students will learn the narrative, aesthetic, and stylistic principles of television’s story-telling modes and strategies through a combination of readings, screenings, and short exercises in formal analyses.  They will also be asked to familiarize themselves with examples of television criticism. The final course project will consist of a substantial written criticism of an instance of television programming together with an oral presentation.  In addition to developing our skills as critics, we will be considering broad questions regarding the role of television and television criticism as components of society’s ongoing process of self-interpretation. What is television? What is the task of criticism? Who is the critic? How is criticism done? What justifies the existence of criticism? As part of our consideration of these broad questions, we will be concerned with the ways in which television is presently being transformed as it converges with other digital technologies.Required Texts:Available online or in Course ReaderAssignments: Television style exercise, short weekly assignments (~1 page), two in-class quizzes, final project.Class attendance is required  © UC Regents 2014.

    Felipe Gutterriez, 
  TuTh 1230-2P, 109 DWINELLE4 Units1999 saw the publication of “Deliberative Democracy or Agonistic Pluralism”, an article by Chantal Mouffe.  In this article Mouffe “examines the most recent paradigm of liberal democratic theory: ‘deliberative democracy,’ in order to bring to the fore its shortcomings.” She then proposes an alternative model of democracy that she calls “agonistic pluralism.” 
Mouffe finds the common aim of the different versions of deliberative democracy to be commendable:Against the interest-based conception of democracy, inspired by economics and skeptical about the virtues of political participation, they want to introduce questions of morality and justice into politics. They are looking for new meanings of traditional democratic notions like autonomy, popular sovereignty, and equality. However commendable the aim of theorists of deliberative democracy, Mouffe faults them for their efforts to achieve this aim through a reformulation of “the classical idea of the public sphere, giving it a central place in the democratic project.”However, by proposing to view reason and rational argumentation, instead of interest and aggregation of preferences as the central issue of politics, they simply move from an economic model to a moral one. Their move consists in replacing the market-inspired view of the public sphere by another conception that conceives political questions as being of a moral nature and therefore susceptible of being decided rationally.Mouffe provides several grounds for objecting to deliberative democracy’s procedurally based and rule-governed approach to deliberation, an approach which Jürgen Habermas’s  “ideal speech situation” exemplifies . One objection is the failure of this approach to take into account Wittgenstein’s insight that “agreement is established not on significations. . . but on a form of life . . . . It is, as has been pointed out, a . . . fusion of voices made possible by a common form of life, not . . . product of reason.” Taking into account Wittgenstein’s insight “requires reintroducing into the process of deliberation the whole rhetorical dimension that the Habermasian discourse perspective is precisely at pains to eliminate.” 
What is ultimately at stake for Mouffe in insisting on the rhetorical dimension of politics is the ineradicable dimension of power and antagonism in politics and its crucial role in the formation of collective identities. For deliberative democracy “the more democratic a society is, the less power would be constitutive of social relation.” Accepting that relations of power are constitutive of the social Mouffe claims that thequestion . . . is not how to arrive at a rational consensus reached without exclusion, that is, indeed, an impossibility. Politics aims at the creation of unity in a context of conflict and diversity; it is always concerned with the creation of an "us" by the determination of a "them." The novelty of democratic politics is not the overcoming of this us/ them distinction - which is what a consensus without exclusion pretends to achieve - but the different way in which is established. What is at stake is how to establish the us/them discrimination in a way that is compatible with pluralist democracy.This is the question that Mouffe’s model of agonistic democracy seeks to answer, and much has been written on this question since the publication of her article. In this course we will be interested in the rhetorical dimension of agonistic democracy. The two major texts that we will read in this regard are Thomas B. Farrell’s Norms of Rhetorical Culture and Aletta J. Norval’s Aversive Democracy: Inheritance and Originality in the Democratic Tradition. It is possible that reading these texts will cause us to rethink the relationship between deliberative democracy and agonistic democracy in less polemical and antithetical terms than those of Mouffe.Attendance is requiredThere will be weekly short (~ 1 page) assignments, possible short in-class or on-line quizzes (no more than 3), one 5-7 page essay and one 10-11 page essay.  © UC Regents 2014.

  MW 4-530P, 179 DWINELLE4 UnitsThis course investigates the deployment of the rhetoric of freedom and self-determination in modern legal and political texts. We track the deployment of the rhetoric of freedom in political struggles (while focusing on revolutionary, anti-colonial and slave struggles) and examine the multiple practices of freedom signified by the word. In the legal field, we investigate the revival of the concept of self-determination in the early part of the twentieth century as one formation that many freedom struggles adopted as their end. We inquire into the colonial and imperial genealogies of self-determination and explore the shifts it has undergone as it became the end of many twentieth century freedom struggles and intersected with them. Through the example of freedom and self-determination, we will explore broader questions about the intersectionality of law and politics, the political constitutive effects of modern law, and the stakes of instituting, or destabilizing, the distinction between law and politics.We will read primary political and legal sources, as well as secondary texts, including philosophical, theoretical, and historical. In addition to the several assignments of the course, such as essays and collaborative presentations, students will also produce research papers. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  TuTh 2-330P, 182 DWINELLE4 UnitsThis course in advanced topics in philosophy, law, and rhetoric proceeds as a philosophical seminar, devoted to a different inquiry each term; this term, we will be inquiring, jointly, into several fundamental questions of human being and human experience:    What is it to know?  
    How are we guided in our actions?  
    How do we understand and speak with one another?These seemingly distinct concerns are conventionally treated separately, each the province of such specialized scholarly fields as epistemology, ethics, and the philosophy of language.  This term, we shall, instead, look above all to the nexus of these questions, and to the singular experience of human being from which they emerge.As that experience is housed in language, we shall devote special attention to the ways in which language guides, shapes, and conveys that experience in its manifold unity.  With the aid of Heidegger and Aristotle, thinkers at either end of the arc of the history of thinking on these enduring philosophical concerns, we will come to see that arc as a whole, tracing where and how it has brought us, now, in late modernity, in our understandings of language, mood, intelligibility, and community, and so in our relations to the world and to one another.Please note:   All students interested in taking this class — whether pre-enrolled, wait-listed, or neither — are to attend the first class meeting, at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, January 19, in 182 Dwinelle.In planning their schedules, students should be aware that wide-ranging collective discussions, often lasting an hour or more, generally occur after the Thursday class meetings.  While attendance is voluntary, in past classes students have found these informal but intense discussions to be of substantial aid in coming to terms with difficult material encountered in the course.  You are therefore strongly encouraged to plan your schedule so as to be able to attend these sessions.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the course.Prior coursework in philosophy is not required; an openness to its challenges is.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  TuTh 330-5P, 109 DWINELLE4 UnitsGlobalization is the systematic connection and linking up of different parts of the world through various flows, exchanges, transfers and networks.  It can be divided into three aspects: the circulation of peoples and desires, the global spread of the capitalist market and mode of production (economic globalization), and the transnationalization of politics as the result of the emergence of cosmopolitan forms of political solidarity and transnational juridical forms such as human rights regimes.  At the same time, the processes of globalization are also deeply disruptive, uneven, and unequal.  They transform social relations according to the imperatives of late capitalist market culture by creating disjunctures and fragmenting social life and experience around differentiations of gender, race, and class.  Thus, every global flow, exchange or network directly involves women as subjects or objects of exchange, labor and consumption, or has profound consequences for the sex-gender relations of the societies it traverses.  The acceleration of globalization and its impact on society is greatly pronounced and intensified in Asia because of the region’s rapid development and integration into the capitalist world system.  This course examines how the various aspects of globalization bring about a fundamental reordering of gender systems, exchanges, desires, and rights in the Asia-Pacific.  Class readings and lectures will examine the nature of Orientalist and patriarchal discourse and their deployment by states, corporations, and markets in the construction of gender regimes, in facilitating and regulating the overlapping paths of people, goods, and consumer desires, and in gendering national identity.  We will also explore how the conventional links between citizenship and the nation-state are reconfigured by the political strategies of feminists, cosmopolitan human rights discourses and NGOs affecting women’s interests in Asia.

  TuTh 2-330P, B1 HEARST ANNEX4 Units What is the relationship between science and narrative?  What role does narrative play in scientific theorization, practice and ambition?  How have scientific conceptions impacted narrative forms and theories of narrative, and to what extent does the study of narrative address the structure and potential limits of scientific accounts or mathematical arguments?  This course will examine critical discussions of these questions, with examples including past and present scientific treatments of human origins and difference, as well as historicizing accounts of the natural world. © UC Regents 2014.

  Th 9-12P, 7415 DWINELLE4 UnitsThis course will examine different attempts to conceive, construct and enact sciences of the social world, examining their transformations, ruptures, and shifts from the early nineteenth century to the present.  These attempts stand as part of ongoing efforts to posit and apply notions of social justice and welfare, enactments that at the same time provoke critiques challenging the wisdom and probity of their visions and practices.  In turn, such pursuits have been stitched into the problematics of current disciplinary traditions in science and technology studies, and in history, philosophy and anthropology of science and technology – disciplines that themselves repeatedly query the relationship between scientific and sociopolitical orders. The course will return to literatures on the histories of race and science (eugenics, early statistics, anthropology), connecting them, for example, to economic literatures on wealth and development, as well as to a diversity of science studies relating to practices of mapping and municipal planning in the context of empire or recent cold war historiography.  Through such connections, this course overviews and probes relevant theoretical interventions and debates in these overlapping disciplines.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  TuTh 5-630P, 105 DWINELLE4 UnitsThe course this semester will introduce to post-foundational social and political theory, and—based on close readings of some of the main texts in the field—revisit classical text in the history of the social sciences since the nineteenth century. Together we will work on new readings of major texts in history, sociology, economics, and political science.
At the end of the first unit of the course there will be an early mid-term exam about the main concepts and models we discussed for the first couple of weeks to make sure we share an analytical language for our work with historical sources. The course will be organized in 8 units:Unit 1: How can we study the rhetoric of the social sciences?Unit 2: On the shattered grounds of the “social”—part 1Mid-term examUnit 3: SociologyUnit 4: Empirical social researchUnit 5: Political SciencUnit 6: AnthropologyUnit 7: EconomicsUnit 8: On the shattered grounds of the “social”—part 2Final essayI will take the time to work with you on a final research paper and take you, step by step, through the process of finding a topic and researching relevant literature to developing an argument and crafting an essay.Readings will include: Laclau.

  TuWTh 230-5P, 104 DWINELLE4 UnitsHave objects taken control of your life? How do advertisements for ugly or useless things compel you to buy them? What makes a tattooed body “dangerous” and an organic piece of fruit “safe”? As an ethical and political introduction to design theory in the 20th and 21st centuries, “Is Design Evil?” will provide a framework for addressing both the skepticism and the fear often associated with design. The course begins by trying to define design and its physical and psychological effects on people. We will try to determine what constitutes a human artifact and how philosophical notions like idea, materiality, and productive intention inform the discourse of design. This will prepare us to question design in relation to its power and control of thinking and behavior. We then turn to the practice of critique. Designed objects surround us. With what attitude, critical methodologies, and concepts should we engage them and evaluate their supposed malevolence? We spend each of the next four weeks considering different design disciplines through which we will practice design criticism. In order, these disciplines include graphic design, product design and advertising, game design, and urban design. The syllabus will consist of essays, a novel, and films. Since this is not a studio course, no individual design ability is required. We will, however, occasionally complete in­class design exercises for the purposes of improving our critical analysis. Also note that this course will not seriously investigate the “problem of evil,” as formulated in the philosophy of religion. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  TuWTh 230-5P, 88 DWINELLE4 UnitsThis course provides students with tools they can use to make better, more compelling, arguments and also to read arguments in better, more critical, ways. We will draw the tools for our argumentative toolboxes from the long history of rhetoric, from sophistical dissoi logoi, to the Aristotelian appeals, to Quintilian's four master tropes, to the rich archive of formal and informal fallacies, to argument modeled on litigation via Toulmin's schema, to argument modeled on mediation via Rogerian synthesis, to the pragmatism of the ends of argument. All the while we are workshopping these technical skills we will also be reading and discussing a range of texts that tackle questions of the reach and forms of violence and nonviolence in historical struggle and in everyday life. These texts will likewise draw from a long history, from Thucydides to Thomas Jefferson, Immanuel Kant, Martin Luther King, Jr., Frantz Fanon, Dorothy Day, Hannah Arendt, Arundhati Roy, Judith Butler, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. We will also talk through a play by Euripides, an essay by Nietzsche, a novel by Octavia Butler, a film by Cronenberg… The crucial thing to understand about the course is that we will not be taking on two separate projects, one practical and another theoretical. This course proposes that there is an indispensable relation between the traditional focus of rhetoric as instruction in the art of making compelling arguments and the theoretical preoccupation of many rhetoricians with questions of what violence or compulsion ultimately consists. It is commonplace to see Persuasion offered up as an alternative to the violent adjudication of disputes or hear Argument idealized as a space "outside" of violence. But the truth is that many arguments rely on the acceptance of a violent status quo or depend on conventional assumptions that deny marginal testimonies to violation. Also, many arguments stealthily threaten violence while at once congratulating themselves on their peacefulness. Ultimately, the course proposes that it is rhetoric's definitive concern with the traffic between the literal and figurative dimensions of language and its situated understanding of truth-telling that connects the work of rhetoric with a project of reconciliation that resists violence even as we cannot help but risk it.  © UC Regents 2014.

  TuWTh 2-430P, 215 DWINELLE4 UnitsIn this course, we will explore the political rhetoric of fanaticism by investigating various representations of fanaticism in contemporary Anglophone fiction. We will read a selection of recent novels with an attentiveness not only to aesthetic but also to philosophical, political, and theoretical concerns. The course will feature novels such as The Children Act (2014) by Ian McEwan, The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007) by Mohsin Hamid, and Purple Hibiscus (2003) by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. We will ask how the novels frame and articulate fanaticism—in legal, political, theological, and/or historical terms—and what is at stake in such choices. The course will engage writers and theorists from a range of geographical, religious, and political backgrounds, and much of our discussion will have a comparative focus. We will read various theorists and philosophers (John Locke, G. Hegel, Michel Foucault, Wendy Brown, Ranajit Guha) in order to ask how the fanatic has been variously theorized in relation to the political community. The course will situate and explore the contemporary rhetoric of fanaticism within a tradition of political and aesthetic thought.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

This introductory course explores different forms of reasoning, from science, law, history, literature, among other fields. Topics include: deduction and induction, rule vs. case-based reasoning, evidence, hypothetical thinking, analogy-making, and narrative.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsIn Ancient Greece and Rome, the practice and theory of rhetoric was a source of constant debate and inquiry. The very question, “What is rhetoric?,” prompted consternation and confusion, dialogue and dissent. Who were the ancient rhetoricians and how did they define the way they used words and argument? What relationships, both positive and negative, did rhetoric forge with philosophy, poetry, historiography, politics and the law? Was rhetoric a skill that could be taught to everyone? This course will begin by investigating the origins of rhetoric in Ancient Greece and follow its transformation in fifth- and fourth-century Athens through close study of the texts of Thucydides, Gorgias, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, among others. We will then turn our attention to the art of rhetoric in Ancient Rome from the end of the Republic to Christian late Antiquity through close readings of works by Cicero, Longinus and Augustine. Throughout the semester, we will focus on how authors delineated the psychological, political, and philosophical power and effects of rhetorical speech as well as on how this special speech transformed perceptions, interpretations, and actions.   © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThe course introduces to the history and rhetoric of the science of the unconscious and its influence on modern culture. We will analyze how the unconscious emerges within the history of modern rationality and how the concept of the psychoanalytical unconscious is modeled against 19th century historical thinking: When did the idea of an unconscious first surface? How could a whole science of the unconscious emerge? What kind of intellectual and cultural settings made it possible to perceive of an unconscious that by definition could not become an object of knowledge? Why does the unconscious remain an important interpretive model?By the end of the 19th century, the concept of the unconscious had become not only an interpretive model but a world view that changed the place of the subject in modern culture. The course will explore the history of the unconscious and its early beginnings (Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Hartmann) to the emergence of a psychoanalytical unconscious (Charcot, Freud, Jung, Lacan, Legendre, de Certeau). We will pay particular attention to intellectual (e.g. hypnosis, talking cure, cultures of collecting) and cultural practices (the couch, early film, bureaucracy and legal culture) of the unconscious.Readings will include:- Various texts by Descartes, Freud, Hartmann, Charcot, Jung, Lacan etc.

  4 UnitsParticipants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer (the Iliad and Odyssey); and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed (adapted, used, quoted, sometimes maligned and abused, sometimes creatively reshuffled, translated into different media—first writing, then sculpture, painting, poetry, cinema—or transposed into geographical and archaeological inquiries) while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today. And because this tradition has had to invent its source (Homer, whose identity is utterly mysterious and may turn out to be an idea, not a person), the tradition is literally eccentric in all of its manifestations: at its center stands an absent and empty name (“Homer”) and an unanswerable question (“Who was Homer?”). Wrestling with these dilemmas has long been a productive way to generate new cultural forms and especially new “untimely” critiques of the often violent but ever alluring foundations of our culture. This process is still alive today.Readings will include selections of early and later Greek and Roman revisions of Homer (Stesichorus, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod, Homeric Lives, Gorgias, Plato, Aristotle, Longinus, and Roman Greek sophistic authors and various works of art), as well as some of their modern counterparts, above all philosophers and cultural critics: Vico (The New Science), Swift (The Battle of the Books), Hegel (Aesthetics), Nietzsche (The Birth of Tragedy §§1-5; “Homer’s Contest,” Untimely Meditations, sels.), Horkheimer and Adorno (The Dialectic of Enlightenment), Auerbach (Mimesis, sels.), Simone Weil (The Iliad, or the Poem of Force), Rachel Bespaloff (War and the Iliad), Derek Walcott (Omeros), Margaret Atwood (The Penelopiad), Christopher Logue (War Music), Kate Tempest (Brand New Ancients) and Paul Chan (Odysseus as Artist). Secondary readings, providing background and context, will accompany the primary materials.Requirements: short writing assignments (bi-weekly blog postings and responses), a final (id's and essays), and one final collaborative project in any medium, including any non-textual medium (oral/aural, visual, or digital) to be presented during the last week of class.

  4 UnitsIn this course we will examine the three main phases of the zombie film genre, which develops as a subcategory of the American horror film. We will consider the historical context of the genre, the theories and common critical analyses applied to the genre, the prevalent narrative structures of the films, and the defining films of the genre as well as the anomalous ones.First phase: the zombie film of the classic Hollywood studio film era, which was inspired by the American cultural fascination with the Haitian voodoo zombie as reported by journalists and amateur anthropologists during the American military occupation of Haiti (1915 – 1934). Films include White Zombie, I Walked With a Zombie, and King of the Zombies.Second phase: the zombie film as redefined by George A. Romero in his seminal 1960s-‘80s trilogy Night of the Living Dead/Dawn of the Dead/Day of the Dead. Romero’s first zombie film was conceived in terms of the counter-culture movement of the 1960s, and his own believe in an imminent and necessary socio-political revolution, which established the zombie film as working in terms of topicality and cultural critique.And third phase: the post-Romero zombie films which tend to update and work out the implications of Romero’s vision. These include “classic” zombie film remakes (some by Romero himself), parodies such as Dead-Alive, Shaun of the Dead, and Zombieland, and genre-revisionist films such as Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later. We will also study the extension of the zombie genre into other pop culture forms, i.e. the graphic novel/TV series The Walking Dead, popular novels optioned for film adaptation such as World War Z, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and Breathers: A Love Story, and zombie-oriented video/computer games such as Resident Evil, House of the Dead, (both adapted for film), and Doom 3.There will be a lot of reading, writing, film viewing, and discussion in this course. The screening lab is required. Class and screening attendance is a must!

  4 UnitsThe course surveys critical controversies surrounding fakes, forgeries, multiples, counterfeits, imitations, and appropriations from the Late Renaissance to the present day, in European, American, Australian and Chinese art. Each of the images and objects we will examine sparked extensive debate in art history, philosophy, anthropology, social theory or legal studies, around which we will build our own discussions. Through a series of historical case studies, we will track how copies are excised—and sometimes reinstated—into the status of art, and delve into the impact of the copy on the rhetorics of authorship, genius, individuality, expertise and technology. We will be reading theoretical texts on copies in various historical and cultural contexts, with an eye towards learning the various disciplinary methods that have been taken up to define and evaluate them. Two writing assignments and a final research paper are designed to develop our awareness to the rhetorics of visual and material analysis, and of historical narratives of invention, imitation and appropriation.  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThere is no better way to create unity and a sense of common purpose than through the creation of others—as dangers to be quarantined, persecuted, feared, or destroyed.  In America these targets have taken diverse forms: witches, communists, intellectuals, “cultural elites,” terrorists, etc.  Despite its many and changing figurations, the trope of the other has played a crucial—perhaps even a defining—role in American politics. In this class, we will be particularly interested in the most recent history of this rhetoric; our aim will be try to understand it in context.  That is to say, we will try to understand the genealogy of a number of different instances (or targets, if you will) of this rhetoric, both in terms of the unique socio-historical situations within which they appeared (e.g., the existential angst of the nuclear age, economic crises, the civil rights movement, feminism, 9-11, or the twenty-four hour consumer/media cycle), and in terms of more durable, longer term, histories of religious revivalism, notions of American exceptionalism, and traditions associated with rugged individualism and the spirit of the frontier.   We will focus our discussions and our readings on the presidential election.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThrough the examination of various media, from texts to films, to audio media, we will explore the formation of our early American cultural character and identity, and how that culture has subsequently affected our contemporary society.  We will start with the question of what is American culture, and whether there is a discernable cultural identity in our society. This course meets the public discourse requirement in the Department of Rhetoric.Jane Smiley in a Harper’s article in 1996 wrote the following regarding the role race plays in American society.  She was commenting on what she perceived were the shortcomings of Samuel Clemen’s [Mark Twain] Huckleberry Finn:“…Americans always think racism is a feeling, and they reject it or they embrace it. To most Americans, it seems more honorable and nicer to reject it, so they do, but they almost invariably fail to understand that how they feel means very little to black Americans, who understand racism as a way of structuring American culture,…”What does it mean to suggest that race could be viewed as a way to “structure” our culture, and is there evidence to support such a contention? In the attempt to make sense of this question, I will propose a connection between the sociological concept of “cultural trauma” and the formation of the nation’s cultural identity.1.  We will start with readings on culture and the theory of cultural trauma, to provide a context.2.  Then we will move to historical and cultural narrative beginning with James Fennimore Cooper's The Pioneers; America’s first popular and iconic fictional work.By using this historical romance novel as an interpretation of American cultural identity, the class will view the development of American society and culture as a “formal problem.”  That is, the novel poses a symbolic and thematic problem in which the three principal racial groups in early North America (i.e., the Native Americans, the European-Americans, and the African-Americans) are symbolically structured into the social and political order in colonial American and in the new nation.All subsequent readings will be viewed in the context of that formal problem and Cooper’s solution.   The symbolism of American narrative may reveal how our public discourse reflects our society and culture.3.  Ante-bellum readings will be matched with more contemporary cultural artifacts and symbolism in film clips and documentary media. This class is focused around the discussion of course materials so preparation for class and reading materials in advance are required; you may be called on to present reading interpretations to the rest of the class.4.  Readings include original texts in American literature and letters (e.g. My Bondage, My Freedom by Frederick Douglass, Moby Dick by Herman Melville, Huckleberry Finn by Samuel Clemens, along with readings from D.H. Lawrence, William Carlos Willliams, the New York Review of Books, etc.). There will also be historical articles, theoretical material, and criticism collected in supplementary readings in a course reader that will analyze the eras from which the works emerged, issues that shaped the history of early America, and contemporary connections. Film clips (ranging from the “Big Bang Theory” to Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing”, James Cameron’s “Avatar” and “Terminator II”, to Sixty Minutes and the PBS “The American Experience”) will supplement formal reading material in each class as examples of narrative.5.  Classes begin with film clips and may involve student presentation of reading materials before we break into a full discussion. We will be open to all perspectives, no matter how controversial or widely shared. But we will be respectful of one another, and speak in language not aimed at individuals or personalities, but at issues.There will be a take-home midterm essay, an essay/project making use of course materials and themes, and a take-home essay final exam.  Attendance, participation in discussions, and office hour visits are part of course grading. Early in the semester, there will be a mandatory Friday night pot-luck dinner and/or film gathering.  I will provide you with dates in the syllabus.Required Texts:James Fennimore Cooper, The Pioneers; 
Herman Melville, Moby-Dick; 
Frederick Douglas, My Bondage, My Freedom;

  4 UnitsThe course of recent political, legal, and social thought is the course of thinking on human beings’ relation to the world and to one another, a course that emerges from and reflects underlying understandings of the nature of truth and sense, of right and obligation, of connection and distance prevailing in that time – in our time.Most recently, the course of these relations and understandings has brought political and economic upheavals, accelerating scientific and industrial transformation, and a widening sense of flux, volatility, and dislocation.  In response to these events, contemporary political, legal, and social theory has offered its accounts and resources to the end of identifying the issues, preserving the advantages, and solving the problems seen in these events.  In this seminar, we will undertake, not to add to those already ample efforts, but to step back from them, the better to keep the time and situation to which they are responding in view.  We will ask instead after the course of those events and efforts itself, that we might illuminate the arc of those political, legal, and social theoretic efforts, and that of late modernity to which they are responding, as a whole: What underlies the singular, distinctively contemporary course of world events and of the political, legal, and social theoretic efforts it elicits?What understandings of truth and right, of time and world, of human being and human relations underlie this course, giving it its distinctive shape and way?With the aid of insights drawn from Heidegger and Nietzsche, we will undertake a philosophical investigation into the world-situation that holds sway prior to theoretical and practical activity and sets it on its way.  To that end, we shall come to address not only the understandings of truth, right, and politics at work in contemporary political, legal, and social discourse, but these conceptions’ origins, affinities, and precursors in implicit understandings of the world (in the widest sense), of human being, and of their relation. We shall thereby be drawn into reflection upon how it is that contemporary thought about politics, law, and society — and, with it, our own thinking on such matters — has come to take the course that it has; giving our sustained attention to inquiring into the grounds, nature, and implications of this course as a whole, we come to think anew regarding the world and the time in which we dwell.Please note:   The course is an intensive seminar; prepared, participatory attendance is obligatory.  Students are advised to plan their schedules accordingly.The instructor will limit enrollment as necessary, and will consider for enrollment only those students in attendance from the outset.  Accordingly, all students interested in taking this class — whether pre-enrolled, wait-listed, or neither — are to attend the first class meeting.In planning their schedules, students should be aware that wide-ranging collective discussions, often lasting an hour or more, generally occur after each class meeting.  In past classes students have found these informal but intense discussions to be highly engaging and of substantial aid in coming to terms with difficult material encountered in the course.  You are therefore strongly encouraged to plan your schedule so as to be able to attend these sessions.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the course.Prior coursework in philosophy is not required; an openness to its challenges is.

  4 UnitsThis course traces the developments in Western legal theory from the natural legal tradition to the positivist tradition of the nineteenth century. We investigate how the world was articulated in both traditions, as consisting of material and non-material elements, of land and sea and air, of the natural and the divine. We inquire into how a vision of a unified world came into being in the seventeenth century, the place that the sea played in this unification, and the development of the related law of the sea. We also probe the force of the divine and nature that different legal theorists articulated in their depiction of the world, and trace the rise of the modern state as the world’s main constitutive unit. The objective is to think beyond the limitations of our contemporary world order by historicizing it, and along the way examining other legal traditions of thinking about the world and their potentialities in the contemporary moment. The course will be divided into three parts corresponding to three historical periods: the medieval, the early modern, and the modern. Each part will highlight a key text (the required books for the course), in addition to a number of additional texts that you will find in the course reader.Required books:

  4 UnitsInquiries into the self, its nature, its possibilities, and its limits are a mainstay of contemporary theoretical, cultural, and political thought. Historical perspectives from antiquity onward are capable of challenging and enriching this kind of inquiry.  The aim of this interdisciplinary graduate seminar is to investigate changing theories and practices of the self between antiquity and the present, while encouraging participants from both the humanities and social sciences to develop lines of research that meet their individualprograms of study.The format of the seminar will be unusual.  Conceived as an extended workshop where collaborative thinking is valued, the seminar will be organized around a series of distinguished guest speakers who have made strong contributions to the study of the self in a wide range of fields.  Each invited guest will lead a seminar session based on a selection of his or her own work (published or unpublished) and accompanied by supporting primary and secondary readings.During the week prior to each visit, the seminar will be devoted to extensive discussions of the materials and the problems raised by each presenter’s topic and readings.  Students will have the unique opportunity to collaborate across disciplines and to engage closely with some of the leading scholars in the humanities today.Seminar guests will include A. A. Long (Classics and Philosophy, Berkeley), Jonathan Lear (Committee on Social Thought and Philosophy, University of Chicago), Brooke Holmes (Classics, Princeton), Carolyn Walker Bynum (Institute of Advanced Studies, Princeton, emerita), Sara Magrin (Classics and Philosophy, Berkeley), and Galen Strawson (Philosophy, University of Texas, Austin).Requirements:  Bi-weekly blog postings in response to the readings, in-class presentations, and a final research paper.Enrollment is limited to 20 students.  This course fulfills the elective requirement (CT290) for the Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory.For Fall 2016 only, this course will complete the RH200 requirement for Rhetoric graduate students.

  4 UnitsThe seminar this semester will consider some of the ways in which law is a system of information. Some readings will be quite grounded accounts of law and writing or documents; others will consist in more theoretical approaches to contemporary law and its critique. The aim is to offer an overview of possible approaches to law and legal texts for students with little background in law and/or little background in humanities, while simultaneously allowing students who have the background to delve deeper into issues of law, knowledge and “information.” Although the focus of the readings is on US/Europe or common law/civil law, students interested in other areas or laws are welcome.  Brief presentations and a 20-page polished paper are required.

  4 UnitsWhat are the world’s constitutive forces and dimensions, how have its signifiers shifted, and what are the political and ethical consequences of these shifts? Several contemporary disciplines that attach the concept “world” to their objects of inquiry (e.g. world history, world literature, world politics, world agriculture, world cinema) take the world to consist of territorial units (such as the state), the relationships between them, and the movements across them in time. The world, in these accounts, is an expanding stage to be progressively captured by history, law, politics as well as other disciplines that are preoccupied with comparison, translation, and movement. Alternatively, the critical versions of these disciplines emphasize the politics of translatability, including untranslatability. These critical versions refuse the unification of the world and the homogenization of its markers. Nevertheless, they share in the assumption that the world is a material stage for human and nonhuman forms of life, production and movement. In this seminar, we trace the historical rise of the world as a territorial stage in legal and political thought, and explore its material unification by the bonds of the sea, thereby enabling the world’s expansion and its (colonial) capturing (as in the oceanic journeys of the fifteenth century). We juxtapose this rise to narratives about the sea that endow it with other horizons and disruptive potentialities. In addition, we trace articulations of the world that did not limit it to nation states, as in the nineteenth century signifier “the international,” which also brought about a more radical split between the local and the international. We probe the possibility of a world not constituted by the split between domestic and international law. Special attention will be also given to the temporal and other non-material dimensions of the world, as articulated in pre-modern, including Islamic, theological accounts, and their potential persistence in contemporary concepts, even as time, too, has transformed and become homogenous. Our readings will include texts from the natural law tradition, political and legal thought, Islamic theological texts, continental philosophy, and histories of the early modern state, territory, sea and time.
Note: I am organizing a two-day workshop titled ‘World, Imperium, International: Thinking with Ottoman and Islamic Pasts.” Students enrolled in the seminar will be encouraged to read the pre-circulated papers of the invited participants and attend the workshop.   © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsA widespread historiographic, scientific, philosophical and cultural narrative is that humanity has increasingly been realizing its own marginality. This course will examine historical and contemporary underpinnings of this narrative, focusing attention on traditional and ongoing understandings of humanity as peripheral, understandings that shadow, are in explicit dialogue with and conceptually dependent on constructions of humanity as central. The historiographical, philosophical and literary depictions of chastised human vanity themselves point to the mirroring operation of the construction of human marginality. Across the historical and conceptual field of both this chastisement and the aesthetic and ethical defenses of human centrality, we will follow the shifting places in which anthropocentricism has been argued to reveal itself and as needing to be rooted out, claims that have called attention as much to the spiritual status of humanity, as to its scientific mastery and its technological and environmental dominance. From this perspective, we will examine claims regarding the present-day relationship between natural historical and human historical narratives, and likewise, the way in which historical periodizations such as the anthropocene can be critiqued and defended as either anthropocentric or anthroperipheral. We will further examine literary and documentary material thematizing questions of this periphery.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsModern US law is very much a matter of language. In this course, we will learn about the history of the English language and, in so doing, learn about the history of US legal language. We will read three great examples of English-language literature concerned with law (Chaucer-Middle English, Shakespeare-Early Modern English, Twain-Modern (19th-Century) American), as well as legal materials and secondary sources on figures of speech and on performative utterances. The aim is to refine students’ abilities to read difficult texts, to understand law and literature as works of language, and to explore how language claims justice.Requirements: Three 5 – 7 page papers; several short assignments or quizzes; attendance and participation.  (NOTE: students who do not attend for the first two weeks will be dropped in favor of students who do.)Required texts:Austin, How to Do Things with WordsBarfield, History in English WordsChaucer, Prologue, Man of Law’s TaleQuinn, Figures of SpeechShakespeare, Measure for MeasureAnna Deavere Smith, TwilightThomas, Plessy v Ferguson, A Brief History with DocumentsTwain, Pudd’nhead WilsonPhotocopied reader/bCourse materials © UC Regents 2014.

  1 UnitsFor 1 unit only.This seminar will explore the work of the most influential psychoanalyst writing in English today, Christopher Bollas (http://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/christopher-bollas), who will be scholar-in-residence at the Townsend Center in the first week of November 2016. Seminar participants will discuss Bollas's published works (including The Freudian Moment, The Shadow of the Object, Being a Character, and When the Sun Bursts: The Enigma of Schizophrenia) as well as forthcoming and in-progress work that he will provide. Students will present their own projects to the group, and will develop questions to be tabled for seminars with Bollas himself and for one-on-one meetings with him during his residency.Participants must be able to attend the seminars and one-on-one meetings with Bollas, as well as the events of Bollas’s residency. Professor Whitney Davis (History of Art) convenes the three seminar sessions, which meet on Wednesday, September 21 and October 5, and Tuesday, October 18, all from 5:15 pm – 7 pm.  Participants must attend all three sessions, participate in one-on-one meetings with Bollas, and attend the associated public events of his residency that take place daily from October 31 through November 4.The mini-course is open to graduate students in any program, for 1-unit credit.Advance communication with and permission of the instructors required (wmdavis@berkeley.edu and tansmana@berkeley.edu).  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsIn accordance with the University of California’s Reading and Composition (R&C) 1A requirement, this course offers rigorous training in analytical reading, thinking, and writing. It will introduce research methodologies, preparing students for successful academic careers across disciplines while presenting approaches and discourses from the field of rhetoric. The focus on discourses of religion emphasizes analytical abstract thinking, while putting theoretical texts from various disciplines into conversation with current events, literature, and film. Eight units guide students through some important debates in the field, including on universality, hermeneutics, epistemology, and modernism, engaging topics including power, agency, violence, and imperialism. The syllabus includes works from Al-Ghazâlî, Talal Asad, Averroës, Daniel Boyarin, Octavia Butler, Italo Calvino, Aimé Césaire, Severin Fowles, Immanuel Kant, Ursula Kroeber Le Guin, Saba Mahmood, Friedrich Nietzsche, Benson Saler, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsIn this course we will take up the body as an object of study, paying particular attention to how the body is figured in political, philosophical, and scientific discourse. We will start the semester by questioning how we define the body in ontological (what a body is), hermeneutical (what a body means) and epistemological (how a body means) terms. We will then interrogate how the body is constituted and inscribed in relation to social space and its material environment. We will end the course by considering how science and technology alter or supplement our understanding of the body and reconstitute its boundaries. Some of the questions we will ask this semester include: What determines a "normal" or “healthy” body versus an abnormal one? How do race, gender, sexuality, and other markers of social difference mediate what a body can do? How might forms of embodiment provide the condition of possibility for political and social change? How do we differentiate the human from the non-human body? Is the body a purely "natural" or biological organism? Is it a product of "culture"? How does technology complicate the nature/culture divide? Examining the body as a site of political investment and production, this class will study texts by writers including Michel Foucault, Saidiya Hartman, René Descartes, Frantz Fanon, Octavia Butler and others to contemplate how and to what end the body is produced and constituted by power and how it might provide the grounds for resistance.The course will be divided into three units organized thematically:
1) Somatics of Truth
2) Geographies of the Body
3) The (Bio-)Technological Prosthesis  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThis course examines the relationship between disability, aesthetics, and social life. We will consider how conceptions of impairment and disability have developed throughout the 20th century. Our focus will be on artists, writers, and theorists who approach disability as a site of social struggle and activism, and as a marker of novelty and creative experimentation. We’ll explore the philosophical writings of John Dewey and Georges Canguilhem—thinkers who view pathologies as opportunities for biological and social systems to engage in radical reorganization. As we consider the disabled body’s potential to disrupt the status quo, we’ll look at modernist literature as well as so-called “outsider art.” While experimental art practices are often seen as attempts to break with cultural traditions, we’ll take a slightly different approach by studying the link between aesthetic novelty and the unpredictable variability of human biology.  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThree hours of lecture and one hour of discussion per week. Prerequisites: 10 or consent of instructor. Formerly 101. A broad consideration of the historical relationship between philosophy, literature, and rhetoric, with special emphasis on selected themes within the early modern and modern periods.This course surveys some key theoretical texts from the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries that shed light on how meaning is both produced and interrogated in modernity. One of the key accomplishments of the modern era is the development of critical stances that question the appearance, objectivity and naturalness of texts and acts. These stances also reveal the power operations of texts and things. We examine the making of these stances: how they came to being, their practices, their attention to power, and their intellectual and political consequences. What are the modes of thinking, reading and interpretation that have been consequently introduced? And what should constitute our objects of inquiry in the search for understanding: where should we look and what should we study? We begin with Marx’s critique of ideology, and end with the approaches of science studies that question the meta-narrative of modernity, and its divisions between the realm of humans and the realm of things and nature. Other theorists will help us to consider the relationship between discourse and power, modes of reading, the persistence of the singular, psychoanalysis, subjugation and deconstruction.   © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsBefore the psyche there was the soul, a principle of creaturely life (psyche, anima). But life is never independent of its entanglements with the social, the political, and nature. This course will examine theories of psychic life in four foundational works that explore these entanglements, in a dialogue that runs from classical antiquity to the early twentieth century and beyond: Plato’s Republic, Aristotle’s On the Soul, Lucretius’ On the Nature of Things, and Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams. Time permitting, the last two weeks will be devoted to exploring a “test case”: Virginia Woolf’s Orlando: A Biography. Secondary readings from contemporary theorists will be discussed on a selective basis. Students from all fields welcome. No prerequisites. In-class presentations, a mid-term, and a short final paper (10-12 pp.).  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThis course explores a pivotal period in English history and religious thought, beginning in 1534, when King Henry VIII’s Act of Supremacy severed England’s ties to the Catholic Church and established the Church of England, and ending in 1660, the year the English monarchy was reinstated after the English Civil Wars.  Borrowing methodological approaches from the sociology of religion, we will think about how politics, faith, and culture intersect:  how subjectivity can be constructed and constrained by rhetorics of religious orthodoxy;  how political institutions set the parameters for religious practice and establish the consequences for dissent;  how notions of conscience, self-expression, and political speech evolved out of contentious struggles about religious expression and identity;  and how ordinary men and women managed conflicts between spiritual obligation and political mandate.  We will read a variety of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, including devotional poems, religious meditations, plays, news accounts, scientific treatises, and philosophical tracts, as we examine religious change as a political, social, and cultural phenomenon.  Critical readings will include works by Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, Eamon Duffy, Sarah Beckwith, Stephen Greenblatt, and more. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsInquiry into the rhetoric of philosophical discourse, by way of an exploration of the history of philosophical engagement with the question of truth.What is truth?   How do we speak of it?   What is in question, in the question of truth?These seem odd questions to us now, when we speak of truth as such — if we do at all —with irony or scare quotes, when speech instead takes recourse to issues of power or instances of shifting truths, as truth’s intelligibility and very possibility are said to be in doubt.  Yet for over two millennia philosophy was centrally occupied with the question of the nature and ground of truth.  How has philosophy come to take the course that it has?  Where has that course brought us, such that we now find the question of truth obscure, even dispensable?  How might both the question of truth and our contemporary estrangement from it be illuminated by tracing that course and finding our place along it?Course readings will be drawn from significant classic and contemporary works in Western thought on truth’s nature,  ground, and possibility, including those of Plato, Aristotle,  Descartes, Hume, Kant, Wittgenstein, Foucault, Nietzsche, and Heidegger.  With their aid we shall enter into a sustained inquiry into the history of truth and its pursuit in philosophy, to the end of contemplating the course and ground of our understanding of thinking, of truth, of language, of history, and of who we are and have become that we think on truth as we do.  Affording students the opportunity of immersion in the history and practice of Western philosophy in its enduring concern with the question of truth, this intensive seminar offers a course in (not simply "on") the rhetoric of philosophical discourse.Prior exposure to philosophy is not required; an openness to its challenges is.Please note:  All students interested in taking this class — whether pre-enrolled, wait-listed, or neither — are to attend the first class meeting, 5-6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, January 17 in Room 247, Dwinelle Hall.In planning their schedules, students should be aware that wide-ranging collective discussions, often lasting an hour or more, will generally occur during office hours on Thursday afternoons.  In past classes, students have found these informal but intense discussions to be of substantial help in coming to terms with difficult material encountered in the course.  Students are strongly encouraged to plan their schedules so as to be able to attend these sessions.Required texts:José Medina and David Wood, eds., Truth:  Engagements Across Philosophical Traditions (Blackwell, 2005).

  4 UnitsCan you live ethically without following moral norms—norms that are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and convention? The question is at least as old as the Cynics, and it remains a vital problem today. This course will examine the issues through a close study of Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morals and Adorno’s Minima Moralia. Supplementary readings will include selections from Bernard Williams, Carl Schmitt, additional readings from Nietzsche and Adorno, and more recent theory. This is not a course in philosophy (though philosophy majors are welcome). It is a course in radical thought and radical writing. No prerequisites.

  4 UnitsThe “American” family comes in many shapes, forms and sizes—as does the fiction about it.  There are short stories, novels, poems, memoirs, graphic novels, television shows, to mention but a few sites where narratives and images, descriptions and expressions, praise and blame, about the family happen.  This course proposes to explore the multiple rhetorical representations of the family—the unhappy, “American,” family, which, as Tolstoy has taught us (regarding an entirely different family), is “unhappy in its own way.”  Coupled with readings from history, philosophy, literary criticism, gender theory and sociology, we will examine critically how the nuclear family (in particular) shapes and misshapes, forms and deforms identities and aspirations, relationships and attachments, values and loyalties. We will devote ourselves to comprehending the fictions of the family that emerge in nineteenth- to twenty-first century- narratives.  However, we will begin (as I often do) with the Ancient Greek tragedians for they have guided, for better and for worse, our vision of familial influences and structures.Provisional Reading and Viewing List:Authors:  Sophocles and Euripides, Sigmund Freud, Henry James, Charles Dickens, Louisa May Alcott, Eudora Welty, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov, John Cheever, Amy Tan, Barack Obama, Alison Bechtel, Philip Roth.Television Shows:  “Father Knows Best,” “Make Room for Daddy,” “The Bill Cosby Show,” “Dallas.” Requirements and Special Features:  1) To enroll in this class you must have completed two of the following courses: RH10, RH20, RH103a or RH103b.  If you are not a Rhetoric student, please speak with me on the first day of class.  You are required to have finished at least half of the introductory courses in your major.  2) This will be a writing-intensive seminar, with many different forms of writing assigned.  3) As often as possible, this class will be “flipped.”  Student participation is an essential component. 4) When necessary, television screenings will be scheduled outside class time, at a time convenient for all.  5) Finally, by the second day of class, you will have to hand in a 250-word typed-statement about a family—other than your own.  Upon completion, you will be admitted into the class.*From Philip Larkin, “This Be the Verse”  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsWhat is autobiography and why is it so popular these days?  Are we all so self-obsessed?  Or so accountable to others?  How is autobiography a medium of self-knowledge, anyway?   Aren’t all modes of self-reference autobiographical?  We’ll ask these questions, and more, studying autobiography as rhetorical activity that takes many forms.  We will read some classics, including Augustine’s Confessions, Rousseau’s Confessions, and Frederick Douglass’s Narrative; some new classics, including Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home and Are You My Mother, Nan Goldin’s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, and one of the six volumes of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle; and some esoteric texts, such as Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, Joe Brainard’s I Remember, and our friends’ Snapchat stories and Facebook archives. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsBecause it is notoriously difficult to define the term “Gothic,” or to describe its complex history as an aesthetic form involving architecture, “high” literature and popular fiction, painting, opera, theater, cinema, television, gaming, and fashion, we will be working toward an understanding of the Gothic throughout the semester. Our study of Gothic horror in film will be a challenging one, as Misha Kavka argues in her essay “Gothic on Screen”:…There is no established genre called Gothic cinema or Gothic film. There are Gothic images and Gothic plots and Gothic characters and even Gothic styles within films, but there is no delimited or demonstrable genre specific to film called the Gothic. This is at least in part due to the fact that film, as a medium born with the twentieth century, is both a latecomer to and an avid, unabashed plagiarizer of earlier literary forms of the Gothic. As such, the “Gothic” does not “belong” to film, and the film medium must content itself with providing a home for that catch-all category of terror and spookiness, the horror genre.Nonetheless, if it is surprising that there is no such thing as Gothic cinema, that is because we perfectly well know the Gothic when we see it. There is, in fact, something peculiarly visual about the Gothic….[T]he Gothic tantalizes us with fear, both as its subject and its effect; it does so, however, not primarily through characters or plots or even language, but through spectacle. The fearful effect of the Gothic, at least in its literary forms, depends on our ability to cast certain conventionalized images from the text onto the “screen” of our mind’s eye….…[I]t may be as much as one can do to say that the Gothic is about fear, localized in the shape of something monstrous which electrifies the collective mind. But in that case, how do we distinguish the Gothic from the catch-all film genre of horror? It is useful, perhaps, to specify that the Gothic is about paranoia, defined as a projection of the self on the outside world, which in turn is read as hostile. Paranoia thus involves a blurring of the boundaries between self and other, to the extent that the other becomes a version of the self returned, with interest, in the form of hostility. This blurring of the boundaries depends precisely on the fear of a return, for something which has been expelled may well come back, half-expected, from the other side or the beyond. Julie Kristeva refers to this something as “the abject” in Powers of Horror, while Sigmund Freud has famously called it “the return of the repressed,” a return of something which has always been there (in the unconscious) and whose sudden appearance calls up the feeling of the “uncanny” or the unfamiliar that is deeply familiar.In this context we can recognize more easily the visual codes of the Gothic such as the doppelgangers, wandering ghosts, and risen corpses, the ruined, decaying, haunted, and abandoned dwellings, mysterious towers, secret passageways, hidden rooms, ambiguous and imprisoning shadows, the obscuring weather effects of mists, fogs, rains, and snows, the manifestations of psychological slippage in mad staring eyes, entranced and sleepwalking figures, and projected dreams, flashbacks, and hallucinations.We will be considering several categories of films that are most often discussed in terms of the Gothic: German Expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu; “classic” Universal horror films including Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Mummy; Val Lewton’s “fear by suggestion” horror films such as Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie; the Hollywood female Gothic films of the 1940s such as Rebecca, Gaslight, and The Uninvited; film noir; the British supernatural and “Hammer Horror” films; the many adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories; and later iterations of the Gothic such as The Shining, The Blair Witch Project, The Woman in Black, the Paranormal Activity films, and the Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan Batman films. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsIn the introduction to Color: The Film Reader, Brian Price argues that until recently film studies scholars have suffered from “chromophobia,” neglecting to address in any comprehensive way “the centrality of color to the experience and technology of cinema”:The neglect of color in film studies is a curious one. Color is not simply a choice a filmmaker makes at the level of film stock…[but] a constructive element of mise-en-scene, one that works alongside of lighting, sound, performance, camera movement, framing, and editing….[I]t is an element carefully considered by set designers, cinematographers and directors, all of whom must remain sensitive to the way in which color can create meaning, mood, sensation, and perceptual cues.In this course we will examine basic color theory as it pertains to the visual arts in general and to the medium of film specifically. We will also chart the historical development of color film technology, and we will do several “case studies” of filmmakers who have arguably worked as “color theorists” themselves. These include director Douglas Sirk in collaboration with cinematographer Russell Metty (All That Heaven Allows, Written on the Wind, Imitation of Life); directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger with cinematographer Jack Cardiff (Red Shoes, Black Narcissus, A Matter of Life and Death); producer Walt Disney in collaboration with many artists such as Mary Blair and Eyvind Earle (Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty); director Alfred Hitchcock with cinematographer Robert Burks (Rear Window, North by Northwest, Vertigo, The Birds, Marnie); directors Joel and Ethan Coen with cinematographer Roger Deakins (Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou?); director Wong Kar Wai with cinematographer Christopher Doyle (Chungking Express, Ashes of Time, In the Mood for Love); director Zhang Yimou with cinematographer Christopher Doyle (Hero); and director Quentin Tarantino with cinematographer Robert Richardson (Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained).  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThe first European observers of America saw a world populated alternatively by savages or by angels, they saw peoples apparently without laws, religion, rulers, or indeed clothes. Yet much of what they saw was conditioned by what they expected to see. This course will explore the social and intellectual world(s) of those who first came to the Americas. It will follow these explorers, conquerors and chroniclers on their journeys from the Old World to the New, and will analyze not simply their impact on the New World, but how their experiences were translated into histories that fundamentally changed the way “Europeans” thought about themselves.   © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsPrerequisite: Consent of the Instructor"Fiat ars-pereat mundus, " says fascism, expecting from war, 
as Marinetti admits, the artistic gratification of a sense 
perception altered by technology. This is evidently the 
consummation of l'art pour l'art. Humankind, which once,
in Homer, was an object of contemplation for the Olympian
gods, has now become one for itself. Its self-alienation has
reached, the point where it can experience its own annihilation
as a supreme aesthetic pleasure. Such is the aestheticizing
of politics, as practiced by fascism. Communism replies by
politicizing art.̶ Walter Benjamin, “The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibilty” (Third Version, 1939)
A fascist aestheticization of politics is an ever-present
possibility of modern politics, but it is not by any means
a necessary consequence of politics being aesthetic in 
principle. If politics is also about what can appear and 
how it appears to sense, about what can be seen and heard
and what can’t be seen and heard; if it is about what we 
are able to see and hear and what we are unable to see 
and hear, then democratic politics is about letting what 
could not be seen and heard be seen and heard by cultivating new ways of seeing and hearing.̶ Nikolas Kompridis, The Aesthetic Turn in Political ThoughtIn this course we will consider the turn to aesthetics in contemporary political theory and the role of rhetoric in this turn.Required Texts:Kompridis, Nikolas, ed. The Aesthetic Turn in Political Thought.

    Felipe Gutterriez, 
  The theme of this course is the rhetoric of the legal process. As to what that might mean and what “law” might be, consider the following:Think for a moment what would follow if it were true
that the activity of law consisted of nothing more 
than memorizing certain clear rules and learning where
to find the others. First, both law school and the practice
of law would be intolerably boring. But the fact is that for
many people the study and practice of law are both 
difficult and fascinating.Let me suggest that you regard the law not as a set of rules
to be memorized but as an activity, as something that 
people do, with their minds and with each other, as they act 
in relation both to a body of authoritative legal material and 
to  the circumstances and events of the actual  world. The 
law is a set of social and intellectual practices that defines 
a universe or culture in which you will learn to function; 
like other important activities, it offers its practitioner the 
opportunity to make a life, to work out a character, for herself 
or for himself. What you will learn in law school, on this view, 
is not information in the usual sense, not a set of repeatable 
propositions, but how to do something.* * *
It might help if you were to compare the process of 
learning law *** [to] learning a language. One must of course 
know the rules of grammar and the meanings of terms, but 
to  know those things is not to know how to speak the language; 
that knowledge comes only with  use. The real difficulties and 
pleasures lie not in knowing the rules of French or of law, but 
in knowing how to speak the language, how to make sense of 
it, how to use it to serve your purposes in life.In both language and law, learning has a double focus: if one 
is to live and act competently in a particular culture, one 
simply must learn how the language-or the law-is in fact 
spoken by others, by those whom one wishes to address, 
to persuade, to learn from, and to live with. But one also 
wishes to learn how to turn the language, or the law, to one's 
own purposes: to invent new sentences, to have new ideas, 
to do new  things, perhaps to change the nature of the language 
itself. Your concern in law school is thus a double one: to learn 
as completely as you can how the legal culture functions; and 
to establish a place for yourself in relation to it from which you 
can attempt to use it in your own ways-in  ways that increase 
your capacities and powers,  ways that enable you to speak 
truthfully to the  conditions of the world and to take positions  
(and offer them to others) which seem to you to  be right. 
In doing all this you will subject your own views and inclinations 
to the discipline of the inherited culture and the conditions of 
the world; and you will have a chance, sometimes,  not only to 
maintain but to improve the culture  of which you become a part.White, James B. "Talk to Entering Students."  Occasional Papers L. Sch. U. Chi. 13 (1977): 1-6.Required Texts: Course reader available at Zee Zee Copy, 2431-C Durant Ave.Attendance: A central aspect of our study of law will the “case method” of learning law, that is,  “studying actual cases in which the law can be seen in action.” A related aspect of our study of law is the active participation required of the students. Learning law is requires your participation. You must be prepared to be called upon and to speak up in class. Attendance is therefore a requirement of this course. Students missing a class during the first two weeks will be dropped from the course.Assignments: There will be regular short written assignments, one or two longer written assignments. Students will be expected to be prepared to be called upon from time to time in class. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsWhere did the first collections originate? Why did people begin to collect? In what ways did—and do—museums and museum collections contribute to the maintenance and definition of the cultural values (and power) of elite groups? Can they also be associated with acts of resistance among marginal groups/tribes/classes. Are material objects just inanimate things or can they be considered actors in their own right? What is the relationship between collections and notions of sovereignty and/or resistance? How do we define ourselves—as citizens, as members of a discipline or tribe, as nations—with reference to collections? Who owns the objects that stand at the intersection of different nations/tribes/disciplines/practices? Why? What values/ideologies structure the debates and conflicts over definition, meaning and ownership of collections? These are some of the questions we will try to answer in this class. We will read about court spectacles and cabinets of curiosity; about the very first museums; about practices of collecting and travel; about colonial politics, world’s fairs and evolutionary theory; we will study “freaks,” circus side-shows and exotic exhibits, and we will investigate the conflicts over ownership and repatriation of artifacts and collections; finally, we will study the modern corporate imaginary of theme parks such Sea World.  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsIn this course we will examine the aesthetics and poetics of complex television narrative forms. Through in-depth analysis of the narrative, visual, and aural patterns of these forms, we will analyze the sources of our viewing pleasure as well as the ways in which complex television narratives engage with the moral, social, and ethical questions of our time. Of particular interest in this course will be the long-form storytelling series (e.g, Fargo, Mr. Robot, Stranger Things). 
Required Texts: The required texts for this course are Jason Mittel’s Complex TV: the poetics of contemporary television storytelling, and a course reader that will be available at Zee Zee copy.

  4 UnitsPopular and public discourses have long constructed varied cultural representations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation. Scientific research programs and apologetics are framed by and structured through these discourses, relating beliefs in and doubts about the sciences, offering meaning-making orientation to practitioners and concerned publics. Focusing on several cases primarily from the nineteenth century through the present, this course will examine the nature, structures and play of such scientific discourse. Examples will be drawn from past and present imaginations of scientifically and technologically enabled futures and induced catastrophes; the lure of scientific discourses and technological innovations for understanding literary and artistic endeavors; narrative underpinnings of literary and scientific texts; representations and receptions of paradigmatic scientific subjects and experiences; and relations between notions of scientific and political unity. Attention to the pervasiveness of these discourses will help us investigate the changing nature and status of the category of “science,” its limits and potentials. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThis incarnation of the seminar explores problems of knowledge, largely in the context of the development and practice of Anglo-American trial courts.  After a general introduction to the history and role of courts, which will also serve to introduce legal procedure and the fact/law distinction, we’ll turn to particular issues of evidence and testimony, paying special attention to speech and hearing.  We’ll also attend to documents and other sorts of material evidence. The aim, with regard to non-professional-law students, is to familiarize you enough with legal terms and issues that you are able to connect law, whether through history, politics, or philosophy, to  your own (social, cultural or rhetorical; disciplinary or interdisciplinary) interests.Required books are listed below (check campus library).  Required articles will be available through bCourses or the campus library. Presentations and a final paper are required.Note: This seminar on law and the problems of knowledge will be offered as a room-share with the law school’s Law 241.7 Evidence Law in Social and Historical Context. Law school instruction begins and ends one week earlier than the rest of campus.  Please contact the instructor if this is an issue.Required readings:

  4 UnitsDo men use language differently from women? What are neo-pronouns, and why has pronoun usage become so contested? Does the unity of a nation depend on a single, shared language? What happens to a culture when its language is no longer spoken? Why is it that people may feel they can identify someone’s race over the phone, without seeing the speaker? What does it mean for a person to ‘sound gay’? Do our personalities change when we speak a different language?This course will introduce students to the rhetoric of identity. In this survey of diverse languages and ways of speaking, we will examine how people use language to define, project, disguise, and complicate their identities. Case studies, research works, and personal reflections on varied aspects of identity expressed through language will bring students into contact with topics ranging from the Hindi speech of gender nonconforming Hijras to the ways of saying ‘no' in Chinese, from the break-up of the former Yugoslavia to the controversy of writing Kikuyu in post-colonial Kenya. We will critically engage with readings at the intersections of language, gender, race, nationhood, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class in pursuit of a nuanced and broadly informed view of the relationship between language and identity.
Students will also put their learning into practice through exercises in mechanics and style that will enable them to craft expository prose in a confident, authoritative, and persuasive voice. Students will respond to the readings and draw on their own experiences with language and identity in a series of written assignments, which will be revised in a collaborative framework of peer-review and discussion. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsHow does sense and sentience shape our cultural understanding? Are human senses simply innate or can they themselves be cultivated and altogether transformed by art, technology, beliefs, language, or cultural practices? In this course, we will investigate broad themes of cultural sense and sensibility in art and theories of embodiment. In this multi-sensory classroom environment, we aim to increase both textual and sensory literacy, and demonstrate our critical reading through a series of short essays and weekly writing assignments. We will read a breadth of traditional academic texts as well as visit BAMPFA and conduct close readings of artwork to practice observation and inference, and to supplement our phenomenological studies.Some critical questions we will confront in this class include:-What are the senses and how many are there? According to whom? What are the argumentative means that various writers use to identify the senses and how might these means restrict or enable their definition or even their abilities?-Do media and sensual objects like film or MSG correspond only to particular organs like the eye and tongue, or do they direct themselves to an integrated sensorium? How do media or sensual objects habituate the senses and therefore educate us or produce certain subjectivities and dispositions through their formal qualities and affordances?-What are the senses across different socio-historical, cultural, and material contexts, and why might they be construed in the way that they are?-If each sense is characteristically different, what specifically can be learned from each? Does sensory knowledge carry over into other forms of thought and if so in what ways?-What is the role of both notation and representation in sensing the world?Readings include short textual selections from Leonado Da Vinci, René Descartes, Friedrich von Schiller, Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Henri Bergson, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Georg Simmel, Pierre Bourdieu, Yuasa Yasuo, J. J. Gibson, Constance Classen, Jonathan Crary, Svetlana Alpers, Arindum Dutta, Daniel HellerRoazen, David Howes, and Jacques Rancière. Contemporary artworks include selections from Meret Oppenheim, Mona Hatoum, Lorna Simpson, Christian Marclay, Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik, Joseph Kosuth, Anish Kapoor, Nikki S.

  4 UnitsOn the evening of July 7th, 2016, hundreds of Bay Area citizens walked into oncoming traffic on Highway 880 in order to protest the recent killings of African American men by police officers. This was not the first attempt by protesters to shut down a major transit site responding to police killing; in 2014, protesters rendered an Oakland BART station non-operational by, once again, using human bodies to impede the follow of traffic. One way to think about these recent protests is as embodied disruptions to habitual, daily living. And yet the extent and effectiveness of these disruptions outside their immediate communities remains open for debate, as months after these demonstrations, Trump won the projected Electoral College vote.As this is an R1A course, our emphasis is writing. Students will write a series of critical analysis papers contextualizing, situating, and responding to key theoretical texts. Drawing on the work of scholars such as Alexander Weheliye, Zizi Papacharissi, Catharine Malabou, and Bernard Stiegler, we will consider the philosophical commitments entailed by such activist positions advanced by Black Lives Matters, the Arab Spring, and Occupy—as well other artists, hacktivists, and theorists—about the construction, plasticity, and relation among individuals, collectivity, and technology, but first, we will survey the role of embodiment in contemporary modes of protests through a series of case studies.  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsWhen does a rebel or writer become a hero, or an uprising or aesthetic become a social movement? Why are some revolutionaries fanatics, and others dreamers? Why are some movements successful, while others fail? Are social movements undemocratic or necessary for democracy? Are they always utopic? 
This course examines rhetoric within and around social movements. We will interrogate the boundaries and characteristics of these movements through intellectual, aesthetic, physical, spiritual, and political frames, examining films in addition to theoretical, literary, and historical texts. We will discuss "movements" as diverse as Ayotzinapa, Berkeley Free Speech Movement, #BlackLivesMatter, Black Panthers, Colonize Outer Space, Daesh, Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, Idle No More, and the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. 
To engage students’ individual commitments, each student will choose two social movements to study for two research projects. Assignments and in-class work aim to develop analytical techniques such as textual analysis, argument construction, and bringing multiple texts into conversation. In accordance with the University of California’s Reading and Composition (R&C) 1B requirement, this course offers rigorous training in analytical reading, thinking, writing, and research. It will reinforce skills from the 1A and introduce research methodologies, preparing students for successful academic careers across disciplines while presenting approaches from the field of rhetoric. To conclude the semester, students will produce a 10-12 page research paper in lieu of a final exam. Students will also give two presentations: one on an assigned text, the other on the rhetoric of a contemporary movement.   © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThe Ancient Greeks are a rich source of war-related poetry, drama, and historical information, and are often invoked in contemporary settings as a source of “timeless” insights. This course explores ancient Greek attitudes towards war in epic poems, theater, history, and philosophy, and critically examines contemporary renderings and reconfigurations of Greek stories and ideas. We’ll begin by considering the Greeks in their own context, investigating their rhetoric and rationales for and against war; war’s myriad political, social, and personal effects; its mythic and heroic dimensions; and Greek representations of gender and power. We will also consider the ways in which genre or form—such as epic, or tragedy, or philosophical argument—can influence the content, allowing different kinds of ideas about war to be expressed.  We’ll then turn to contemporary adaptations of ancient Greek myths, and examine which insights contemporary authors attribute to the ancients. We will ask how these texts are translated, not only across language, but also across cultures and historical periods.As this is an R1B course, we will focus on the skills required to develop research papers, including close reading, critical analysis, and developing an effective structure and style for an argumentative essay through a process of writing and revision. Students will produce a 10-12 page research paper as their final project.Readings will include excerpts from Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Euripides, Aeschylus, and Aristophanes; and contemporary renderings by Doerries, Weil, Shay, Oswald, Scarry, Logue, Slatkin, and McLaughlin.  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsIn this course we will develop research and argumentative skills through exploring theoretical and imaginative texts that revolve around technology, science and social order. In one part of the class we will build on the skills already acquired in the R1A course and introduce new skills for conducting research, evaluating and engaging with outside sources, and composing progressively longer papers that cite those sources.In the other part, we will read and discuss texts that take up the questions of artificial intelligence and human attachment (Ex-Machina), the relation between justice and techniques of scientific prediction (Foundation, Minority Report), and time travel (The Time Machine) among others. We will watch several contemporary films and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on sci-fi and utopian/distopian fiction. The following questions will underlie a few of our discussions: can humans attach to inanimate machines and, if so, what do such attachments teach us about human-to-human relationships? Why are we both fascinated by and deeply anxious about the possibility of artificial intelligence such as that possessed by cyborgs and robots? Why are science and scientific innovation used as models to imagine perfect societies and why do such models usually fail? How do sci-fi texts encode implicit utopian wishes and why is the genre a fruitful site for such social thinking?Writing assignments will include short in-class writing exercises, peer-review, a midterm paper and 10-page final paper. The midterm and the final papers will include a research component for which students will need to independently consult and engage with secondary materials outside of the course reader.   © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThis course explores scholarly engagements with the "lost" histories of colonized, enslaved, and other subaltern groups. It asks how scholars can differently re-write colonial metanarratives of the past and, in doing so, reframe politics of the present with future implications. We will examine colonial literature, from empire to liberation movements, particularly post-World War II Africa leading up to 1960 and later freedom struggles in post-apartheid South Africa and the Greenbelt Movement of Kenya. We will investigate the impact of fiction and non-fiction on the construction of social and political landscapes.

Within the limits of this region and time frame, students will write their own 10-12 page research paper as a final project, using Western and non-Western archives, documents, and artifacts from the course.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsOften we think of the everyday as the unremarkable register of our experience. In this course, however, we will invite you to attend to everyday experience as a significant rhetorical site, where complex meanings are dynamically produced, resisted, and transformed.At the outset of our course, we will inquire into the nature of everyday experience and ask how it might be constituted and registered in language, sign, image, body, and place. What creative dimensions inhabit everyday experience? Are they visible or touchable? Can we see them or speak (to) them? Do they leave any traces? If so, what are these traces and where (and when) can they be found? With these queries, we aim to critique, commune with and derange the multiple forms taken by the concept of the everyday.As we continue to seek out the everyday, we will also ask how we ourselves are articulated, shaped and transformed through our own quotidian experiences. How do the words, images and spaces we inhabit--and the motions we perform--constitute and shape our own selves? We will also consider how the everyday is at once the site of the banal and the place where we find ourselves faced with the uncanny and the absolutely strange. What is the life of an ordinary word? What of a photograph or advertisement? How can we think of resistance in relation to “everyday” objects? We will think through the iterations of the everyday in text, image and embodied space, engaging with works by thinkers and artists such as Roland Barthes, Judith Butler, Michel de Certeau, bell hooks, Clarice Lispector, Ana Mendieta, Trinh Minh-ha and others.This course fulfills the second half of the Reading and Composition (R&C) requirement at UC Berkeley. We will seek to develop the critical tools required of writers and readers at the college level by establishing strategies for close reading, argument building, the use of textual evidence, and academic research. Students will use these tools to produce a 10-12 page research paper as their final project. Also, we will provide some introduction to the discipline of rhetoric and the modes of inquiry active in the Rhetoric Department at UC Berkeley.   © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThe purpose of this course to build upon the critical thinking, reading, and writing skills learned in R1A and to develop students’ fluency writing longer and more complex papers.  This is a writing-intensive course.  The goal is for each student to experience how writing extends thought and to better learn how to discern the thought behind written rhetorical texts.  One of the central emphases in this course is the frequent practice of reading, writing, re-writing, and re-reading.  Students will be exposed to a range of different source materials and will be directed on how to effectively incorporate sources into their writing.  Additionally, much attention will be given to the development of research skills, work-shopping student writing, and revision.  By the end of the term, students should be proficient in the fundamentals of writing a research paper.
In this course, we will examine what American rhetoric concerning nation and identity reveals about race and its role in American social life.  This course approaches rhetoric as a practice that is always linked to the social ordering of society.  From the Founding Fathers to present day political and cultural rhetoric, the subject of race is addressed with language that is noticeably evasive, awkward, erratic, and unfounded.  Our analysis of declarations, speeches, histories, and criticism on national identity will elucidate the hierarchies and tensions that have persisted, even as American society has changed.  We will consider questions such as: what kinds of problems does  race create in rhetoric about American national identity?  Also, what can a study of rhetoric teach us about the roots of America’s peculiar problem with race?  What can such a study teach us about how to address this problem effectively?    © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThis course will examine influential conceptions of human reasoning in the modern period. We will pay particular attention to the way that reasoning has been linked with language, with the understanding of the nervous system, and with new technological developments (especially computing). Our focus will be on the tension between reason as “critique” and reason as one of many different ways human beings produce meaning in their world.The seminar will start with iconic starting points in the Enlightenment and nineteenth century – Rousseau, Kant, and Hegel, before tracking a line of thought that will include pragmatism (Peirce and James), psychoanalysis (Freud), Continental philosophy (Heidegger), critical theory (Horkheimer and Adorno, Arendt), cybernetics and AI (Turing, Newell and Simon, Hofstadter, ), psychology and cognitive science, poststructuralism (Derrida), and we will conclude with contemporary efforts to rethink human reason within biology and technology (Malabou, Latour, Stiegler).

Since this course is primarily concerned with the status of the human body in an age of intensive technological intervention, we will pay close attention to dance and movement art, asking, what is it about bodily movement and presence that escapes or exceeds scriptural notation?   This course is approved for the "History and Theory" concentration.   © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThis course insists that we should argue. Moreover, it contends that every interaction between people is a confrontation, from the small talk at the drugstore to televised political debates. We will, first, seek to understand how arguments are traditionally understood and why it behooves us to learn to speak and listen in such a fashion. Thereafter, we will question a tradition of cooperation and ask if, indeed, a peaceful silence befits everyone. Our third concern—which voices are silenced and which bodies are subdued—will lead us to our fourth: how our simple, everyday decisions and preferences constitute a confrontation. In fact, as we may ultimately see, to be alive is to argue.In class, we will consider a variety of critical readings, live and online speech performances, and in-class performances and discussions of argumentation. As a class, we will dwell for 6 weeks on questions such as:Why should we argue and how ought we do it?
What is rhetoric? And what does it matter who sees and hears us?
Will we have peace and quiet in the end?
Can’t we all just get along?
How is confrontation necessary for harmony in discord?This course not only serves to introduce students to theories of modern argumentation and political reason; it functions as an introductory public speaking course. The first half of the course (i.e., weeks 1-3) exposes students to classical rhetorical theory and its 21st-century translation into public speaking books and manuals. The second half (i.e., weeks 4-6) leverages critical and cultural theory to complicate traditional understandings of concepts like persuasion, identification, argumentation, and charisma. Throughout the six weeks, students will negotiate and experiment within the practical and theoretical dimensions of public speaking. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsOf what does "Greenness" consist? In what does "Greenness" abide? Just what is "Greenness" good for? In this course we will survey a range of key vocabularies of environmental thought and activism -- Deep Ecology, eco-socialism, eco-feminism, environmental justice, anti-civilizationism, permaculture, sustainable development, disaster capitalism, and futurological geo-engineering -- as well as engage with more specifically and indicatively American traditions, from Transcendentalism to wilderness conservation (or exterminism), the land ethic, and consumer lifestyle ecology. We will also delve into what seem to be prevalent rhetorical strategies to communicate the urgency of environmental crises and mobilize sufficient constituencies to address them. What is compelling or not about current forms of environmental journalism? What delights lie in store for the reader of international agreements on climate change and policy papers available from the Environmental Protection Agency? Does the scientificity of statistics lend force to environmental claims or alienate people from narratives of lived distress and shared threat? If liberal governance is inadequate to address environmental catastrophe are efforts to circumvent the political via macro-design strategies or micro-mindfulness lifeways more likely to succeed? Does the proliferation of environmentalist identities and subcultures facilitate necessary political organization or undermine it or simply reveal its ineradicable intersectional stratification? We will even ponder why so many environmentalist websites make recourse to similar color palettes and fonts and images. Our focus will never drift far from current dilemmas, but the premise of the course is that these dilemmas are illuminated by critical vocabularies just as the critical vocabularies are substantiated by the dilemmas to which they are applied. At the end of the term, each student will create a conceptual-keyword map tracing their own course through the course materials and finding their own settlement within them, however unsettling it may be.The course reader will contain selections from Carol Adams, Wendell Barry, Robert Bullard, Rachel Carson, Greta Gaard, Donna Haraway, Wes Jackson, Naomi Klein, Joel Kovel, Aldo Leopold, Bill McKibben, Chico Mendes, Timothy Morton, Arne Naess, Rob Nixon, Vandana Shiva, Anna Tsing, many others….  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsHow did the promise of peer-to-peer participatory democracy devolve into twitter harassment, doxxing, toxic comment sections, and zero comments? Is techno-progressive "disruption" merely reactionary deregulation, venture capitalist "innovation" merely marketing hyperbole, futurological "acceleration" merely social precarization, tech's vaunted "sharing economy" merely a digital sharecropping society, its "openness" vacuity, its "participation" another form of television? How did early legal and political squabbles over privacy and property online set the stage for our current distress? How might the "end-to-end principle" defining internet architecture across its many layers comport with the ideologically reactionary figure of "negative liberty" playing out in generations of anarchic, spontaneist, populist online activism? What are the politics of a digitality figured as an immaterial spirit realm, when digital networks abet financial fraud and military surveillance via an "internet" powered by coal smoke, accessed on toxic landfill-destined devices manufactured by wage slaves in overexploited regions of the real world? Setting aside the logical possibility and engineering plausibility of "artificial intelligence" does AI as a rhetorical trope in legal and cultural discourse facilitate and rationalize unaccountable algorithmic mediation and muddy our thinking about "autonomous" weapons systems? How does social media facilitate the transformation of factual disputes over climate change, harm reduction, and the macroeconomics of public investment into polarizing culture wars? Are there appropriate and appropriable techniques at hand through which democratizations might resist these degradations? Might "The Future" still be more evenly distributed? Can we still count on the street finding its own uses for things?We will be reading critics, philosophers, and legal scholars who ask (and sometimes answer) these and other questions about the democratizing and anti-democratizing vicissitudes of what has passed for "technological change" especially in and for the US in recent years: Hannah Arendt, Paulina Borsook, David Golumbia, Katherine Hayles, Lawrence Lessig, Evgeny Morozov, Frank Pasquale, Audrey Watters. We will also be laughing (if ruefully) at plenty of loose but lucrative talk by digi-utopians and techno-boosters.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 Units In Technopoly, Neil Postman advances a perilous vision of American culture, which, he argues, has surrendered to digital technology. He configures a relationship between humans and technology in terms of power, coercion, and utility, where, in his words, we become the “tools of our tools.” We may think that we simply use technology, but Postman suggests the opposite occurs: technology uses its user.
One might situate Postman’s view alongside the emergence of cybernetics as a field of inquiry in the late 1940s and, decades later, through Web 3.0 culture, where the study of the control and flow of information becomes synonymous with tracking, aggregating, and directing human behavior. For media theorist N. Katherine Hayles, the rise of digital/cybernetic culture seeks to separate mental activity from its body by reducing humans to streams of data. This disembodiment, she argues, redefines what it means to be human by exchanging Enlightenment metaphors of a self-determined, logically-determined Man motivated by rational self-interest for the reticulated metaphors associated with digital technology – a networked and hackable body of human data packets loosely gathered under the term “posthuman.”
Of course, Postman and Hayles’ positions may drift toward dystopic – perhaps even technophobic  -- visions of digital technology that do not account for the entire field of media studies. But their arguments do reveal how digital technology might possibly unsettle staid assumptions about what it means to be human in a digital milieu and, more specifically, how digital technology may reconfigure notions of memory, identity, and subjectivity. In addition to questions raised by Postman and Hayles, we will engage a particular line of inquiry that explores key boundaries -- between technology and humans, bots and bodies, algorithms and aesthetics -- through conceptual, lyric, and collaborative poetry. We will consider the following questions:As a class, we will address these questions not by seeking definitions of poetry and technology (though these may emerge from our projects), but by considering how each emerges as distinct from the other. We will follow these lines of inquiry through our own writing in two ways: first, by exploring works by contemporary new media artists and postwar American poets whose poems engage early cybernetic culture and, secondly, by conversing with new media critics and scholars contemplating the philosophy of technology and aesthetics.
 As this is an R1A course, our focus is the craft of critical writing. You will be asked to engage, critique, and/or extend the work of prominent scholars, artists, and activists featured in the syllabus through a series of critical writing assignments that address the aforementioned questions. Critical writing is a practice that requires revision (as re-visioning); we will encourage this process by inviting you to edit and enhance at least 3 essays over the course of the semester based upon your reflections, peer review, and instructor feedback. © UC Regents 2014.

Consider the tick. Its perceptual organs can detect the odor of butyric acid emitted by the follicles of mammals, triggering a response that awakens it from its slumber and signals it to drop onto its future host. The tick "knows" how to navigate its way through fur to warm skin, where it can feed and continue its reproductive cycle. How is the tick's world composed? And in distinction to the world of the tick, how is the world of "the human" composed and ordered? Humans are thought to have developed a distinctive capacity "to know" the world, in part through "science" and its evolving repertoire of techniques and technologies. What is this "knowledge"? Who has the authority required to maintain and control knowledge, and why? How do science, scientific practice, and technologies rearticulate not just our relation to the world but the composition of the world itself? And how can these questions inform the way in which we compose and organize our writing? © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 Units Enlisting Franz Kafka’s parable “Before the Law” as a locus of inspiration and point of departure, this writing course seeks to explore how indigenous political identity stands “before” the law in two important ways: First, indigenous polities are perceived as topographically outside and temporally prior to the legal and political order of the settler colonial nation state. And second, these polities are subjected to, coerced by, and impelled to appear before domestic courts of law and within international legal apparatuses for the purposes of testimony, judgment, and redress. Using a variety of literary, philosophical, anthropological, and legal texts, students will be encouraged to think with, write about, and critically examine broad and multifaceted concepts like “culture” “indigeneity” “law” and “recognition” as they relate to contemporary indigenous struggles for land, political self-determination, and human rights. Special emphasis will be given to exploring how language-based theories of culture work to both enable and constrain indigenous (self)representation, political legibility, and legal subjectivity. Over the course of the semester, formal written assignments and informal classroom exercises will be used to target and improve skills of textual analysis, critical thought, argumentative writing, and research proficiency. Students will develop strategies for analyzing and synthesizing complex arguments across different disciplines, styles, and contexts, while constructing and supporting their own original argumentative claims through the use of research and properly cited textual evidence. A ten page research paper serves as the final project. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsAs Merleau-Ponty claims in The Visible and the Invisible, “the flesh is at the heart of the world.” In this course, we will consider the centrality of the body alongside our increasingly mechanized world. In service of this task, we will look to a range of philosophical texts—from Merleau-Ponty to Heidegger to Deleuze—in order to ask how new technical developments shape and impact our embodied, worldly interactions. Further, we will look critically at the instrumentalization of technology as a means of control or oppression by organizations of power. We will ground this work in historical and political examples while developing a language and a theoretical framework for expressing how the proliferation of technology changes our world, while also examining the embodied and intersubjective ways through which we experience this world. The course will conclude with readings concerning our current political atmosphere and the contemporary deployment of technology, so that we may ask how, in light of our previous theoretical work, one considers embodiment in an age of information and algorithms.In accordance with the Reading and Composition (R&C) 1B requirement, we will focus on developing rigorous reading, writing and research skills, building from those established in the 1A. As this is the second course in the Reading and Composition series, the syllabus also places an emphasis on the acquisition of the skills required for researching and writing a successful 10-12 page undergraduate term paper. Three modules will guide us through the process of turning a vaguely defined research topic into a well-researched argument about a topic. In addition to building the methodological, organizational, and literary capabilities required for composing a research paper, we will develop the following skills: How do we find sources that help us see beyond readily-available, common sense knowledge? How might the study of theoretical and philosophical texts allow us to work through political and cultural concerns?  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsReason has often been one of the defining features of what it means to be a human, as opposed to a mere animal. This class will explore the nature of human reasoning and the historical forms it has taken in the modern era. We will begin with the very origin of humanity itself – with the emergence of “homo sapiens” – then discuss some important attempts to explain (and sometimes systematize) the work of reason. We will read philosophers, psychologists, writers, and engineers, including texts by, for example, Descartes, Hobbes, Peirce, Poe, Turing, and Kuhn. The final part of the class will focus on the problem of reason in the digital age. What is the future of reason (and especially human reason) in the age of artificial intelligence and machine learning? © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsIn the days before tweets and sound bites, there was the sound of the voice, pure and simple. Ancient Greece and Rome were oral cultures: the spoken word was the primary means of communication, and even books were made to be read aloud rather than silently and in private. To understand rhetoric, the theory and practice of speaking, was to understand human behavior. To control it was to control human behavior. To use it was to enter into a community of speakers and to cultivate communal values, whether through agreement or disagreement. Thus, the art of rhetoric was at once a powerful tool and a threat. As a result, rhetoric could be respected, feared, and disparaged.
This course will offer an overview of the shifting attitudes to the powers and limits of rhetoric in antiquity, while keeping one eye on the question, What value does rhetoric have for us today? The readings will progress historically, starting with Homer, the first theorist and practitioner of rhetoric, then turning to the Golden Age of rhetoric in fifth- and fourth-century Athens (Thucydides, Euripides, the sophists, Plato, Aristotle, the orators, the Cynics), then to Republican and imperial Rome (Cicero, Tacitus, Longinus, Dio Chrysostom, Lucian), and ending in late antiquity (Augustine and the development of Christian rhetoric). Brief secondary readings in Classics and in more contemporary theory (Auerbach, Arendt, Derrida, and Foucault) will supplement the primary texts.
Requirements: attendance/participation in lectures and sections, short writing assignments (blogposts), midterm, final essay (ca. 5 pages).  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

    James I.  Porter, 
  4 UnitsParticipants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer (the Iliad and Odyssey); and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed (adapted, used, quoted, sometimes maligned and abused, sometimes creatively reshuffled, translated into different media—first writing, then sculpture, painting, poetry, cinema—or transposed into geographical and archaeological inquiries) while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today. And because this tradition has had to invent its source (Homer, whose identity is utterly mysterious and may turn out to be an idea, not a person), the tradition is literally eccentric in all of its manifestations: at its center stands an absent and empty name (“Homer”) and an unanswerable question (“Who was Homer?”). Wrestling with these dilemmas has long been a productive way to generate new cultural forms and especially new “untimely” critiques of the often violent but ever alluring foundations of our culture. This process is still alive today.

Readings in the first half of the term will cover antiquity: the archaeology of Troy, the history of the Trojan War, the Homeric poems (read selectively), and ancient critiques or revisions of Homer (Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Gorgias, Plato, Aristotle, Isocrates, Longinus, Dio Chrysostom). The second half will cover selected modern counterparts, above all philosophers, cultural critics, and poets: Vico, Hegel, Nietzsche, Horkheimer and Adorno, Auerbach, Simone Weil, Rachel Bespaloff, Derek Walcott, Christopher Logue, and Kate Tempest. Secondary readings, providing background and context, will accompany the primary materials.

Requirements: two in-class presentations, a take-home midterm (essay format), and a final paper (ca. 8-10 pp.), to be presented in draft during the last week of class. Please visit the bCourses course site for updates and for readings as they become available.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 Units“Examination of philosophical dialogues from Plato to Heidegger. Focus on the interaction within the dialogue, the participation required of the reader/listener, and the relation of such interaction and participation to thinking, speaking and knowing.”In this twice-weekly seminar, we will read and discuss some dialogical works by great philosophers concerned with language and knowledge. The substantive focus of the dialogues will be on law or practical knowledge or on knowing what to do. In addition to reading some philosophical dialogues, we will consider some of the ways in which dialogue and exchange is constrained in contemporary law.   Through close readings of quite difficult texts and hokey in-class exercises and exchanges, we will consider what makes a dialogue something other than a monologue or a monograph, what sorts of interactions occur in dialogue, and how participation and performance in dialogue relates to reading, writing, speaking, knowing and judging.Required texts will include Plato, Cicero, Augustine, Hobbes, J.L. Austin, Quinn, and some contemporary works. At least two pages of writing will be required every other week.Enrollment:   attendance is required.  Students who attend but are not enrolled will be given precedence over students who enroll but do not attend for the first two weeks. **** This course counts for either the History & Theory or Public Discourse Concentration. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsDirector Alfred Hitchcock's reliance on literary works is a lesser-known factor in his filmmaking, in part because of Hitchcock's famous “authorship” of his films, which he forcefully publicized. Yet Hitchcock was a frequent adapter of acclaimed novels such as Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train, Robert Bloch's Psycho, Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca and Jamaica Inn, Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (filmed as Sabotage) and Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac's D'entre Les Morts (Between Deaths, filmed as Vertigo). He also relied on adaptations of short stories such as Daphne du Maurier's “The Birds” and Cornell Woolrich's “It Had to Be Murder” (filmed as Rear Window), and even on one occasion a journalist’s news story for Life Magazine: Henry Brean’s “A Case of Identity” (filmed as The Wrong Man). Hitchcock's collaborations with screenwriters favored free and idiosyncratic interpretations of literary text sources. His intense unhappiness with the “faithful” adaptation process forced upon him in bringing Daphne du Maurier's bestseller Rebecca to the screen, thus preventing it from becoming “a real Hitchcock film” in the director's view, has been compellingly analyzed by Tania Modleski in The Women Who Knew Too Much. 

In this course we will examine Hitchcock's films in terms of adaptation, in an attempt to re-establish the connection between his famous filmic “authorship” and the obscured literary authorship that preceded it.  © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

    Eileen Jones, 
  4 Units According to James Naremore in his seminal book Acting in the Cinema,...[P]eople in film can be regarded in at least three different senses: as actors playing theatrical personages, as public figures playing themselves, and as documentary evidence. If the term performance is defined in its broadest sense, it covers the last category as much as the first: when people are caught unawares by a camera, they become objects to be looked at, and they usually provide evidence of role-playing in everyday life; when they know they are being photographed, they become role-players of another sort.In contrast, critic David Thomson argues, “'Actor' is not even a term appropriate to the cinema. The barrier of the screen certainly gives the impression of acting, but what we are seeing in the cinema are people.”In this course we will explore film performance in the complex terms laid out by Naremore, Thompson, Andrew Klevan, Cynthia Baron and Sharon Marie Carnicke, and many others, considering such issues as:•	the effect of cinema on performance basics such as expression, gesture, speech, and movement; 
•	acting methods (Delsarte, Stanislavsky, Brecht); 
•	stardom, casting, and typecasting in film; 
•	character actors
•	the film performer's relationship to clothing, make-up, and props, as well as the camera, mise-en-scene, lighting, editing, and other performers; 
•	and the way performance is inflected by genre and directorial vision. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

  4 UnitsThis course meets the public discourse requirement in the Department of Rhetoric. Through the examination of various media, from texts to film, and audio media, we will explore the connection of narrative to discourse in American culture. We will start with the question of what is American popular culture, and whether there is a discernable cultural identity in our society. If so, is there a connection to the issue of race in American history that is deeply imbedded in our cultural identity? © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsThis course will explore how the political and legal emphasis on decision as a mark of sovereignty has been threatened, rejected, and reimagined over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as political institutions have become more reliant on bureaucratic networks and, increasingly, on technological systems for administering political communities. And given the importance of war and emergency in conceptualizations of sovereignty, the emergence of technologized and even automated battlefields has put pressure on traditional notions of executive power. We will begin by surveying some recent literature that highlights how forms of sovereignty has been eroded or corrupted by technical automation in the digital age. We will then return to one of the more influential formulations of sovereignty in the interwar period, the work of Carl Schmitt, before delving into the problem of technology in his own writing. Next, we will look at how the rise of computer technology and cybernetics during and immediately after the Second World War influenced political theory in a new global configuration of power. Finally, we will conclude with an analysis of the political dimension of recent theorizations of technology.Readings from: Schmitt, Concept of the Political, Political Theology, Leviathan in the State Theory of Hobbes, Nomos of the Earth, Dialogues on Power; Deutsch, Nerves of Government; Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus; Stiegler, States of Shock; Massumi, Ontopower; Bratton, The Stack.

  4 UnitsThis course is an introduction to law and jurisprudence. A non-exhaustive list of the themes that it will address is: Law and Society, Freedom and Necessity, The Reach of the Law, The Legal and the Non-Legal, Law and Morality.
An assumption of this course is that jurisprudential issues arise in the context of concrete legal conflicts, and that the reading of actual cases often offers more interesting classroom discussion than reading theories about the principles that the cases are believed to illustrate. Accordingly, although the readings will include theoretical material, the course focus will on the reading and analysis of the jurisprudential issues revealed through a reading of caselaw. We may also consider questions of legal philosophy through the screening of several films.Required Textbook(s):

  4 UnitsThis course in advanced topics in law, philosophy, and rhetoric proceeds as a philosophical seminar inquiring, this term, into the language of law by way of inquiry into the law of language.Exploring the history of philosophical concern with language, we shall consider classic and contemporary philosophical accounts of language’s nature, ground, and purpose, seen in its relation to truth, meaning, speech, reference, and communication:  How are language, and human being in relation to it, already taken to be, such that language is theorized and accounted for in just these ways?  Throughout, we shall be concerned to keep the question before us, as a genuine one:  What is language?At the same time we shall be asking:  What is it that guides and governs language?  How is it that logic, grammar, practice, and efficacy come to appear as ruling and governing language, and us in our relation to it?   What are language and human being already taken to be, such that language takes its governance there — and what is language, such that it is, or is taken to be, available to and in need of such governance?  What is the law of language?We shall thereby be brought to consider what governance itself is and may be, and so to the enduring question of the philosophy of law:  What is law?Inquiring into the law of language we thus come to engage the philosophy of language and of law, encountering law and language as questions and contemplating our relation to and involvement in each.Prior exposure to philosophy is not required; an openness to its challenges is.Please note:  All students interested in taking this class — whether pre-enrolled, wait-listed, or neither — are to attend the first class meeting, 2-5 p.m. on Tuesday, August 29 in Room 242, Hearst Gym.In planning their schedules, students should be aware that wide-ranging collective discussions, often lasting an hour or more, will generally occur during office hours to be announced.  In past classes, students have found these informal but intense discussions to be of substantial help in coming to terms with difficult material encountered in the course.  Students are strongly encouraged to attend these sessions.

  4 UnitsTaking examples from film, video, and the visual arts with writings by poets, cultural critics and philosophers, the course will focus on “voice” as an activity by which the text’s social, ethic and esthetic positioning is conveyed to the viewer.  It will explore the intervals between saying and seeing, speaking and hearing, or between language and image, sense and sound. Of importance, for example, is the compass of the voice and the way its presence and absence physically and conceptually structures the filmic space. Attention will thus be given to practices that question the conventions by which image, music and verbal text are constituted as a homogenous whole (the many-as-one fiction), and that challenge the perpetration of relations of subordination between plastic representation and linguistic reference—or, the tendency to fold the space of verbal language over that of visual language (and vice-versa) and hence to reduce them to the functions of illustrating, explaining and duplicating.  © UC Regents 2014.

  4 Units This seminar series offers critical reflections about the philosophical, aesthetic and political consequences of the increasing dominance of automated systems in contemporary culture. In particular, it is set to explore the tension between computation and philosophy, ratio and logic, measure and metaphysics as a central to our understanding of technology today. It will explore the tension between cybernetics as the efficient machine of reasoning and metaphysics as the model of theoretical thinking. By engaging with critical and post-critical approaches to the role of the machine (medium and instrument) in Western culture, the seminars will discuss the ontological possibilities stemming from the alliance between gender and automation, race and techne, and other alien figurations of subjectivity. © UC Regents 2014.

  4 UnitsIn this course we will examine the theories of mass society and popular culture that have emerged amid the complex social, cultural, economic, and industrial transformations of society that have occurred since the late 19th century. We will examine these theories as responses to the classic "problems" of mass culture, modern society as the site of emancipation or alienation, the role of theory as symptom or therapy, sources of social solidarity in a modern society, and the interplay between heterogeneity/homogeneity, unconscious/hyperconscious, and depth/surface that characterizes contemporary society.The readings in this course consist of the work of a number of social and cultural theorists. I plan to make their theories more accessible through our collective consideration of a variety of cultural artifacts. To do well in this course you will have to read a lot of material carefully, be prepared to participate in class discussion, and be willing to work together on class presentations.Required Textbook(s):

     This course will examine different attempts to conceive, construct and enact sciences of the social world, examining their transformations, ruptures, and shifts primarily from the early nineteenth century to the present. These attempts are part of ongoing efforts to posit and apply notions of social justice and welfare, enactments that also provoke critiques challenging the wisdom and probity of their visions and practices. In turn, such pursuits have been stitched into the problematics of disciplinary traditions in science and technology studies, and in history, philosophy and sociopolitical orders. The course will return to literatures on the histories of race and science (eugenics, early statistics, anthropology), connecting them, for example, to economic literatures on wealth and development, as well as to a variety of science studies relating to practices of mapping and municipal planning in different contexts. Through such connections, this course overviews and probes relevant theoretical interventions and debates in these overlapping disciplines.   © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

   This course is for students selected as writing tutors for the new Art of Writing Departmental
Tutoring Program. Undergraduates with proven writing skills will work with students taking R&C in
the departments of Comparative Literature, English, Film and Media, and Rhetoric in one-on- one
tutoring sessions. They will be trained by experienced GSIs to provide targeted and disciplinary-
specific writing help that responds to the parameters of R&C instruction and the challenges faced by
R&C student writers in each department.
Students who elect to take this course for one unit will be expected to hold three hours of by-
appointment and drop-in tutoring sessions each week; students receiving two units will provide six
hours of tutoring per week. Tutors are expected to commit to a consistent weekly tutoring schedule,
which will be determined in coordination with the Program Coordinator, and to submit regular
written reports on all tutoring sessions. In addition to their tutoring work, all writing tutors will be
required to attend one extended training session at the beginning of the semester and regular hour-
long tutor workshops (approximately every other week) throughout the semester. © UC Regents 2014. All Rights Reserved

         The Department of Rhetoric graduate program provides professional training in academic research and teaching, culminating in the PhD degree. We do not offer a MA program. Our faculty represents a diverse range of scholarly expertise dedicated to the discipline of rhetoric, which is theoretically informed and interdisciplinary in practice, focused on discourse analysis, broadly conceived. We welcome students of all disciplinary knowledge and methodological training, including those with portfolios in the arts; however, we rank highly those applicants whose records of academic and related achievement demonstrate potential for success as scholar-teachers at the PhD level. We prefer students who at the time of application are able to 1) identify a general area of inquiry and, if possible, a specific research object or objects, and 2) explain why this study would best be done in the Department of Rhetoric at Berkeley, and not in a more traditional disciplinary or departmental academic unit at Berkeley, or some other institution. The Department recognizes that for the graduate student, the  educational and financial benefits of teaching eventually are offset by  its time  demands. Students therefore are encouraged to actively seek out and  apply for university and outside sources of financial aid, especially for the semesters immediately following the qualifying exam.Please contact Mr. Marcus Norman, the Graduate Student Affairs Officer for the Department of Rhetoric, at mdn@berkeley.eduYou may contact Professor Michael Mascuch, who is Faculty Head Graduate Student Adviser for the Department of Rhetoric, at mascuch@berkeley.eduThe profiles, research interests, and contact information of our faculty are available on the website, under People. We invite you to study their biographies and descriptions of current research, and to email those whose interests are closest to yours, should you have specific questions.Visits to classes are at the discretion of the instructor; prospective guests may contact a professor directly about the possibility of visiting his or her course.  Our course schedule is posted on the department website, and is available through the U.C. Berkeley campus’s online schedule of classes. The profiles and research interests of our current graduate students are posted on our department website, along with their emails. No, the Rhetoric Department does not offer a MA program.No, only a BA or its equivalent is required.  The Department of Rhetoric admits many students with merely the BA degree.  Others may have a MFA or a MA, in addition to the BA.  Rhetoric graduate students begin their studies at the same point, regardless of prior graduate experience.No, it cannot.  The Rhetoric PhD program advances students to candidacy for the PhD degree through a course of study designed to prepare them to write a dissertation in Rhetoric.  Other MA degree programs, even ones in rhetoric departments, cannot replicate this unique preparation.Students at Berkeley Law can undertake a concurrent JD with various kinds of Masters degrees, but not a concurrent JD/PHD unless it is with JSP.Rhetoric PhDs typically participate in the following DE programs: Critical Theory, Film Studies, Women, Gender & Sexuality, Folklore, and Early Modern Studies. Candidates for the PhD are required to demonstrate competence in two foreign languages.Seminar experiences outside of the department are essential to the Rhetoric doctoral program at Berkeley. While the first year is largely devoted to Rhetoric program requirements in Ancient and Contemporary Rhetoric (200 and 205) and a four other seminars in Rhetoric, the rest of a student’s coursework is carefully selected from an array of courses offered on the Berkeley campus. Because students take courses on campus for the first three years and teach regularly in the program, it is not possible to pursue our doctoral program on a commuter basis. In the summers and in the fourth or fifth years, students whose research requires national or international travel are certainly allowed to relocate for an appropriate period of time. © UC Regents 2014.

        The Department recognizes that for the graduate student, the  educational  and financial benefits of teaching eventually are offset by  its time  demands. Students therefore are encouraged to actively  seek  out and  apply for university and outside sources of financial aid,  especially  for the semesters immediately following the qualifying exam. Residency Requirements:UC has stronger requirements for residency than the State of California. Establishing residency should be your first priority. With it come a number of benefits, not least qualifying for in-state tuition once residency has been established. The following explanation is from a residency adviser at UCOP. Please read carefully and follow up on the recommendations:Incoming students should be aware that by default, ALL students need to satisfy the residence requirements by acquiring all applicable legal indicia and 366-days of continuous physical presence ending on the Residence Determination Date for the relevant term. As an example, for the UCB 2018 term, the student must be physically present in California by 8/24/2017 and acquire a CA driver’s license OR state ID card AND relinquish your existing out of state driver’s license if you own one all by 12/15/2016, register to vote if citizen, register car if applicable, and file CA income  tax returns as a resident (recommended to file even if income threshold to file).  The one-parent requirement doesn’t apply to graduate students.In regard to the physical presence requirement, leaving California to visit a prior place of residence (usually family residence) is considered inconsistent with establishing residency.  UC policy will allow up to six weeks of travel during the first year but going home during school breaks will result in a nonresident classification.Full information is available at http://ucop.edu/general-counsel/_files/ed-affairs/uc-residence-policy.pdf .  Additionally, only the campus residence deputies are authorized to provide guidance and to issue resident classifications; statements by other UC personnel should not be relied upon. See http://registrar.berkeley.edu/tuition-fees-residency/residency-tuition-purposes/basic-requirements-residency (which duplicates this information) and for questions go to the Residence Affairs Supervisor at the Office of the Registrar.Even if year one nonresident tuition is covered, the student needs to immediately take all steps to satisfy the residency requirements for year two to receive resident tuition. © UC Regents 2014.
