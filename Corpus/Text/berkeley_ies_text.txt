All Rights Reserved.Privacy Statement Participants at the IES-Der Kreis graduate student workshopOn December 6, Der Kreis, a graduate student working group sponsored by IES, organized a workshop on “Modern German Histories” held in the conference room of the UC Berkeley Social Science Matrix. Consisting in three panels, the workshop allowed six graduate students from Stanford and UC Berkeley to discuss their work on a wide range of topics. These panels were moderated by Professors Tara Zahra (University of Chicago), Edith Sheffer (Stanford University), and Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann (UC Berkeley).Ian Beacock (Stanford University) began with his paper entitled “On Emotions & Political Violence: The Killing of Walther Rathenau.” Through an engagement with parliamentary transcripts, cabinet documents, newspapers, and magazines, Beacock sought to highlight a commonly overlooked debate surrounding political emotions that emerged following the 1922 murder of Walther Rathenau, Germany’s Jewish foreign minister during the time.Then, Maria DuBois (UC Berkeley) presented her paper “The Man Builds the House, and the Woman Keeps It!: Feminine Probity, Practicality, and Patriotism in the Diaries of Women Travelers and Settlers in East Africa, 1860s-1920s,” in which she illuminated the role of motherhood during Germany’s imperial period.Sheer Ganor (UC Berkeley) also presented a paper entitled “Forbidden Words, Banished Voices. Jewish Refugees at the Service of BBC Propaganda to Wartime Germany,” which explored the paradoxical importance of Jewish refugees’ positions within the BBC’s German Service in England.Later, Benjamin Hein (Stanford University) spoke on “Migration Backed Securities. Emigrants Underwrite the New Transatlantic Economy, 1860-1873,” throughout which Hein examined the emigrant-cotton exchange between the American South and Europe and how such transatlantic trade stimulated the growth of Imperial Germany’s economy.Next, Elena Kempf (UC Berkeley) engaged with the legal imaginations of Henry Dunant and Johann-Caspar Bluntschli in her paper, “War, Law, and Time: Codifying International Humanitarian Law in Late Nineteenth Century France and Germany.”Finally, Julia Wambach (UC Berkeley) highlighted the influence of the German occupation of France on the French attitudes towards their own occupation of Germany following the Second World War in her paper, “In search of the German resistance: experiences, expectations, and the French occupation of Germany 1945-1955.” In all, the fifteen participants in the day’s proceedings benefited greatly from the opportunity receive constructive feedback on their work as well as to engage in the lively discussions that ensued following these presentations of forthcoming scholarship.Institute of European Studies

All Rights Reserved.Privacy Statement Undergraduate conference in European Studies, with the members of the jury and presenters Nitisha Baronia, Kevin Mahoney, Ziang Zhou, and Yinan ZhangThe European Union Student Ambassador (EUSA) group, an official UC Berkeley student organization supported by IES and the European Commission, hosted its second Undergraduate Conference in European Studies on November 30. During the conference, participants presented research proposals answering the question of whether or not a collective European cultural or political identity exists. These proposals were then judged by a panel of faculty and diplomats. This semester, the team of judges was composed of Maria Ripoll, Higher Education Officer at the French Consulate; Helena Malikova, IES’ current EU fellow who works in the EU Directorate General for Competition; IES Director Jeroen Dewulf, Spanish Studies Program Chair Emilie Bergmann, and IES visiting scholar Max Baumgart (Univ. of Cologne). Four UC Berkeley undergraduate students, Nitisha Baronia, Kevin Mahoney, Ziang Zhou, and Yinan Zhang, along with one Berkeley City College student, Diego Parada, were finalists and presented different perspectives on and interpretations of the question. Ultimately, Baronia, who focused in her paper on the growth of rightwing populism in Europe, was declared the winner. Overall, the event offered a stimulating opportunity for the approximately fifty undergraduates, faculty, and community members in attendance to consider the ever-so-prevalent issues surrounding the formation of a European identity.Institute of European Studies

All Rights Reserved.Privacy Statement IES supports the annual Claremont-UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the EU held at Scripps College. The conference is open to all undergraduates in California, and Berkeley always has strong representation. The primary purpose of the conference is to enhance undergraduate training in and knowledge of the European Union and US/European relations and to allow US students with expertise in different areas to interact with each other as well as with international faculty, foster intercampus cooperation, and recognize the excellent work achieved by students. Envisioned as an intercampus undergraduate seminar, the participating campuses simultaneously offer courses on the issues relevant in Europe today and design the curriculum to encourage student initiated research and presentations. Having completed individual projects, students from each participating institution and their faculty mentors gather for an interactive conference focusing on European issues and student research.  Drawing over 50 students annually from institutions across the nation, it is the only known forum for undergraduate students to share their research on the EU.Political Economy (PE) is one of the six undergraduate majors in the interdisciplinary dept. of International and Area Studies; it offers a Minor in European Studies (ES). PE majors must complete nine upper-division courses including PE 100 and PE 101: both have a primary focus on Europe. A course providing historical context is required—for ES concentrators this might be “Old and New Europe” (History), or “Politics of European Integration” (Poli. Sci.). The remaining four courses comprise the ES concentration and are selected from UC Berkeley’s diverse departments under the guidance of a PE faculty advisor. IES Assoc. Director Crawford serves as its faculty advisor. For more, go to Minor in European Studies.A second interdisciplinary undergraduate option for ES concentrators is the Interdisciplinary Studies Field Major (ISF), providing undergraduates the opportunity to develop individual interdisciplinary majors with courses selected from all disciplines under the guidance of an ISF faculty advisor. IES Assoc. Director Crawford is the faculty advisor for ISF students who choose a European focus for their Senior Thesis. For more, go to ISF.IES coordinates a DeCal course on Europe, taught by students for students. For applications, go the DeCalwebsite. To learn more about the course, please click here.IES supports the annual Travel Study course to the Benelux countries in Europe, where students learn about the EU in Brussels and Luxembourg. They also visit the European Investment Bank and the European Parliament. To learn more about this course, please click here.Study abroad is an unparalleled way of experiencing Europe during your time at UC Berkeley. By engaging firsthand with European people and cultures, you will be able to expand your understanding of European history, language, and contemporary issues, while enriching your studies in new and dynamic ways. UC Berkeley offers study, research, and internship programs in Europe to students from all majors. Summer, semester, and year-long study programs are available, and most programs do not require any language prerequisites.IES supports the teaching of Less Commonly Taught European Languages (i.e. all European languages with the exception of English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish) on the UC Berkeley campus. It also wants to encourage the use of LCTL library materials for academic research. Currently, undergraduate can learn European languages from seven language departments: Comparative Literature (Greek), French, German (German, Dutch), Italian, Scandinavian Studies (Finnish, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Irish/Gaelic, Welsh), Spanish and Portuguese (Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan), and Near Eastern Studies (Turkish). Slavic languages and Eastern European languages are supported by the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies. For an overview of all European languages taught on the Berkeley campus, go to our European Languages Portal.IES supports the creation of new European LCTL courses on the Berkeley campus as well as the creation of new courses in existing LCTLs that privilege reading knowledge and new teaching methodologies that facilitate academic research.IES also wants to encourage students and faculty to use more European LCTLs library materials for academic research. Students, both undergraduate and graduate, and faculty who wish to use Library materials (books, ebooks, graphic novels, dissertations, DVDs, etc.) written in a European LCTL and published in Europe that are currently not available on the Berkeley campus, can fill out the Library Recommendation Form and mention “IES LCTL Support” in the Comments section. IES provides special funding to the UC Berkeley Library to finance the purchase of these materials. This support only applies to LCTLs that are still spoken in Europe; no support will be given for classical or extinctlanguages nor for Slavic and other Eastern European languages supported by the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies.In cooperation with the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, IES supports the work of the UC Berkeley Library subject specialists to enhance the European collections in general and LCTL collections in particular. For more information on all European collections at the UC Berkeley Library, please contact our subject specialists:Michaelyn Burnette (English and Celtic languages)English collectionsJim Church (International Documents + EU Depository Library)EU Depository Library collectionsShayee Khanaka (Turkish, Kurdish, and Maltese)Jeremy Ott (German and European Nordic languages)German collectionsScandinavian collectionsSteve Mendoza (Dutch)Dutch collectionsLiladhar Pendse (Slavic and other Eastern European languages, including Romanian)Slavic and Easter European CollectionsClaude Potts (Romance languages + Breton and Euskara)French collectionsItalian collectionsSpanish and Portuguese collectionsThrough the Undergraduate Research Assistance Program, IES offers undergraduate students an opportunity to do research and to participate at the organization of events about Europe.
