The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program (AAADS) is dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Americans of Asian ancestry, and the framing of this knowledge and critical understanding within local, national, and global contexts. Tracing its genealogy to the Third World Strike and the formation of the field of Ethnic Studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Asian American Studies program initially centered on domestic U.S. concerns regarding the political, economic, and cultural challenges confronting people of Asian descent and their struggles for inclusion and advancement in U.S. society. While retaining its original commitment to community empowerment through socially engaged research, teaching, and service, the program has broadened its scope to encompass issues of transnationality and diaspora in response to geopolitical and demographic shifts.Reflecting the collective strengths of our faculty, our curriculum offers students a deeper understanding of the histories and contemporary realities of the different ethnic groups that comprise the "Asian American" category. Through classroom-based and experiential learning, our students engage with critical issues such as labor, migration, health, representation and cultural production, education, religion, class, gender, generation, law, public policy, and social activism. *For more information about and to donate to the AAADS 50th Anniversary Fundraising Campaign click here

© UC Regents 2014. All Rights ReservedHigher Education Website Design by WebvantaThe Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies Program is grounded in the decolonization and liberation projects of U.S. Latina/os and their allies in the civil rights, gender, and sexual liberation movements of the 1960s that continue through the present in new forms that address new conditions. Our courses on the U.S. Latina/o experience continue the historic mission of contributing to the production of truly universal knowledges about the United States and an increasingly interconnected world beyond the limited scope of Eurocentric or other ethnocentric perspectives and the disciplinary constraints in traditional fields of the humanities and social sciences. To achieve this we take seriously the knowledges, epistemologies and critical thinking produced by racially and sexually oppressed subjects, and we endeavor to examine the entangled intersectionality of racialized sexuality, gender, and class in complex socio-historical processes.  We also engage comparative U.S. ethnic, hemispheric Americas, and global comparative studies to trace the movement of Latina/o communities and their cultures.  As an interdisciplinary group of scholars, we offer courses in the social sciences, geography, history, literature, visual cultural studies, performance arts, public policy, education, health, theater, film, media, religion, and philosophy. In addition, we offer practicum courses in creative writing, research methods, visual and performance arts and field studies/internship experience in various community organizations.

© UC Regents 2014. All Rights ReservedHigher Education Website Design by WebvantaThe study of race should be grounded in a deep understanding of the particular historical, social, economic, cultural, and political experiences of individual racialized groups as well as an analysis of the relationships among them.  Established in 1975, our Comparative Ethnic Studies (CES) program builds on and extends beyond the groups covered in our other majors by analyzing the multiple and intersectional ways in which groups are racialized, operate within and contest various forms of power, and build alliances. Collectively our faculty provide a wide range of interdisciplinary analyses across geographical areas, among various racialized peoples, and with other markers of social difference such as gender, class, and sexuality.  Our CES program enriches the study of individual racialized and indigenous groups and has long provided a model for the development of other Ethnic Studies departments across the country.

The specificity of the Native American situation must be understood in terms of indigeneity and the colonial forces confronting it. Any engaged understanding of Native people—historical or contemporary—must start from the fact of their prior presence as autonomous societies with relationships to the land. From this foundation follows the significance of colonialism, and particularly settler colonialism, as the primary form of domination confronted by Native peoples in ongoing struggles for justice.Our Native American Studies program considers broadly the relationship of indigeneity and settler colonialism, foregrounding the historical contexts and constraints through which indigenous individuals and polities have expressed and continue to express themselves. Indigenous epistemologies, histories, languages, cultural texts and social practices are key arenas of analysis as we examine the unique experiences of Native Americans. Grounded in the study of history, culture, language, law and policy, the frameworks that enrich our research include comparative global indigenous studies, women and gender studies, queer studies, subaltern studies, immigrant and refugee histories, and transnational and diasporic studies.

© UC Regents 2014. All Rights ReservedHigher Education Website Design by WebvantaPrograms / GraduateFounded in 1984, the graduate program in Ethnic Studies is the first interdisciplinary PhD program in the U.S. dedicated to the study of comparative race and ethnicity in national, hemispheric, and global contexts. It continues to be a premiere PhD program that provides rigorous interdisciplinary training as well as critical grounding in comparative, relational, and intersectional analysis made possible by the core subfields of the department—Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies, Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies, Native American Studies, and Comparative Ethnic Studies.The graduate program draws on faculty strength in a wide range of fields, including studies of race, ethnicity, indigeneity, gender, and sexuality; citizenship, migration, and borders; diaspora and transnationalism; sovereignty and decoloniality; representation and performance; social movements and cultural politics; religion, food, museums, labor, and war. Students learn social science and humanities methodologies, including archival research, ethnography, oral history, and textual and visual analysis. Students also have the opportunity to pursue a “Designated Emphasis” in such areas as Critical Theory, Film Studies, New Media, and Women, Gender, and Sexuality. For more information on program requirements, please refer to the Ethnic Studies Graduate Handbook.Our graduate program has trained generations of award-winning scholars,  dedicated teachers and social-cultural critics who now work in a wide range of academic, cultural, private, and public institutions. Our graduate students continually receive the most prestigious national fellowships and awards, such as those granted by the Ford Foundation, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and have one of the highest placement rates (78.6%) among all UC Berkeley doctoral programs (57.2%).

© UC Regents 2014. All Rights ReservedHigher Education Website Design by WebvantaPrograms / UndergraduateEthnic Studies is the critical and interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity with a focus on the experiences and perspectives of people of color within and beyond the United States. Since the emergence of ethnic studies as an academic field in the late 1960s, scholars have analyzed the ways in which race and racism have been, and continue to be, powerful social, cultural, and political forces and their connections to other axes of stratification, including gender, class, sexuality, and legal status.  The Department of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley was one of the first in the nation and has produced some of the most dynamic and influential scholarship in the field.  We offer undergraduate majors and minors in Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies, Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies, Native American Studies, and Comparative Ethnic Studies.

© UC Regents 2014. All Rights ReservedHigher Education Website Design by WebvantaPrograms / UndergraduateChoosing a major is not the same as choosing a career. It is one step in a process that may lead to a number of different career options. Most majors do not directly correlate to specific occupations. Instead, choosing a major allows you to pursue your interests and develop skills that are transferable to a variety of career fields.One way to begin thinking about your choice of major is by addressing the following questions:Each major provides a curriculum that critically examines the historical and contemporary experiences of minority groups in the context of U.S. society and institutions. Each major stresses the analysis of the interrelationships in the historical background, cultural patterns, and artistic expressions of each community in order to acquire a well-rounded, in-depth understanding of the contemporary interface between Asian American, Chicano/Latino, and Native Americans and U.S. society. Each major is interdisciplinary in nature and strives to incorporate various disciplines, such as anthropology, art, education, history, law, literary criticism, political science, public policy, and sociology, in its approach.In completing work for the bachelor’s degree, students in each major acquire and sharpen skills similar to those of other liberal arts majors in the humanities and social sciences. For example, they develop and refine skills in creative and critical thinking, and in analyzing, researching, and understanding people and institutions in different communities and cultures. They also develop and refine skills through well-analyzed and clearly written papers.Students in each major are encouraged to consider minors in fields that will enhance those skills and add to their overall breadth of knowledge. Minors include those in City & Regional Planning, Creative Writing, Education, English, Gender & Women’s Studies, Geography, and Public Policy.Majors are also encouraged to develop or enhance their skills in speaking and writing in another language. Acquiring internship and/or volunteer experience is highly encouraged for majors. These opportunities can help students acquire important experience for graduate or professional school and assist with career exploration and developing skills that are desirable in a number of different careers.One popular career option for majors is teaching, either in colleges and universities or secondary schools at the K-12 level. Another career option is in the counseling (clinical, career, or academic) field. A career in law can make good use of the major's specialized knowledge of underrepresented communities. That knowledge is also useful in many different careers, such as: journalism, marketing, community and housing development, radio and television, health and medicine, community and union organizing, social work, and a wide variety of positions in federal, state, and local governments as well as those at the city and county levels.There are a number of colleges and universities that offer master’s and Ph.D. programs in Asian American, Chicano, Ethnic and Native American Studies. Accordingly, persons who seek careers in college and university teaching should acquire at least a master's degree and preferably a Ph.D. ES graduates who desire legal careers should go on to law school and obtain a J.D. degree. Another option is obtaining a degree of M.P.P. (Master of Public Policy) for those seeking careers in economic or community development and policy making. Those who seek careers in counseling should also seek at least the M.A/M.S. degree. The degree of M.S.W. (Master of Social Work) is highly desirable for those seeking a career in social work and an M.P.H. (Master of Public Health) for those interested in the health field.The Career & Educational Guidance Library at 2220 Bancroft Way (next to the University Health Services Tang Center) has an extensive collection of books, articles, and other publications that can help you explore majors and related career fields.The Career & Educational Guidance Library also offers two computer-assisted career guidance systems (My Road and EUREKA) that can help you assess your interests, skills, and values, and identify major and career options.The Career Center located at 2111 Bancroft Way also has an extensive collection of publications and services that can help you explore different majors, various career fields and assist with internship and employment opportunities.The Career Center also offers services related to graduate and professional schools. These services include: graduate school fairs, application workshops, letter service, and personal statement reviews.
