In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean.
This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.
The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness.
They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.
This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changesThey enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy.
Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion. that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades.
 The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands.
  Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.This course provides a general, critical introduction to the history of Mexico from the end of the colonial period to the present. Students interested in Mexican problems and issues will come away with a deeper understanding of how present-day Mexico came to be. Rather than a chronological summation of events and great leaders, emphasis will be placed upon certain themes and trends with respect to economic, social and cultural development and change. We will be particularly interested in the patterns of conflict and negotiation that shaped Mexico’s history and emphasis will be given throughout the course to the ways in which “common people” participated in and influenced the political events of their times. In addition, we will be attentive to the important regional, class, ethnic, and gender differences that have figured prominently in Mexico’s history as well as to the history of Mexico in the wider world. In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.
Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.How do technology and society interact? What drives technological change? How does technology transfer across different cultures? These and other related questions are examined using historical case studies of productive, military, domestic, information, and biomedical technologies. We shall discuss the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, microwaves, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how technology affects social change and, especially, how technological change is invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course you will be able to think historically about technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technological change -- or lack thereof. The course draws approaches and materials from both history and science. Throughout, however, we emphasize historical development. The ideas and artifacts of technology are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills.

If you are interested in History 182T, please contact the instructor during the first week of class.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day.
  Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.
At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience.

You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.In Spring 2018 this class will offer a special focus on data analytics and information technologies in the contemporary world, as an exemplary case of science, technology, and society. The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley. Berkeley Connect seeks to enhance learning by strengthening contacts between undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty outside of the classroom.We invite you to connect with undergraduates, graduates and faculty in lively conversation about history and the Berkeley experience. Meet a fantastic group of peers. Ask the questions you’ve always wanted to ask. Learn about the practice of history, and explore the Berkeley campus with a dedicated mentor. Discover a new Berkeley!The core of the Berkeley Connect program is a one-credit, pass-fail course that is designed to create a community of students with similar intellectual interests. There is no homework associated with Berkeley Connect: no exams, no papers, no quizzes. Berkeley Connect links undergraduate students with experienced mentors in History through small groups of 10-20 students that meet regularly. Small group meetings help students share ideas and learn new skills, as well as foster friendships and provide a supportive intellectual community. Participants will also meet with mentors one-on-one for academic guidance and advice.The only requirement for joining Berkeley Connect is that you have an interest in the field of study. You do not have to be a major in order to participate! Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.  This course examines the United States from roughly 1812 to 1860. Although historians have designated this period antebellum [‘before’ + ‘war’] in reference to the Civil War that began in 1861, war was by no means inevitable to people who lived in the United States in the preceding decades. The first half of the nineteenth century was indeed shaped enormously by slavery, but the daily lives of ordinary Americans were also affected by many institutions that, in contrast to slavery, feel profoundly modern: mass media, capitalism, work performed for wages, and the two-party political system. This class will explore the life, culture, economy, and politics of an era that saw the development of many of the characteristics we associate with modern living in the United States. We will examine race relations, popular culture, class formation, gender roles, urbanization, immigration, territorial expansion, democratic politics, religious experience, and popular science. Crucially, we will also probe the limits and fault lines of these national ideas and institutions, paying particular attention to the role of race, ethnicity, class, and region in shaping men and women’s opportunities and experiences. Assigned readings will be composed primarily of personal narratives written during the antebellum era.Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher. By 1973, all this had changed. This course will explore these and other transformations, all part of the making of modern America. We will take care to analyze the events, significance and cost of US ascendancy to world power in an international and domestic context.History 130 explores the historical development of US foreign policy. The course addresses the making and implementation of national strategy; the evolution of the international system; and the uses of history in the making of policy. Topics covered include the rise and nineteenth-century expansion of the United States; the redefinition of national security in the twentieth century; US involvement in the world wars and the Cold War; and the challenges of making post-Cold War foreign policy.Though there are many ways to imagine a nation (a land, a polity, an ethnic group, a culture), America has also been identified, since its inception, with the process and prospect of people arriving from elsewhere. This course surveys the history of the United States between 1790 and 2001 through the lens of immigration and from the perspective of immigrants. As we follow this tumultuous story, we will pursue three related inquiries:This class surveys the experiences and impact of women in Latin America from the pre-conquest period to the present, as well as the ways that gender ideologies (like patriarchy, honor-shame, machismo) have influenced Latin American history.In order to understand the modern world, one must understand early modern Britain. Why did nation states develop from feudal kingdoms? Why did economic relations get restructured into what is now understood of as capitalism and why does that system seem so intransigent? Why did differences in skin color become justification for enslavement? Why are political hopes seemingly forever caught in a tension between the pessimism that human relations are naturally bent toward a “war of all against all” and the optimism of securing “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” for everyone universally? Why are all of the course descriptions on this website written in English here at a university situated on the crest of the Pacific Ocean? Modernity could have been many different things, but it unexpectedly turned out to be British.Throughout this semester, students will engage with the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious histories of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland from roughly 1485 to 1750. Those histories include religious reformation, global exploration, political revolution, social stratification, science, magic, and intellectual enlightenment, among many others. Our studies will take us field-by-field through emerald shires, to the stuffy and severe corridors of Whitehall, and bounding along the salted seas. We will study everyday life and people who wore utterly ludicrous wigs.Since this is an advanced history course, students will be expected to read deeply, complete frequent writing assignments, take exams, and write a research paper in addition to attending lectures and participating in class discussion.This course will examine the profound economic, social, and spiritual changes that occurred in Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. The themes to be explored include the Crusades (the 7th Crusade of Louis IX and perhaps the 4th Crusade, which ended not in the Holy Land but with the conquest of Constantinople), inquisitions and heresy (the Cathars), the radicalization of the Franciscans, the quality of the papacy's religious leadership, law courts and justice, the acceleration of commercial activity, the transformation of lay piety, and above all the polarization of understandings of “gender.” Readings are largely from primary sources. The format is mostly discussion woven into informal lectures. Requirements are a midterm, a final, and regular reader-response exercises. Depending on enrollment, one or two short (3-5 pp.) papers may be required; if so, then one or both exams will be shortened, the papers effectively replacing one of the exam questions. If papers are assigned, they will require an in-depth analysis of one of the primary sources read. Fascism was a form of rule created in Europe in the 1920s, when world communism was rising and liberalism steeply declining, when racist thinking pervaded all politics, and fears of decadence and secularization and loss of status melded within a rhetoric of the "people" and its sacred rights. Early fascists comprised a movement of a new quality, promoting salvation through recovery of lost wholeness. They enacted politics through violent and confident self-assertion of a "leader" and uniformed followers. Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and form there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy. The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of WWII, and the question why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; and how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We conclude by moving closer to the present and asking what of fascism remains in our contemporary world, as memory and practice. Unfortunately, the topic is of continued relevance.The twentieth century saw unprecedented levels of international economic growth through market exchange and integration, as well as numerous experiments, left and right, at economic independence from reigning financial superpowers. National governments and the international organizations they created alternatively relied on market mechanisms and on expert planning to spur economic growth, raising the living standards of millions in some instances, but also fueling mass unemployment, famine, environmental degradation and even war in other instances. Topics include the gold standard, the Great Depression, the economics of the two World Wars, the rise and fall of the postwar welfare state, the problem of economic development, and the recent return of financial crises.  There are no prerequisites, although a background in economics is useful.This course will focus on the rise and development of early modern Europe's most powerful empires. Rising from the unlikely setting of a weak and fragmented Iberian peninsula in the 15th century, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires went on to become the world's first truly global powers. As such, they had a tremendous impact on the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of not only Iberia, but on significant parts of Europe and the New World.This course offers a survey of the main historical developments in the (two) Netherlands from the middle ages to the present day. Its main focus will be on the early modern era, traditionally considered as the ‘Golden Age’ of the emerging Dutch Republic and the ‘Dark Age’ for the remaining Spanish Habsburg Netherlands. Even so, Rembrandt and Rubens thrived in equally fascinating global empires. The course will focus on several questions of historical interpretation, such as the meaning of the Dutch Revolt, the impact of religion and economy and the making of the Dutch and Spanish world empires. It particularly investigates the questions of existing, emerging and disappearing borders and barriers reconfiguring the many polities along the North Sea. While offering a transregional perspective, it also situates these developments in their wider European and global contexts. An introductory survey of Soviet history from the revolutions of 1917 to the present. Marxism-Leninism, War Communism, and Real Socialism; the Great Transformation and the Great Terror; family and nationality; state and society; Russia versus Soviet; Gorbachev versus the past.This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the "women question," the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to MarxThis course will survey the historical events and intellectual developments leading up to and surrounding the destruction of European Jewry during World War II.  By reading a mixture of primary and secondary sources we will examine the Shoah (the Hebrew word for the Holocaust) against the backdrop of modern Jewish and modern German history.  The course is divided into three main parts: (1) the historical background up to 1933; (2) the persecution of the Jews and the beginnings of mass murder, 1933-1941; and (3) the industrialized murder of the Jews, 1942-1945. Where do modern science and technology come from? How and why do they change? How is their credibility established — or challenged — in modern societies? How do they interact with the rest of our culture? The course examines these and other related questions using historical case studies from different periods. We shall discuss the emergence of science as a defining dimension of modernity, and its relations to other cultural traditions such as magic, religion, and art. We shall pay particular attention to the evolution of artifacts and technological systems such as industrial machinery, weapons, computers, and contraceptives. The aim of the course is for you to learn about how science and technology shape the way we live and, especially, how they are invariably shaped by historical and social circumstances. At the end of the course, you will be able to think historically about science and technology, and thus engage effectively with questions of technoscientific change — or lack thereof.The course draws approaches and materials from both STEM and the social sciences. Throughout, we emphasize historical development. Scientific ideas and technological artifacts are not timeless, and they did not drop from the sky. A main course goal is to practice thinking historically; assignments and examinations call on those skills. The course is aimed at students of all majors; no scientific knowledge is presupposed.Running parallel to History 182A is History 182T, intended for students interested in teaching elementary or secondary school science and math. Students in the "T" course will attend the regular 182A lectures and a special section; this section will focus on techniques, skills, and perspectives necessary to apply the history of science in the juvenile and adolescent science classroom, including pedagogy, devising lesson plans for their classrooms, finding reliable historical information, and writing. History 182T satisfies a requirement for the Cal Teach minor and counts toward a State of California teaching credential. If you are interested in History 182T, please contact Jessica Jones (jdjones@berkeley.edu): Cal Teach enrollment starts in mid-October with Phase I enrollment for Spring 2018.The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e., on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the "outside" world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world.  This class will explore how and why that came to happen.  Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages of players.   Although I am a massive fan the point of the class is not to nerd out but to locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.   Ideally the class will teach you both a lot about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.   There will be a mid-term (30%) and a final exam (40%) with in-class notes allowed.  Section participation will account for the other 30% of the final grade.  The class will be administered through a bcourse site and the hashtag #GlobalSoccer101 will be used to share additional materials.People learn best when they learn together.

The course provides an introduction to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) as a way to study how our knowledge and technology shape and are shaped by social, political, historical, economic, and other factors. We will learn key concepts of the field (e.g., how technologies are understood and used differently in different communities) and explore how human values and technology can interact (e.g., how values are embedded in technical systems, shape the choices of their users, and pose ethical questions for their creators). This class has been proposed to meet the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of the proposed Data Science major.This course explores the complex relationship between the two Koreas and Japan in the twentieth century. Linked by trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago nevertheless share a fraught history characterized by imperialism, colonialism, violence and occupation. We will investigate fascinating puzzles that continue to vex the most accomplished historians, political scientists and sociologists today: How did a region poor in resources and largely isolated from the West emerge as one of economic vitality in the last hundred years? What have been the consequences of war, cataclysmic defeat, stalemate, division, and postwar economic resurgence? Why does Northeast Asia remain perhaps the only place in the world where the Cold War persists today? Assignments include evaluating movie trailers as pretend historical consultants, comparative analysis of news media on historical controversies over comfort women, textbooks, and commemoration, and close interrogation of primary source material. Active reading, short weekly responses, and two medium-length papers will help translate complex ideas into clear and workable essays. Our focus will be on reading historically, approaching texts critically, and fostering great writers whose prose will help them at the undergraduate level and beyond.What is capitalism, how did it develop in the United States, and how have historians studied it? These are the principal questions that will guide this course on the history of American capitalism from the colonial period to the Gilded Age. From the mud machines dredging Baltimore’s harbor to the coal mines of Colorado, we will survey a broad range of people and places to examine how they have shaped and been shaped by capitalism’s development. Though our focus will be on the economic history of the US, we will explore capitalism’s relationship to a variety of changes that defined American history during this period: territorial expansion, colonialism, slavery, urban development, industrialization, financial instability, the construction of race and gender, ecological transformation, and more. Throughout we will engage in an enduring debate about how to define capitalism: Is it best understood as a system of beliefs, a set of institutions, or a distinctive mode of economic production? To find answers, the course encourages you to think broadly about what constitutes capitalism by studying its historical trajectory. This is a reading and writing intensive class, where you will develop your ability to think critically, read carefully, and write persuasively—skills essential for a variety of professional endeavors and for social and political engagement. But you will cultivate these skills in a specific way: by learning how to think historically and “do” history. Each week you will read historical scholarship and examine primary sources to develop your ability to interrogate arguments and make counterarguments, to sort and evaluate evidence, and to use evidence to interpret the past.In order to conquer a territory, you should know where it is. Yet the European colonization of the Americas started with profound geographic confusion: Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach Asia when he landed in the Caribbean. This course charts the connections between geographic knowledge and European efforts to colonize, conquer, and coexist with indigenous peoples in North America. We will use historic maps to explore encounters between Europeans and Native Americans from early Spanish, British and French colonial projects to the rise of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as modern nation-states. Students will study maps made by European explorers and Native Americans alike, and reflect on how humans approach cultural difference in the past and the present. The course will also explore maps as objects, the mapping of rivers and oceans, and the ways that maps reflect how diverse peoples in North America understood spaces, places, and themselves. Throughout the semester, students will work intensively on reading, interpreting, and writing about historical sources, through looking at maps, analyzing written primary sources, and reading a variety of historical literature. Students will develop reading skills for visual and textual sources, strategies of historical thinking and argumentation, and most importantly, strengthen their voices and techniques as writers through the creation of a scholarly research paper.      Julia Lewandoski is a PhD Candidate in the History Department. She is broadly interested in Native American History, Atlantic History, and the History of Science. Her dissertation compares indigenous land tenure during European imperial transitions in eighteenth and nineteenth century Quebec, Louisiana, and California.Today we live in a world of self-proclaimed ‘republics’. But what exactly is republicanism? What are its sources? How has it passed down to our present age? This course offers an introduction to republicanism. We will consider the relationship between republicanism and a number of crucial themes: liberty, virtue, law, the organization of and practice of political power, and commerce. Weekly seminars will involve close reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature. Our readings will take us from the foundations of republicanism in classical antiquity to its revival and transformation in the early modern period, culminating in the political revolutions of the eighteenth century. Although readings will engage heavily in political thought, this course remains above all a history course. This means that students must consider ideas as well as their social, economic, and political context. The acquisition of historical knowledge is inseparable from the development of reading and writing skills.  Engaging with primary and secondary sources, students will learn to identify topics, formulate relevant questions, and undertake independent research. Coursework will include a number of short written assignments and a final research paper. What are the connections between play and work, play and everyday life? Where have Americans chosen to go for play, amusement, and relaxation? How did women and racial minorities carve out spaces of leisure during times of discrimination and segregation? How and why has that changed over time?  This seminar will examine these questions by looking at the social history of recreation in the American City since 1850. The primary focus will be on the settings for commercial leisure, including the activities, social relations, and ideas behind fairly well-known environments—such as theaters, bars and saloons, department stores, expositions, sports venues, amusement parks, cinemas, gambling, and vice districts. Non-commercial public spaces such as local and national parks, and community centers will also be investigated. Related and overlapping issues will include the tensions between home leisure with familial supervision versus commercial leisure in public social settings; recreation’s role in the crossing of or reinforcement of lines between racial and ethnic groups, age cohorts, genders, and social classes; and, lastly, links between growing individual and personal freedom and cultures of leisure consumption.The aim of the seminar is to develop critical reading and writing skills. As part of our course you will read selected books, articles, and primary sources to understand how scholars conceive and argue about recreation and leisure. The course will also serve as an introduction to historical research and will focus on the components of historical thinking: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. The first half of the class will require students to write brief essays focused on developing these basic skills. At the end of the course students will demonstrate their mastery of the various components of historical thinking in a clearly written essay.This course offers a broad introduction to the European Middle Ages through both textual and material sources. Change — as an individual experience and as a social phenomenon — is a central theme. Why did medieval people make radical changes in their lives? Why did European political systems, cultural expressions, and religious ideals change so dramatically over the course of the Middle Ages? The course charts the emergence of a distinctively “medieval” civilization after the demise in the west of the late Roman state and then the transformation of this early medieval civilization after the millennium. The roles of demographic and economic expansion are explored as motors for the radical political, religious, and cultural transformation of medieval society from 1000 to 1500.This course is an introduction to European history from around 1500 to the present. The central questions that it addresses are how and why Europe—a small, relatively poor, and politically fragmented place—became the motor of globalization and a world civilization in its own right. Put differently, how did "western" become an adjective that, for better and often for worse, stands in place of "modern."This is an introduction to Chinese history from the 13th through the 20th centuries -- from the Mongols and Khubilai Khan's conquest of southern China to the amazing turnaround following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and the opening of the era of reform that has led to China's emergence as a major economic and strategic power today. The course assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history.What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.This course will cover the history of the "Middle East" as a historical, geographic, political, and cultural category. It will be framed by the historical construction of the category in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, then reach back to the advent of Islam in the seventh century CE and forward to the present. Themes will include the Middle East in the Mediterranean world, religion and politics, interconfessional relationships and conflicts, and the changing relationships to Europe, Asia, and Africa over the centuries.What is foreign policy, who makes it, and to what avail? This freshman seminar, “Making U.S. Foreign Policy,” will introduce students to the study of U.S. foreign policy. The course will assess the institutional and bureaucratic dimensions of foreign policy, beginning with the Constitution and the organization of the American government for the conduct and implementation of foreign policy. Readings will consider the evolving international context for foreign policy, the utility of strategy, and the particular challenges the United States faces as the world’s dominant superpower. The course will offer an introduction to academic disciplines and methods for studying foreign policy and international relations more broadly. Students will also explore and engage campus resources, including visiting speakers from the professional foreign policy community.Scheduled to meet for the first half of the semester only, this once-a-week two-hour seminar will analyze documentaries that explore and expose the endangerment of children and youth in Africa. Documentaries on child trafficking and enslavement, child brides, child laborers, street children and youth, victims of FGM, child soldiers, HIV/AIDS orphans and urban youth gangs will be viewed in class. The goal of the seminar is to examine the complex local, regional, and at times global factors behind the extensive abuse and endangerment of children and youth in Africa. In order to historicize and contextualize the study, we shall, in addition to the documentaries, refer to a limited number of published articles.Is it the end of the world as we know it and do we feel fine!?  Our seminar explores apocalyptic beliefs and hope for the end of the world in the early modern Atlantic world and/or the desire for the transformation of the world and society—a yearning for a future egalitarian world led by a savior figure.  We will examine topics such as the history of apocalyptic ideas and millenarian traditions, early modern movements in Iberia, France and England, millenarian hopes for the New World, colonial dreams and rebellions, and nineteenth century undertakings from Brazil (Juzeiro and Canudos) to the United States (Millerites).  This course is concerned broadly with the relationship between the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘politics’; and the practices of violence which lie at their intersection; and in particular with rethinking the terms we use to imagine religious violence in the past and the present. As a case study, we will explore ways of conceptualizing the longue durée history of the relationship between Hinduism and Islam in the Indian subcontinent over the last millennium. Through reading a mix of postcolonial historical scholarship and precolonial primary sources, we will critically investigate the Islamic conquest of India; the historic evolution of the concept of ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’; the profound fissure of the partition of India in 1947; and the evolving politics of memory in the twentieth century. No prior experience with the history of India is required for this class. People learn best when they learn together. That premise underpins all our activities at Berkeley.

Undeclared freshmen and sophomores are welcome, along with entering junior transfers and juniors and seniors.When President Calvin Coolidge declared in 1925 that “the chief business of the American people is business,” he was not making a historical argument, though it would have been a defensible one. Nearly a century earlier, French visitor, Alexis de Tocqueville, made a similar observation. Indeed, America was colonized by joint-stock corporations! Understanding the history of American business can therefore unlock a great deal about America itself. How did capital exchange become capitalism and how did capitalism affect American lives? How have capitalist markets been constructed socially and legally? What has been the historical relationship between capitalism and gender, race, freedom, and inequality? We will explore these questions on a chronological journey from seventeenth-century cotton trading to twenty-first century foreclosure. A survey of the role of organized violence in the history of the Mediterranean, from the collapse of the Bronze Age palace system to the Arab invasions of the seventh century AD. Focusing on a series of well documented conflicts (i.e. the Peloponnesian War, the Punic Wars, Caesar in Gaul), we will examine ancient military institutions and their place within ancient states, as well as the relationship of warfare to various social and cultural developments. Some coursework in the Ancient Mediterranean is recommended, but not required.In this course we will examine the fascinating, competing histories and cultures of the Baltic coast city known variously as Danzig and Gdańsk (among other spellings and forms).  First a medieval Slavic (Polish/Kashubian) fishing village, then a growing port city under the rule of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross (XIV century), then the largest city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (XV century to 1795).  Freed from the hated overlordship of the Teutonic Order and, as the chief city of Royal Prussia (a semi-autonomous district of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Gdańsk (still largely German speaking and a Hanseatic city) was Poland’s main access to the wider world through export and import.  Except for a brief period of intendant status as, once again, a “Free City” in Napoleonic times (1807–1814), from 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland) to 1918 (end of WWI), Danzig was a city of diminished significance in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire.  In the twentieth century, it became a focal point of German-Polish tensions.  The Treaty of Versailles (1918) did many things:  among them it created a “Free State (not “City”) of Gdańsk,” governed (loosely) by the League of Nations; it also resurrected a free and independent Second Polish Republic, still a multi-ethnic federation, but with much changed borders, and with a promise of “free and secure access to the sea.”In this course, students will examine the history of Latin American relations with the United States from independence to the present. We will consider both the political history of U.S.-Latin American relations (scrutinizing major turning points in foreign policy, occupation and intervention), as well as transnational histories of the region (through topics such as immigration, human rights, the African diaspora, feminism, drugs, and tourism). Course readings will reflect this breadth of material - students will be required to critically engage with primary sources ranging from declassified CIA records to oral histories with migrant workers.This course aims to provide a nuanced historical understanding of the history of family, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East (here defined as the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran), from the pre-Islamic period to the present day. The course begins with the origins of Islamic norms of gender and family in the late-antique Arabian Peninsula, setting the stage for later challenges and interpretations. We will then move chronologically and thematically to consider such topics as the role of households in the growth of pre-modern states, western representations of the “oriental woman,” and the politicization of sexual identities in the modern age. Throughout the course, we will put legal and social norms in conversation with the complex fluidity of men and women’s lived experiences. In examining the role of women in society and politics, shifting attitudes towards pleasure and same-sex relations, and the powerful variety of family and kinship structures underpinning everything from war and sovereignty to social and economic reproduction, the course seeks to add texture and nuance to the study of a region generally associated with conflict and repression. As it recovered from one of the most devastating epidemics in world history, Europe in 1400 was a patchwork of wealth and poverty, law and disorder, urban enclaves and vast peasant hinterlands. Whatever unity it had depended on an inheritance from the Roman empire, above all a Church whose institutions gave a semblance of order and coherence to this heterogeneous continent. Over the next 600 years, "Christendom" would give way to a host of new Christianities; this Europe would give way to political and cultural forms collectively if vaguely called "the West." And one of the chief products of this transformation was the emergence of something called "religion," understood to be somehow distinct from other realms of experience and power such as "society" or "the state."This class charts this epochal transformation, paying special attention to the violent expansion of Europe to the Americas, the conflicts attending the European Reformation, the history of the missions, the development of sects and denominations, the theory and practice of toleration, the emergence of modern secularism, as well as the challenge of religious minorities in modern America and Europe.At the end of the Peloponnesian War, some of Athens’ enemies proposed that the great city, now starved into defeat, should be razed to the ground and turned into pastureland for sheep. So dramatic a reversal, so severe a punishment, was unthinkable to most Greeks even in the heated moment of their unexpected victory, and the proposal was not approved. It remains, however, indicative of a major turning-point in Greek history and will serve as our point of departure. This course will explore the changing face of the Greek world in the late Classical period, an age of political experiment and struggle for hegemony; the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late fourth century and the Hellenistic world of the kings and dynasts who fought their way to power after his death; and the process by which Rome, nothing more than a little Italian city-state at the beginning of this period, was drawn into the eastern Mediterranean and came to conquer the entire Greek world. Other topics will include cultural interactions between Greeks and their non-Greek neighbors, including Persians, Indians, Jews, Egyptians, and Romans; kings; cities, civic identity, and civic benefactors; federalism; religious change; economic growth and practices; mercenaries and pirates; warfare; patronage of the arts; and major developments in science, mathematics, and philosophy.Readings are assigned on a weekly basis, and must be completed before your section meeting for the week in which they are assigned. There will be two short papers (5-7pp), bi-weekly online quizzes, a two-part midterm, and a cumulative final exam. The breaking of pre-modern empires and the formation of national states in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran; Islam and nationalism.This course explores the history of the wars that engulfed Vietnam during the post-WWII era. While focusing on the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), it also examines the history of the First Indochina War (1946-1954) and the Third Indochina War (1978-1980). It will address military, political, and social dynamics of the conflict as well as representatives of the war in film, fiction, and memoirs.Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the "subaltern" classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.The general theme of this course is Japan's emergence as a world power in its two phases, military and economic.  Our chief concern will be with the experience within Japan of that emergence and its consequences: the impact on farming villages (including colonial villages sending labor migrants to Japan) of "late" industrialization; the emergence of a conflict, played out in actual lives, between notions of individuality vs. collective identity (based on class, nationality, and gender) and between different collective identities; the horror of total war; the transformation of values that came with defeat and occupation; the nature of postwar democracy and relation of society to state; the changing way(s) in which Japanese view and participate in the world outside Japan.
