 The Graduate Research Award in Egyptology and Assyriology exists to support outstanding research by doctoral students in the department’s three tracks: Assyriology, Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. The funds, when available, will be set aside on an annual basis at the discretion of the department Chair. Awards must be pre-approved by the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) prior to incurring. The maximum amount that can be requested per award cycle may vary from year to year. There is no minimum award. For various reasons students may not always be awarded the full amount requested.The annual maximum amount that can be requested for AY 2017-18 is $1,800.Academic activities that may be funded by the award include:Activities not supported include but are not limited to:Students may not apply for an award retroactively.EligibilityOnly doctoral students in one of the department’s three tracks are eligible for this award. Students must be in years 1–5 in good academic standing and must have “Good” status with respect to academic progress. In extraordinary circumstances students may apply for funds in year 6, but such funds are not guaranteed. Students are not eligible to apply for more than one award per cycle (see below) but may apply for multiple awards in a given academic year.ProcedureApplications must be submitted to the DGS, with a copy to the department manager, via email and include all of the following information:The concise description (one page or less) of the proposed academic activity must include the date(s), location(s), and academic purpose and goals of the activity. The detailed, research-based budget should provide the rationale for the proposed expenditures and reflect that the student has looked into ways to minimize costs.Any publications or public presentations that result from funded research must expressly acknowledge departmental support.Awards are made by the DGS in consultation with the faculty, when necessary. Late or incomplete applications will not be accepted. Priority will be given to:An award can be received in one of three cycles:Funds not allocated in one cycle are generally incorporated into the pool of available funds in subsequent cycles for the remainder of the fiscal year; likewise, allocated funds that are not spent may be carried over past the award end date until the end of the fiscal year. However, funds cannot be carried over into the new fiscal year. If a proposed project does not fit neatly into one cycle, every effort will be made to be flexible; in such cases students should plan ahead and consult with their advisor and the DGS about how to proceed. Awards are normally processed as reimbursements. Students are required to submit hard copies of original receipts to the Department Manager within two weeks of completing the funded activity.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of Egyptology and Assyriology at Brown University offers three tracks to the doctorate (PhD): Assyriology, Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. Through the Graduate School’s Open Graduate Education Program the Department also offers a master’s degree (AM) for students concurrently enrolled in a PhD program in another department at Brown.This document provides program-specific information for graduate students in the Department and is thus intended to complement the Graduate School’s published policies and procedures. For comprehensive information about University-wide policies on matters such as funding, leaves of absence, and the like, students should consult the Graduate School Handbook:https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/academics/rules-regulations/graduate-school-handbookApplicants to the PhD program are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant faculty and/or the Director of Graduate Studies. Prospective students should also consult the respective web pages of both the Department and the Graduate School:Department: https://www.brown.edu/academics/egyptology/Graduate School: https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/programs/egyptology-and-assyriologyAt present the Department does not accept applications to its master’s program from students who are not already enrolled at Brown in a PhD program.Department Chair: Prof. John Steele (john_steele@brown.edu)Director of Graduate Studies (DGS): Prof. Matthew Rutz (matthew_rutz@brown.edu)Department Manager: A. Catherine Hanni (a_hanni@brown.edu)Financial support of five years is granted to incoming doctoral students funded through the Graduate School with the expectation that this will be their full support during the entire course of their studies. This funding includes a stipend, tuition and fees remission, and a health-insurance subsidy. The stipend is intended to cover the calendar year, not simply the academic year, and students are therefore expected to work on their research during the summer. When progress towards the degree is considered excellent, students may spend time in the summer on professional development, for instance, on outside research fellowships, archaeological fieldwork, or teaching positions.The University expects research and writing of the dissertation to be completed by the end of a student’s fifth year in the program, at which point guaranteed University funding ends. For students who require a sixth year of funding and do not receive it from another source (e.g., an external fellowship, the Open Graduate Education Program, University-wide interdisciplinary opportunities, or the Deans Faculty Fellows program), the Department will do its best to provide sixth year funding, although it is not guaranteed in every case. In order to be considered for sixth year funding from the Department or to receive the Department’s support for an application to the Deans Faculty Fellows program or one of the University’s interdisciplinary opportunities, we expect students to have met two milestones:Please note that completing these milestones is a minimum requirement for consideration for sixth year funding. If the dissertation has not been completed and accepted within seven years of the time the student first entered the program, the Department may require a second set of comprehensive examinations before the dissertation is finally accepted. As per Graduate School rules, students who have not completed their dissertation within five years of being admitted to candidacy must apply to the Graduate School for an extension of candidacy. Students should be aware that such extensions are not guaranteed.Students will receive one of the following appointments during each semester that they are funded:On entering the program, students will be assigned a primary advisor in their field of interest. Students are expected to consult their advisors on a regular basis to discuss course selection, research projects or publications, exam preparation, external funding opportunities, and other aspects of academic life and professional development. Students may elect to switch to a different advisor at any time, providing the new advisor is willing to act in that capacity. After the student has completed coursework, it is expected that the chair of the dissertation committee will play the role of primary advisor.The University requires 24 credits of graduate enrollment. This is accomplished over the course of six semesters by a combination of coursework and TA-ships. The appropriate courses will be determined by the student in conjunction with the primary advisor, the DGS, and the faculty most relevant to the student’s intended course of study. The three degree tracks (Assyriology, Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity) each have their own required courses, some of which may be waived depending on a student’s background and abilities (see below). However, the waiver of specific required courses does not obviate the University’s 24-credit requirement.For the first year, students are on fellowship and take four courses each semester. During the second through fourth years, the Graduate School requires service in the form of teaching assistant (TA) or teaching fellow assignments or, less commonly, proctorships. Each student will have one such obligation per semester; the appropriate balance and specific assignments will be determined by the faculty in consultation with the DGS. When performing service during their coursework students will take four courses during semesters they act as proctors but three courses during semesters they serve as teaching assistants; this accommodates the 15–18 hours weekly time commitment for TAs defined by the Graduate School. TAs receive one enrollment credit per semester as a TA.The Department’s policy on students receiving a provisional course grade of Incomplete (INC) is the same as that of the University. Incompletes are strongly discouraged, may only be taken in extraordinary circumstances with prior approval of the professor, and they must be completed expeditiously to avoid being placed on academic warning (see below). The Office of the Registrar sets the following guidelines for the completion of incompletes: Unless an earlier date is specified by the instructor, grades of ‘INC’ must be made up as follows: for Semester I [= Fall], by mid-semester of Semester II; for Semester II [= Spring], by the first day of the following semester.Inadequate performance in courses, while serving as a TA, teaching fellow or proctor, or on exams can be grounds for being placed on academic warning at the discretion of the faculty of the Department (see below). Students on warning will be given explicit instructions about milestones that must be reached to be returned to normal status. While on warning students are expected to focus exclusively on their University commitments and may not receive departmental funding for conference attendance nor take on outside employment or internships.The Department currently offers three tracks to the PhD: (1) Assyriology, (2) Egyptology, and (3) History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. Minimum course requirements for each track are as follows (courses marked * may be waived on demonstration of existing competency):(1) Assyriology: six courses reading cuneiform texts (primarily Akkadian, including Introduction to Akkadian* and Intermediate Akkadian*; at least one course in Sumerian; possibly also Hittite and/or Ugaritic), two courses on Near Eastern archaeology/art history, one course on scholarship in the ancient Near East, two courses on the archaeology, history, and/or language of a second culture (which could include Hittite and/or Ugaritic, among others), one research seminar (Archaeologies of Text), and one Reading and Research course.(2) Egyptology: Middle Egyptian I–II*, Middle Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Late Egyptian*, Ancient Egyptian Religion, Ancient Egyptian Literature, History of Ancient Egypt I–II*, at least one course in the basic material culture of ancient Egypt (or, with the approval of the student’s advisor, an advanced course in Egyptian archaeology), two courses in the history, culture, language or archaeology of the ancient Near East or Mediterranean outside of Egypt, and one Reading and Research course.(3) History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity: Historiography of the Exact Sciences, four courses in the student’s primary ancient language*, two courses in a secondary ancient language*, three courses in the history/archaeology/culture of the primary culture, one course in the history/archaeology/culture of a secondary culture, two courses on ancient science/scholarship offered within the Department, two courses in the history of science offered by another department (e.g., History), and one Reading and Research course. At least two of the language courses should involve the reading of scientific texts.As indicated above, beyond the minimum course requirements students in all three tracks are required to take at least one Reading and Research course. Typically taken in the spring semester of the third year, this course provides an opportunity for advanced students to engage with faculty in a focused way on a topic and/or theme that will contribute directly to the student’s research agenda. For example, students may use the Reading and Research requirement to undertake preliminary research around a possible dissertation topic, to prepare a journal article for submission, or to read broadly and/or deeply in a particular area or areas in preparation for the PhD Qualifying Projects.There are three sets of examinations required of all PhD students in the Department:1. French and German Reading Exams. These reading exams must be passed no later than 31 July prior to the third year of coursework. They will normally consist of a journal article or selection from a book to be studied overnight, followed by an oral examination by the faculty member who acts as the examiner; it is customary for students to provide the examiner with an outline of the reading (in English) in advance of the oral examination. The exam itself will consist of questions about and discussion of the assigned reading in order to demonstrate the student’s ability to comprehend and critically engage with important scholarship in the field. With the approval of the student’s primary advisor and the DGS, a student may replace one of the French or German reading requirements with another appropriate modern foreign language. A language exam will be waived in the case where the language is the student’s native tongue.2. Comprehensive Exams. The Comprehensive Exams are normally administered toward the end of the second year of coursework (hence their other common designation “second year exams”) and are intended to demonstrate the student’s knowledge in all aspects of her or his chosen field. In the Fall semester of their second year students will meet with the relevant faculty and the DGS to discuss the timing, subjects, scope, and composition of these exams, which must be agreed upon and confirmed in writing prior to the Reading Period of the same semester. The Comprehensive Exams will be both completed by the student and assessed by the faculty no later than 31 May following the student’s second academic year. Some exams may be take-home essays, others timed written and/or oral exams. All of the Comprehensive Exams must be passed satisfactorily before the student can take the PhD Qualifying Projects. In the case of an unsatisfactory performance, a second examination may be scheduled at the discretion of the faculty. The second examination must be both completed by the student and assessed by the faculty no later than 15 August of the same year. No Comprehensive Exam may be taken more than twice. In the event of a first or second unsatisfactory performance, the student may petition the Department to receive a terminal master’s degree (AM), again at the faculty’s discretion.3. PhD Qualifying Projects. The PhD Qualifying Projects are normally initiated during the final year of coursework and are intended to demonstrate professional competency. These projects will usually focus on different topics that are all related directly or indirectly to the student’s primary research interests and intended dissertation area. The projects take the following form:The specific topics, including the book for review and the title and topic of the course for the syllabus, will be decided in conjunction with a committee of at least two and normally three faculty, at least one of whom must be from the Department. The student, prospective readers, and DGS must agree in writing on the precise composition of the projects prior to Reading Period of the Fall semester of the student’s third year. It is not expected that the projects will be completed at the same time, but all three projects must be submitted no later than 31 July after the student’s third academic year. Following the submission of the projects, the committee will confer to make their assessment and communicate whether or not the projects have been judged acceptable; the committee will then set up a discussion with the student to give feedback on the projects and discuss prospects for the student’s dissertation topic. If the readers find any project unacceptable, the student will have until 15 December to resubmit the revised project(s). A student may not formally submit a dissertation proposal for approval until the committee has deemed the Qualifying Projects acceptable. In the event of a first or second unsatisfactory performance on the Qualifying Projects, the student may petition the Department to receive a terminal master’s degree (AM) at the faculty’s discretion.In addition to the doctoral dissertation, which is the program’s culminating research requirement, the Department has two research requirements for all PhD students: an academic conference paper and a peer-reviewed journal article. Both requirements are important milestones in a junior scholar’s academic career.All students are required to present at least one formal conference paper during their time in the program. Possible venues include the annual meetings of the American Oriental Society (AOS), the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE), the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), an international conference in the student’s field, or a more focused academic conference in the student’s area of research. Be advised that the calls for papers for all conferences circulate quite early and that abstracts are typically due well ahead of the conference itself. Students should consult with their advisors about the best topic and venue for the conference paper.All students are required to publish at least one peer-reviewed journal article during their time in the program. Students should consult early on with their advisors to determine their best work and most suitable possible venue[s] for publication. Possible scenarios include: publishing a written version of the student’s conference paper; publishing the student’s PhD Qualifying Project (journal article); publishing part of the student’s doctoral dissertation results; publishing a significantly revised version of a research paper from a seminar or Reading and Research course; publishing the results of other independent research that was conducted in a museum, during archaeological fieldwork, or over the summer.Because Brown’s doctoral programs train graduate students to become educators as well as researchers, teaching is an integral part of graduate education. All doctoral students in the program are required to train as teaching assistants for a minimum of 3 semesters. In consultation with the DGS, this requirement may be fulfilled during any of the years in the program, but it is typically done in years two, three, and four. Although not strictly required, interested students may have the opportunity to serve as teaching fellows who teach either a new course of the student’s design or a course that is already established in the curriculum. Students should be aware of the resources and opportunities at the University to develop skills in teaching, in particular the offerings of the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning and its certificate programs:https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/sheridan-center/No more than six weeks following the successful completion of PhD Qualifying Projects, the student will submit a doctoral dissertation proposal prepared in consultation with the advisor and readers. Ordinarily there will be significant overlap between the readers of the proposal and the qualifying projects, though changes or additions may be made in consultation with the DGS. The readers must include a primary advisor from within the Department and at least two additional readers. The student’s proposal should be about 10 pages in length (excluding the catalogue and bibliography) and will include: a working title; the research question and a concise summary of previous research on the intended topic; a statement of the purpose, goals, significance, and originality of the project, with a clear justification of the necessity for the proposed study; a clear presentation of the evidence, methods, and procedure for carrying out the research; a detailed outline of the proposed dissertation with chapter summaries; a detailed project timeline and work plan for research and writing; a catalogue of sources; and a comprehensive bibliography.The advisor will first assess the proposal and will likely require revisions. Once revisions have been made, the advisor and at least two additional readers will evaluate the revised proposal, offer comments and suggestions (possibly requiring further revisions), and vote on its acceptability. Following a favorable vote, the student is formally admitted to candidacy for the PhD, a status commonly known as ABD (“all but dissertation”). Shortly after the proposal has been accepted, the student will present the proposed project in the Department’s research colloquium series.The formal dissertation committee will consist of an advisor from within the Department, and at least two additional readers, one of whom must come from outside of the Department, preferably from outside the University. Normally external readers from outside the University are formally added to the dissertation committee after the proposal has already been approved by the program, though in some cases it may be appropriate to involve the external reader earlier in the process. While researching and writing the dissertation the student should expect to meet with the advisor on a fortnightly basis and keep the readers apprised of her/his progress with occasional updates.When the dissertation committee has approved the completed dissertation, ideally midway through the fifth year, the dissertation defense will be scheduled. The penultimate version of the dissertation must be circulated among the readers at least two weeks prior to the defense. The defense will consist of two parts: a formal public lecture and a closed defense.The lecture is an opportunity for faculty and students in the Department and wider University to learn about the doctoral candidate’s work on the dissertation. The talk should last approximately 50 minutes plus 10–20 minutes for questions. The presentation should cover the background to the project, an overview of the research itself, and a discussion of the most significant results found in the dissertation. Please note that this talk is not meant to be a celebration of the end of the PhD, an opportunity to express thanks, and the like, all of which has its proper place at Commencement at the end of May. Rather the lecture should be a serious presentation of the dissertation to an interested audience.The formal defense will be a private meeting between the doctoral candidate and the dissertation committee, which will normally include an external examiner. Typically the defense will last about 2 hours, but there is no fixed duration for the meeting. The main topic of discussion during the defense will be the dissertation itself, but it is normal for there also to be some discussion of the context of the research (e.g., other scholarship on the topic, the relevance of the dissertation to related areas of research, etc.) as well as discussion of the prospects for publishing the student’s research after completing the PhD. At the conclusion of the defense, the dissertation committee will vote on whether to recommend that the Graduate School award the student the PhD on the basis of the dissertation, potentially pending revisions. Following a favorable vote, the student is considered to have achieved the PhD, even though the degree itself may not be awarded for several months after the defense. The Department has no requirements for the format of the dissertation beyond those set by the Graduate School. Filing of the final dissertation is subject to University guidelines; however, a hard copy of the final dissertation must be deposited in the Department as well. The student must also submit a final electronic copy to the DGS.Students writing dissertations should be aware that the procedures surrounding the defense and filing of the final dissertation always take substantial planning and time to execute:https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/academics/rules-regulations/dissertation-guidelinesThe University has only one graduation per year at the end of May, and final dissertations and all associated paperwork must be filed with the University by 1 May of the year of graduation. In order to realistically meet this goal and to give dissertation readers sufficient time to read and comment on the thesis, a complete and mature draft of the dissertation should be given to all members of the dissertation committee at the beginning of the student’s final semester, typically in February.Student progress will be evaluated each semester, and the student will be informed of her/his standing through banner and through individual communications with the DGS. banner allows three evaluations: “Good,” “Satisfactory,” and “Warning”. These terms are set by the University and thus require some clarification from the program. Students who perform well in coursework and service (i.e., as TAs, teaching fellows, or proctors) and meet all requirements on time will maintain “Good” status in the program. In fact “Good” status is the program’s expectation for all students, which is to say that the Department regards a “Satisfactory” evaluation as an indicator of unsatisfactory progress and as a sign that the student needs to significantly improve his/her performance. “Warning” status indicates that the faculty have very serious concerns about a student’s progress, which, unless addressed, could lead to the Graduate School withdrawing the student from the program.Students who take one incomplete in a course at the end of a semester will automatically be given a “Satisfactory” evaluation. In order to return to “Good” status, the incomplete must be rectified within the normal timeframe established by the University (see above). Students may also be given a “Satisfactory” evaluation for marginal but still satisfactory performance on the Comprehensive Exams or PhD Qualifying Projects, for poor or inconsistent performance as a TA, teaching fellow, or proctor, or for insufficient progress in the writing of the dissertation. Students with a “Satisfactory” status may not be eligible for various programs or research funds available through the Department or the University.Students who have more than one incomplete or who fail to rectify an incomplete will be placed on “Warning”. Other reasons for being placed on “Warning” include but are not limited to unacceptable performance as a TA/teaching fellow/proctor, failing the Comprehensive Exams, producing unsatisfactory PhD Qualifying Projects, or failing to make adequate progress on the doctoral dissertation (proposal, research, writing). Students on “Warning” will be informed in writing of the reasons and given the specific milestones they must achieve within a specified period of time in order to come off “Warning” status. Students who do not achieve those milestones may be withdrawn from the program. While a progression from “Satisfactory” to “Warning” may occur, be aware that a student can move directly from “Good” to “Warning” status for any valid reason. For further details on the timing, procedure, and consequences of “Warning” status, students must consult the Graduate School Handbook.Progress Reports. The program requires that all students beyond their first year submit a short annual progress report (300–500 words) that summarizes the student’s accomplishments in the areas of research, teaching, and service for the previous academic year and the following summer. This short document should include, for example, a description of summer research activities, reflections on the accomplishments of the previous academic year, and an articulation of specific goals for the coming academic year. Reports should be sent to the DGS and the student’s advisor via email on or before 1 September. This report should serve as a tool to catalyze a conversation between the student and her/his primary advisor about the student’s plans for the coming academic year and beyond.Doctoral students at Brown University who are enrolled in another PhD program may obtain an master’s degree (AM) in Egyptology and Assyriology. This is generally undertaken through the Graduate School’s Open Graduate Education program.Course requirements: 8 courses, of which at least 3 must be 2000-level graduate seminars taught either in the Department (ASYR, EGYT) or by jointly appointed faculty in archaeology (ARCH). Of the 8 courses, at least 2 must be in either Egyptian or Akkadian language, and at least two must be on the history or archaeology of either Egypt or the ancient Near East. The remaining courses are to be chosen by the student in consultation with the DGS, who must approve all course selections used to fulfill the requirements of the master’s degree.Capstone project: Students must research and write a 5000-word paper on a topic of their choosing within the area of Egyptology and Assyriology. The aim of the paper is not necessarily to undertake original research, but rather for the student to demonstrate a sufficiently broad knowledge of the field, the ability to identify an appropriate research question, and the ability to find appropriate primary and secondary source material relevant to the topic. The project will be assessed by two faculty members in the Department.In all matters relating to double counting of courses between AM and PhD programs and related matters, the Department will defer to University-wide policies and/or the policies of the student’s PhD department.The Department has a limited number of desks in offices that, conditions permitting, can be temporarily assigned for PhD students to share. Desk assignments for the coming academic year will be made during the summer months and will depend upon the availability of space in the Department. Priority will be given to students writing dissertations and to those students serving as teaching assistants/fellows, but this should not be taken to mean that students are guaranteed dedicated work space in the Department. Students should be aware that the assignment of a desk one year does not guarantee that the student will be assigned a desk in subsequent years.Graduate students travelling overseas on Brown University business (e.g., for conferences, museum research, or fieldwork) are expected to register with the Brown University Global Assistance Program through International SOS. Instructions on how to do this may be found at:https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/global-engagement/office-global-engagement/planning-your-global-activityFurther information is given in the Graduate School Handbook.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of Egyptology and Assyriology  ('E/A') was formed in 2006 from the merger of Brown’s world-renowned Departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It continues to be a leading center for scholarship in Egyptology (the study of ancient Egypt’s languages, history and culture), Assyriology (the study of the languages, histories and cultures of the ancient lands of present-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey), and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology and mathematics).  Faculty research interests include Egyptian language, religion, warfare, and kingship; Mesopotamian literary and scholarly texts, history, divination, medicine, and science; the archaeology and languages of ancient Turkey; the relationship between text and archaeology; the study of calendars and chronology; and, the history of astronomy, astrology, and the related sciences in the ancient world. In addition, department faculty direct archaeological projects at the sites of Abydos in Egypt, Uronarti in the Sudan, and Labraunda in Turkey.  Undergraduate students have wide-ranging choices in courses including introductory language, history and archaeology as well as topical classes on subjects such as Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion, literature, and science. Many of our classes are open to all students at Brown and have no prerequisites. Concentrators in the department have the option of following tracks in either Egyptology or Assyriology. Both tracks provide students with a solid background in the field through exposure to the critical study of these ancient cultures using the tools of archaeology, epigraphy, and historical inquiry, and a variety of interdisciplinary, comparative, and theoretical approaches in order to explore these regions’ ancient languages and literatures, political and socio-economic modes of organization, art and architecture, religious traditions and other systems of knowledge, such as ancient exact sciences.   At the graduate level, students may pursue one of three tracks to the PhD: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. Each track is designed to provide students with the skills needed to undertake high quality research in their respective field. In addition, our PhD program pays close attention to the professional development of our students, in particular through training in teaching, the writing of journal articles, and presenting papers at conferences. Our students regularly present their work at international conferences and publish in the main journals in our fields, and participate fully in departmental research seminars.  'E/A' has a thriving research culture which includes a weekly departmental seminar series, frequent guest lecturers, and regular long-term visitors who come to the department to work with our faculty and to use Brown’s library resources (in particular Brown’s excellent collection of Egyptology literature and the Pingree collection of books, microfilms, and photocopies of early scientific manuscripts). Over the past few years the department has organized conferences on topics including new approaches to how the earliest stages of the Egyptian language are to be understood, the archaeologies of text, and the circulation of astronomical knowledge in the ancient world.  The department also enjoys close links with other units at Brown including the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World and the Departments of Classics, History and Religious Studies. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

The Department of Egyptology and Assyriology of Brown University is pleased to announce the inauguration of a new series of scholarly monographs, Wilbour Studies. The series is named in honor of Charles Edwin Wilbour, an American amateur Egyptologist (1833–1896) whose estate provided a bequest for the establishment of the department. The series editors, James P. Allen (Egyptology) and John M. Steele (Assyriology), invite submissions of manuscripts from all areas of ancient Egyptian and ancient Near Eastern studies, with particular emphasis on recent PhD dissertations of distinction from North American universities. All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Manuscripts will be prepared for publishing and printed by Lockwood Press; guidelines for the preparation of manuscripts can be found on the press's website (www.lockwoodpress.com/Submission.html).Titles in the SeriesVol. 1: The Ancient Egyptian Books of the Earth, by Joshua Aaron Roberson (February 2012)Vol. 2: Landscape Archaeology of the Western Nile Delta, by Joshua R. Trampier (March 2014)Vol. 3: Coping with Obscurity, edited by James Allen, Mark Collier and Andréas Stauder (May 2016)Brown University’s Department of Egyptology and Assyriology and Lockwood Press are willing to work with authors whose manuscripts have been accepted for publication to achieve a publication that accommodates insofar as possible the author’s preferences within the overall design of the Wilbour Studies series.  A number of general guidelines, however, should be observed.ReferencesThe two guiding principles are to avoid interrupting the flow of thought within the text and to make the work as easy as possible for the reader to use. For that reason, references within the body of the text (Harvard style) are discouraged, and footnotes rather than endnotes should be used. Footnotes should be placed, wherever possible, after major punctuation marks (semicolons of periods). If a sentence has several items that need a footnote, combine them into a single footnote at the end of the sentence whenever possible.Guidelines for FootnotesBibliographyAll footnote references need a corresponding bibliographical entry. The bibliography should be arranged alphabetically by the author’s last name. If more than one work of an author is cited, the works should be arranged chronologically from earliest to latest, with the author’s name replaced by a five-em dash after the initial entry. If there is more than one work for a given year, use letters to distinguish them (e.g., 2010a, 2010b). Journal and series titles should be given in full, unless abbreviations are provided in aseparate list (see below).Templates to follow are:Additional MaterialAs a courtesy to the reader, every work should have a list of all but the most common abbreviations (typically, titles of journals and series), and one or more indices.

Preserved for us in ancient texts and images, their ideas share some things in common with more familiar ancient traditions, such as the creation account in the Bible. In this course, you will look at these ancient texts and images and learn how to dissect them to find what their authors were thinking. In the process, you will discover some surprisingly sophisticated concepts that are still present in our own culture.

Topics surveyed include medical handbooks and recipes, physicians’ equipment and training, gods, demons and disease, pregnancy and childbirth, veterinary medicine, the health effects of the ancient Egyptian diet, and later myths about Egyptian medical knowledge. DPLL WRIT  1.000 Credit Hour  1.000 Lecture Hour  Levels: Graduate, Undergraduate, Schedule Type: Primary Meeting  EGYT 1490 - Calendars and Chronology in Ancient Egypt and the Ancient World Time is the dimension of history. Chronology studies how we know when events happened. Chronology is much more important to "BC history" than to "AD history." History books state that the great Ramses II ruled around the thirteenth century B.C.E. But how do we know this? The focus of this class is on the answers to such questions through the study of the foundations of the history of Egypt specifically and of the ancient world in general. Some prior knowledge of Egyptian language or civilization might be handy but is by no means required.   1.000 Credit Hour  1.000 Lecture Hour  Levels: Graduate, Undergraduate, Schedule Type: Primary Meeting EGYT 1500 - Ancient Egyptian Art and Architecture Ancient Egyptian art and architecture had a remarkably long history, and much that was produced is amazingly well preserved. This course will focus on the inception and development of these material expressions of high culture through detailed studies of monumental buildings and decorated private tombs, as well as the sculpture, painting, and minor arts from the Predynastic period through the end of the Middle Kingdom (c. 3700-1790 BC).

Deir el-Medina is usually considered the paradigmatic site-witness for studies of Egyptian daily life and benefits from a substantial material record. Through a multi-perspective analysis drawing on both tangible (archaeological structures) and intangible (textual/iconographical) sources, ancient and modern (excavation diaries and new discoveries recently made on the spot!), this course aims at discovering the lifestyle, practices and culture of this community.

What relationship is there between such images and historical events, ritual events, and royal ideology? How do such images function? This seminar will examine Egyptian images of violence and warfare from before the New Kingdom. It will take a contextual and comparative approach to discern patterns in the ways such images are used, with the goal being to understand why they were made rather than how they can be used to answer historical questions.   1.000 Credit Hour  1.000 Lecture Hour  Levels: Graduate, Schedule Type: Primary Meeting EGYT 2900 - Egyptian Art in New England Museums This seminar will be an in-depth, in-person study of Egyptian art from before the New Kingdom focusing on the entire life-history of Egyptian art in all available media and genres.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownBrown is one of the premier institutions for the study of Egyptology, Assyriology, and the history of ancient science, and our PhD students train in the foundational areas of our disciplines: the languages, literatures, history, and material culture of Egypt and Mesopotamia in their wider environment. The department offers instruction in the core ancient languages that are essential for research in our fields: Akkadian (Babylonian and Assyrian, all stages), Egyptian (all stages), Hittite, and Sumerian. Instruction in Arabic, Aramaic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Sanskrit, Syriac, and Ugaritic is also available at Brown. In addition to training in philology and critical research methods, our students also become conversant in the archaeological sequence, art and architecture, and repertoires of material culture found across the ancient Near East.Brown’s doctoral program in Egyptology and Assyriology has a number of distinguishing features:A few areas of particular interest to the department’s faculty include: ancient science (astronomy and astrology, timekeeping and calendrics, divination and medicine); cultural interactions throughout the Mediterranean, Near East, and Africa in the second and first millennia BC; religion and ritual in the ancient Near East, from Egypt and Sudan to Anatolia and Mesopotamia; the history of the Egyptian language and its grammar; the origins and development of writing and the diffusion and reception of cuneiform, hieroglyphic, and alphabetic scripts in the ancient world; kingship and monumentality in ancient Egypt and Sudan; the integration of textual and archaeological methodologies; Coptic manuscripts; the ancient Near East in classical periods and Greek and Roman cultures’ perceptions of the more ancient past; Mesopotamian and Egyptian literature; ancient empires of the Near East in context; and the origins of Egyptian civilization.The department currently offers three tracks: (1) Assyriology (2) Egyptology, and (3) History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. Each track has different course requirements, details of which may be found in the Graduate Student Handbook. Students who enter the program in one track may switch to another track providing they are still able to complete the coursework requirements by the end of their third year.Applying for Graduate StudiesWe welcome applications to our PhD program from prospective students interested in pursuing graduate studies in Egyptology, Assyriology, and the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. All applications must be submitted online to Brown's Graduate School.For students accepted into the program, Brown’s Graduate School typically guarantees five years of full funding (tuition, fees, health insurance, and stipend to cover living expenses). The typical PhD program at Brown therefore includes three years of coursework and exams, followed by two years dedicated to researching and writing a doctoral dissertation that constitutes an original contribution to scholarship in the student’s field.Egyptology and Assyriology has overlapping interests with a number of other academic units at Brown, especially Anthropology, Ancient History, Classics, Religious Studies, and the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. We advise prospective students with interests that cross multiple disciplines to contact the faculty in the relevant programs to discuss which program would be the best fit. The Department of Egyptology and Assyriology will normally not consider applications from prospective students who have applied to more than one program at Brown.Further details about applying for our graduate program may be found here. Please note that the deadline for submitting applications to the Graduate School is 15 December for admission into the program for the following September.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown The Graduate Research Award in Egyptology and Assyriology exists to support outstanding research by doctoral students in the department’s three tracks: Assyriology, Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. The funds, when available, will be set aside on an annual basis at the discretion of the department Chair. Awards must be pre-approved by the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) prior to incurring. The maximum amount that can be requested per award cycle may vary from year to year. There is no minimum award. For various reasons students may not always be awarded the full amount requested.The annual maximum amount that can be requested for AY 2017-18 is $1,800.Academic activities that may be funded by the award include:Activities not supported include but are not limited to:Students may not apply for an award retroactively.EligibilityOnly doctoral students in one of the department’s three tracks are eligible for this award. Students must be in years 1–5 in good academic standing and must have “Good” status with respect to academic progress. In extraordinary circumstances students may apply for funds in year 6, but such funds are not guaranteed. Students are not eligible to apply for more than one award per cycle (see below) but may apply for multiple awards in a given academic year.ProcedureApplications must be submitted to the DGS, with a copy to the department manager, via email and include all of the following information:The concise description (one page or less) of the proposed academic activity must include the date(s), location(s), and academic purpose and goals of the activity. The detailed, research-based budget should provide the rationale for the proposed expenditures and reflect that the student has looked into ways to minimize costs.Any publications or public presentations that result from funded research must expressly acknowledge departmental support.Awards are made by the DGS in consultation with the faculty, when necessary. Late or incomplete applications will not be accepted. Priority will be given to:An award can be received in one of three cycles:Funds not allocated in one cycle are generally incorporated into the pool of available funds in subsequent cycles for the remainder of the fiscal year; likewise, allocated funds that are not spent may be carried over past the award end date until the end of the fiscal year. However, funds cannot be carried over into the new fiscal year. If a proposed project does not fit neatly into one cycle, every effort will be made to be flexible; in such cases students should plan ahead and consult with their advisor and the DGS about how to proceed. Awards are normally processed as reimbursements. Students are required to submit hard copies of original receipts to the Department Manager within two weeks of completing the funded activity.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of Egyptology and Assyriology at Brown University offers three tracks to the doctorate (PhD): Assyriology, Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. Through the Graduate School’s Open Graduate Education Program the Department also offers a master’s degree (AM) for students concurrently enrolled in a PhD program in another department at Brown.This document provides program-specific information for graduate students in the Department and is thus intended to complement the Graduate School’s published policies and procedures. For comprehensive information about University-wide policies on matters such as funding, leaves of absence, and the like, students should consult the Graduate School Handbook:https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/academics/rules-regulations/graduate-school-handbookApplicants to the PhD program are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant faculty and/or the Director of Graduate Studies. Prospective students should also consult the respective web pages of both the Department and the Graduate School:Department: https://www.brown.edu/academics/egyptology/Graduate School: https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/programs/egyptology-and-assyriologyAt present the Department does not accept applications to its master’s program from students who are not already enrolled at Brown in a PhD program.Department Chair: Prof. John Steele (john_steele@brown.edu)Director of Graduate Studies (DGS): Prof. Matthew Rutz (matthew_rutz@brown.edu)Department Manager: A. Catherine Hanni (a_hanni@brown.edu)Financial support of five years is granted to incoming doctoral students funded through the Graduate School with the expectation that this will be their full support during the entire course of their studies. This funding includes a stipend, tuition and fees remission, and a health-insurance subsidy. The stipend is intended to cover the calendar year, not simply the academic year, and students are therefore expected to work on their research during the summer. When progress towards the degree is considered excellent, students may spend time in the summer on professional development, for instance, on outside research fellowships, archaeological fieldwork, or teaching positions.The University expects research and writing of the dissertation to be completed by the end of a student’s fifth year in the program, at which point guaranteed University funding ends. For students who require a sixth year of funding and do not receive it from another source (e.g., an external fellowship, the Open Graduate Education Program, University-wide interdisciplinary opportunities, or the Deans Faculty Fellows program), the Department will do its best to provide sixth year funding, although it is not guaranteed in every case. In order to be considered for sixth year funding from the Department or to receive the Department’s support for an application to the Deans Faculty Fellows program or one of the University’s interdisciplinary opportunities, we expect students to have met two milestones:Please note that completing these milestones is a minimum requirement for consideration for sixth year funding. If the dissertation has not been completed and accepted within seven years of the time the student first entered the program, the Department may require a second set of comprehensive examinations before the dissertation is finally accepted. As per Graduate School rules, students who have not completed their dissertation within five years of being admitted to candidacy must apply to the Graduate School for an extension of candidacy. Students should be aware that such extensions are not guaranteed.Students will receive one of the following appointments during each semester that they are funded:On entering the program, students will be assigned a primary advisor in their field of interest. Students are expected to consult their advisors on a regular basis to discuss course selection, research projects or publications, exam preparation, external funding opportunities, and other aspects of academic life and professional development. Students may elect to switch to a different advisor at any time, providing the new advisor is willing to act in that capacity. After the student has completed coursework, it is expected that the chair of the dissertation committee will play the role of primary advisor.The University requires 24 credits of graduate enrollment. This is accomplished over the course of six semesters by a combination of coursework and TA-ships. The appropriate courses will be determined by the student in conjunction with the primary advisor, the DGS, and the faculty most relevant to the student’s intended course of study. The three degree tracks (Assyriology, Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity) each have their own required courses, some of which may be waived depending on a student’s background and abilities (see below). However, the waiver of specific required courses does not obviate the University’s 24-credit requirement.For the first year, students are on fellowship and take four courses each semester. During the second through fourth years, the Graduate School requires service in the form of teaching assistant (TA) or teaching fellow assignments or, less commonly, proctorships. Each student will have one such obligation per semester; the appropriate balance and specific assignments will be determined by the faculty in consultation with the DGS. When performing service during their coursework students will take four courses during semesters they act as proctors but three courses during semesters they serve as teaching assistants; this accommodates the 15–18 hours weekly time commitment for TAs defined by the Graduate School. TAs receive one enrollment credit per semester as a TA.The Department’s policy on students receiving a provisional course grade of Incomplete (INC) is the same as that of the University. Incompletes are strongly discouraged, may only be taken in extraordinary circumstances with prior approval of the professor, and they must be completed expeditiously to avoid being placed on academic warning (see below). The Office of the Registrar sets the following guidelines for the completion of incompletes: Unless an earlier date is specified by the instructor, grades of ‘INC’ must be made up as follows: for Semester I [= Fall], by mid-semester of Semester II; for Semester II [= Spring], by the first day of the following semester.Inadequate performance in courses, while serving as a TA, teaching fellow or proctor, or on exams can be grounds for being placed on academic warning at the discretion of the faculty of the Department (see below). Students on warning will be given explicit instructions about milestones that must be reached to be returned to normal status. While on warning students are expected to focus exclusively on their University commitments and may not receive departmental funding for conference attendance nor take on outside employment or internships.The Department currently offers three tracks to the PhD: (1) Assyriology, (2) Egyptology, and (3) History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. Minimum course requirements for each track are as follows (courses marked * may be waived on demonstration of existing competency):(1) Assyriology: six courses reading cuneiform texts (primarily Akkadian, including Introduction to Akkadian* and Intermediate Akkadian*; at least one course in Sumerian; possibly also Hittite and/or Ugaritic), two courses on Near Eastern archaeology/art history, one course on scholarship in the ancient Near East, two courses on the archaeology, history, and/or language of a second culture (which could include Hittite and/or Ugaritic, among others), one research seminar (Archaeologies of Text), and one Reading and Research course.(2) Egyptology: Middle Egyptian I–II*, Middle Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Late Egyptian*, Ancient Egyptian Religion, Ancient Egyptian Literature, History of Ancient Egypt I–II*, at least one course in the basic material culture of ancient Egypt (or, with the approval of the student’s advisor, an advanced course in Egyptian archaeology), two courses in the history, culture, language or archaeology of the ancient Near East or Mediterranean outside of Egypt, and one Reading and Research course.(3) History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity: Historiography of the Exact Sciences, four courses in the student’s primary ancient language*, two courses in a secondary ancient language*, three courses in the history/archaeology/culture of the primary culture, one course in the history/archaeology/culture of a secondary culture, two courses on ancient science/scholarship offered within the Department, two courses in the history of science offered by another department (e.g., History), and one Reading and Research course. At least two of the language courses should involve the reading of scientific texts.As indicated above, beyond the minimum course requirements students in all three tracks are required to take at least one Reading and Research course. Typically taken in the spring semester of the third year, this course provides an opportunity for advanced students to engage with faculty in a focused way on a topic and/or theme that will contribute directly to the student’s research agenda. For example, students may use the Reading and Research requirement to undertake preliminary research around a possible dissertation topic, to prepare a journal article for submission, or to read broadly and/or deeply in a particular area or areas in preparation for the PhD Qualifying Projects.There are three sets of examinations required of all PhD students in the Department:1. French and German Reading Exams. These reading exams must be passed no later than 31 July prior to the third year of coursework. They will normally consist of a journal article or selection from a book to be studied overnight, followed by an oral examination by the faculty member who acts as the examiner; it is customary for students to provide the examiner with an outline of the reading (in English) in advance of the oral examination. The exam itself will consist of questions about and discussion of the assigned reading in order to demonstrate the student’s ability to comprehend and critically engage with important scholarship in the field. With the approval of the student’s primary advisor and the DGS, a student may replace one of the French or German reading requirements with another appropriate modern foreign language. A language exam will be waived in the case where the language is the student’s native tongue.2. Comprehensive Exams. The Comprehensive Exams are normally administered toward the end of the second year of coursework (hence their other common designation “second year exams”) and are intended to demonstrate the student’s knowledge in all aspects of her or his chosen field. In the Fall semester of their second year students will meet with the relevant faculty and the DGS to discuss the timing, subjects, scope, and composition of these exams, which must be agreed upon and confirmed in writing prior to the Reading Period of the same semester. The Comprehensive Exams will be both completed by the student and assessed by the faculty no later than 31 May following the student’s second academic year. Some exams may be take-home essays, others timed written and/or oral exams. All of the Comprehensive Exams must be passed satisfactorily before the student can take the PhD Qualifying Projects. In the case of an unsatisfactory performance, a second examination may be scheduled at the discretion of the faculty. The second examination must be both completed by the student and assessed by the faculty no later than 15 August of the same year. No Comprehensive Exam may be taken more than twice. In the event of a first or second unsatisfactory performance, the student may petition the Department to receive a terminal master’s degree (AM), again at the faculty’s discretion.3. PhD Qualifying Projects. The PhD Qualifying Projects are normally initiated during the final year of coursework and are intended to demonstrate professional competency. These projects will usually focus on different topics that are all related directly or indirectly to the student’s primary research interests and intended dissertation area. The projects take the following form:The specific topics, including the book for review and the title and topic of the course for the syllabus, will be decided in conjunction with a committee of at least two and normally three faculty, at least one of whom must be from the Department. The student, prospective readers, and DGS must agree in writing on the precise composition of the projects prior to Reading Period of the Fall semester of the student’s third year. It is not expected that the projects will be completed at the same time, but all three projects must be submitted no later than 31 July after the student’s third academic year. Following the submission of the projects, the committee will confer to make their assessment and communicate whether or not the projects have been judged acceptable; the committee will then set up a discussion with the student to give feedback on the projects and discuss prospects for the student’s dissertation topic. If the readers find any project unacceptable, the student will have until 15 December to resubmit the revised project(s). A student may not formally submit a dissertation proposal for approval until the committee has deemed the Qualifying Projects acceptable. In the event of a first or second unsatisfactory performance on the Qualifying Projects, the student may petition the Department to receive a terminal master’s degree (AM) at the faculty’s discretion.In addition to the doctoral dissertation, which is the program’s culminating research requirement, the Department has two research requirements for all PhD students: an academic conference paper and a peer-reviewed journal article. Both requirements are important milestones in a junior scholar’s academic career.All students are required to present at least one formal conference paper during their time in the program. Possible venues include the annual meetings of the American Oriental Society (AOS), the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE), the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), an international conference in the student’s field, or a more focused academic conference in the student’s area of research. Be advised that the calls for papers for all conferences circulate quite early and that abstracts are typically due well ahead of the conference itself. Students should consult with their advisors about the best topic and venue for the conference paper.All students are required to publish at least one peer-reviewed journal article during their time in the program. Students should consult early on with their advisors to determine their best work and most suitable possible venue[s] for publication. Possible scenarios include: publishing a written version of the student’s conference paper; publishing the student’s PhD Qualifying Project (journal article); publishing part of the student’s doctoral dissertation results; publishing a significantly revised version of a research paper from a seminar or Reading and Research course; publishing the results of other independent research that was conducted in a museum, during archaeological fieldwork, or over the summer.Because Brown’s doctoral programs train graduate students to become educators as well as researchers, teaching is an integral part of graduate education. All doctoral students in the program are required to train as teaching assistants for a minimum of 3 semesters. In consultation with the DGS, this requirement may be fulfilled during any of the years in the program, but it is typically done in years two, three, and four. Although not strictly required, interested students may have the opportunity to serve as teaching fellows who teach either a new course of the student’s design or a course that is already established in the curriculum. Students should be aware of the resources and opportunities at the University to develop skills in teaching, in particular the offerings of the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning and its certificate programs:https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/sheridan-center/No more than six weeks following the successful completion of PhD Qualifying Projects, the student will submit a doctoral dissertation proposal prepared in consultation with the advisor and readers. Ordinarily there will be significant overlap between the readers of the proposal and the qualifying projects, though changes or additions may be made in consultation with the DGS. The readers must include a primary advisor from within the Department and at least two additional readers. The student’s proposal should be about 10 pages in length (excluding the catalogue and bibliography) and will include: a working title; the research question and a concise summary of previous research on the intended topic; a statement of the purpose, goals, significance, and originality of the project, with a clear justification of the necessity for the proposed study; a clear presentation of the evidence, methods, and procedure for carrying out the research; a detailed outline of the proposed dissertation with chapter summaries; a detailed project timeline and work plan for research and writing; a catalogue of sources; and a comprehensive bibliography.The advisor will first assess the proposal and will likely require revisions. Once revisions have been made, the advisor and at least two additional readers will evaluate the revised proposal, offer comments and suggestions (possibly requiring further revisions), and vote on its acceptability. Following a favorable vote, the student is formally admitted to candidacy for the PhD, a status commonly known as ABD (“all but dissertation”). Shortly after the proposal has been accepted, the student will present the proposed project in the Department’s research colloquium series.The formal dissertation committee will consist of an advisor from within the Department, and at least two additional readers, one of whom must come from outside of the Department, preferably from outside the University. Normally external readers from outside the University are formally added to the dissertation committee after the proposal has already been approved by the program, though in some cases it may be appropriate to involve the external reader earlier in the process. While researching and writing the dissertation the student should expect to meet with the advisor on a fortnightly basis and keep the readers apprised of her/his progress with occasional updates.When the dissertation committee has approved the completed dissertation, ideally midway through the fifth year, the dissertation defense will be scheduled. The penultimate version of the dissertation must be circulated among the readers at least two weeks prior to the defense. The defense will consist of two parts: a formal public lecture and a closed defense.The lecture is an opportunity for faculty and students in the Department and wider University to learn about the doctoral candidate’s work on the dissertation. The talk should last approximately 50 minutes plus 10–20 minutes for questions. The presentation should cover the background to the project, an overview of the research itself, and a discussion of the most significant results found in the dissertation. Please note that this talk is not meant to be a celebration of the end of the PhD, an opportunity to express thanks, and the like, all of which has its proper place at Commencement at the end of May. Rather the lecture should be a serious presentation of the dissertation to an interested audience.The formal defense will be a private meeting between the doctoral candidate and the dissertation committee, which will normally include an external examiner. Typically the defense will last about 2 hours, but there is no fixed duration for the meeting. The main topic of discussion during the defense will be the dissertation itself, but it is normal for there also to be some discussion of the context of the research (e.g., other scholarship on the topic, the relevance of the dissertation to related areas of research, etc.) as well as discussion of the prospects for publishing the student’s research after completing the PhD. At the conclusion of the defense, the dissertation committee will vote on whether to recommend that the Graduate School award the student the PhD on the basis of the dissertation, potentially pending revisions. Following a favorable vote, the student is considered to have achieved the PhD, even though the degree itself may not be awarded for several months after the defense. The Department has no requirements for the format of the dissertation beyond those set by the Graduate School. Filing of the final dissertation is subject to University guidelines; however, a hard copy of the final dissertation must be deposited in the Department as well. The student must also submit a final electronic copy to the DGS.Students writing dissertations should be aware that the procedures surrounding the defense and filing of the final dissertation always take substantial planning and time to execute:https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/academics/rules-regulations/dissertation-guidelinesThe University has only one graduation per year at the end of May, and final dissertations and all associated paperwork must be filed with the University by 1 May of the year of graduation. In order to realistically meet this goal and to give dissertation readers sufficient time to read and comment on the thesis, a complete and mature draft of the dissertation should be given to all members of the dissertation committee at the beginning of the student’s final semester, typically in February.Student progress will be evaluated each semester, and the student will be informed of her/his standing through banner and through individual communications with the DGS. banner allows three evaluations: “Good,” “Satisfactory,” and “Warning”. These terms are set by the University and thus require some clarification from the program. Students who perform well in coursework and service (i.e., as TAs, teaching fellows, or proctors) and meet all requirements on time will maintain “Good” status in the program. In fact “Good” status is the program’s expectation for all students, which is to say that the Department regards a “Satisfactory” evaluation as an indicator of unsatisfactory progress and as a sign that the student needs to significantly improve his/her performance. “Warning” status indicates that the faculty have very serious concerns about a student’s progress, which, unless addressed, could lead to the Graduate School withdrawing the student from the program.Students who take one incomplete in a course at the end of a semester will automatically be given a “Satisfactory” evaluation. In order to return to “Good” status, the incomplete must be rectified within the normal timeframe established by the University (see above). Students may also be given a “Satisfactory” evaluation for marginal but still satisfactory performance on the Comprehensive Exams or PhD Qualifying Projects, for poor or inconsistent performance as a TA, teaching fellow, or proctor, or for insufficient progress in the writing of the dissertation. Students with a “Satisfactory” status may not be eligible for various programs or research funds available through the Department or the University.Students who have more than one incomplete or who fail to rectify an incomplete will be placed on “Warning”. Other reasons for being placed on “Warning” include but are not limited to unacceptable performance as a TA/teaching fellow/proctor, failing the Comprehensive Exams, producing unsatisfactory PhD Qualifying Projects, or failing to make adequate progress on the doctoral dissertation (proposal, research, writing). Students on “Warning” will be informed in writing of the reasons and given the specific milestones they must achieve within a specified period of time in order to come off “Warning” status. Students who do not achieve those milestones may be withdrawn from the program. While a progression from “Satisfactory” to “Warning” may occur, be aware that a student can move directly from “Good” to “Warning” status for any valid reason. For further details on the timing, procedure, and consequences of “Warning” status, students must consult the Graduate School Handbook.Progress Reports. The program requires that all students beyond their first year submit a short annual progress report (300–500 words) that summarizes the student’s accomplishments in the areas of research, teaching, and service for the previous academic year and the following summer. This short document should include, for example, a description of summer research activities, reflections on the accomplishments of the previous academic year, and an articulation of specific goals for the coming academic year. Reports should be sent to the DGS and the student’s advisor via email on or before 1 September. This report should serve as a tool to catalyze a conversation between the student and her/his primary advisor about the student’s plans for the coming academic year and beyond.Doctoral students at Brown University who are enrolled in another PhD program may obtain an master’s degree (AM) in Egyptology and Assyriology. This is generally undertaken through the Graduate School’s Open Graduate Education program.Course requirements: 8 courses, of which at least 3 must be 2000-level graduate seminars taught either in the Department (ASYR, EGYT) or by jointly appointed faculty in archaeology (ARCH). Of the 8 courses, at least 2 must be in either Egyptian or Akkadian language, and at least two must be on the history or archaeology of either Egypt or the ancient Near East. The remaining courses are to be chosen by the student in consultation with the DGS, who must approve all course selections used to fulfill the requirements of the master’s degree.Capstone project: Students must research and write a 5000-word paper on a topic of their choosing within the area of Egyptology and Assyriology. The aim of the paper is not necessarily to undertake original research, but rather for the student to demonstrate a sufficiently broad knowledge of the field, the ability to identify an appropriate research question, and the ability to find appropriate primary and secondary source material relevant to the topic. The project will be assessed by two faculty members in the Department.In all matters relating to double counting of courses between AM and PhD programs and related matters, the Department will defer to University-wide policies and/or the policies of the student’s PhD department.The Department has a limited number of desks in offices that, conditions permitting, can be temporarily assigned for PhD students to share. Desk assignments for the coming academic year will be made during the summer months and will depend upon the availability of space in the Department. Priority will be given to students writing dissertations and to those students serving as teaching assistants/fellows, but this should not be taken to mean that students are guaranteed dedicated work space in the Department. Students should be aware that the assignment of a desk one year does not guarantee that the student will be assigned a desk in subsequent years.Graduate students travelling overseas on Brown University business (e.g., for conferences, museum research, or fieldwork) are expected to register with the Brown University Global Assistance Program through International SOS.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of Egyptology and Assyriology offers a concentration for undergraduates who wish to pursue the bachelor of arts degree (A.B.). The concentration offers the students a choice of two tracks: Assyriology or Egyptology. Students will be exposed to the critical study of the ancient cultures of these regions (ca. 3400 B.C.E.–100 C.E.) using the tools of archaeology, epigraphy, and historical inquiry. A variety of interdisciplinary, comparative, and theoretical approaches will be introduced to give students the tools and methods to explore the region’s ancient languages and literatures, political and socio-economic modes of organization, art and architecture, religious traditions and other systems of knowledge, such as early science.Assyriology Track The undergraduate concentration in Assyriology (ASYR) requires a total of at least ten (10) courses that are determined in the following way:ASYR 1000 Intro to Akkadian ASYR1010 Intermediate Akkadian History and Culture of Ancient Mesopotamia and  its NeighborsCourses include but are not limited to:
Archaeology of Ancient Mesopotamia and its NeighborsPossible offerings include but are not limited to:  At least one course offered in EGYT or ARCH on the archaeology, art, history, culture, or language of ancient Egypt.At least one elective course on the ancient world broadly defined. Usually this course will be offered in Assryriology, Anthropology, Archaeology, Classics, Comparative Literature, East Asian Studies, Egyptology, History, History of Art and Architecture, Judaic Studies, Philosophy, or Religious Studies. The elective course must be approved by the undergraduate concentration advisor.Egyptology TrackThe undergraduate concentration in Egyptology requires a total of at least ten courses. Six of these must be taken by all concentrators (*), but the remaining four can be chosen from a fairly broad range of courses, to suit individual interests.ASYR 0800 Introduction to the Ancient Near East - or - ARCH 1600 Archaeologies of the Near EastAny course germane to ancient Egypt or the ancient Near East or Mediterranean world. Alternative and elective courses must be approved by the undergraduate concentration advisor. Such courses will normally be offered by Egyptology and Assyriology, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, Religious Studies, Classics, Judaic Studies, Anthropology, History of Art and Architecture, History, or Philosophy. Concentrators are welcome to take most courses offered by Egyptology and Assyriology (EGYT and ASYR), Archaeology (ARCH), or related departments, though some may require the instructor’s approval. Concentrators should consult with the concentration advisor to discuss the courses most suitable to their interests.CapstoneAll concentrators in Egyptology and Assyriology are required to complete a capstone project. The project can take many forms, but the common feature shared among all possible projects will be a public presentation. Typically in the final semester before graduating, the concentrator will give this capstone presentation before faculty, fellow students, and other interested audiences. If the concentrator is writing an undergraduate honors thesis, the procedure for which is detailed below, this work should provide the content for the capstone presentation. Students not writing an honors thesis will base their presentation on a research project more in depth than a class project, though the topic may stem from a course project or paper. The format of the presentation may vary; suggestions range from an illustrated lecture to a video or an installation presented with discussion. Both the content and the format of the capstone project should be discussed with and agreed upon by the concentration advisor no later than the end of the first semester of the senior year.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

A “quality grade” is defined as a grade of “A” or a grade of “S” accompanied by a course performance report indicating a performance at the “A” standard.To pursue honors candidacy, eligible students must:•    Secure a faculty advisor and discuss plans for the proposed thesis project well before the established deadline; this can be done by email when a student is abroad.•    Prepare a thesis prospectus (see below).•    Submit the prospectus to the advisor, one other proposed faculty reader (at least one of the readers must be in the department) and the department chair no later than the first week of the seventh semester.The structure of a thesis prospectus:An honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is a substantial piece of research with some degree of originality that demonstrates the student’s ability to frame an appropriate question and deal critically with a range of original and secondary sources.  A thesis prospectus is a short analytical document consisting of several parts.  It will normally include a concise and focused research question; a justification for that question that demonstrates familiarity with previous research on the topic; a project description that includes a discussion of the types of evidence available and appropriate to answering the proposed question; a discussion of methods of collecting and analyzing that evidence; a conclusion that returns to the research question and assures the reader that the project will add value to our understanding of the topic; and a bibliography.  The prospectus will ordinarily be in the range of 5-7 pages in length, exclusive of bibliography.  The prospectus will include proper citations throughout.Determination of whether or not a student may pursue the proposed project will be made on review of the prospectus by the readers and department chair.  Prospectuses will be evaluated on the following scale: 1.    No concerns about the viability of the project.2.    No concerns about the viability of the project, but minor weaknesses in execution of the prospectus.3.    Concerns about the viability of the project, but willingness to reevaluate a revised prospectus submitted within two weeks of receipt of evaluation.4.    Reservations that the prospectus does not describe an honors-worthy project.5.    Poorly conceived and shoddy work.Prospectuses will be returned to the student with this numerical evaluation and comments one week after submission of the prospectus.  A prospectus must receive an evaluation of 1 or 2 prior to the third week of the seventh semester for a student to be admitted to the honors track.  Students who submit an original prospectus that is graded 4 or 5 will not be permitted to rework the prospectus for second submission.Once accepted as honors candidates, students will pursue a course of study that goes beyond what is expected of a regular concentrator. This includes:•    Enrollment in two semesters of independent study in Egyptology or Assyriology (these do not fulfill course requirements towards the concentration).•    Twice-monthly meetings with the thesis advisor and once-monthly meetings with the second reader.  These meetings will be scheduled at the beginning of each term.•    Submission of a comprehensive outline to both readers no later than October 15 (for May graduates).•    Regular submission of drafts.  A partial draft including a complete version of at least one chapter or section is due before Reading Period of the seventh semester. •    A complete draft is due to both readers no later than March 15 (for May graduates).•    The revised final thesis is due in both electronic and physical form to both readers and the department chair April 5 (for May graduates).Failure to meet any deadline will result in an automatic termination of the honors process.  No extensions will be granted.  If a thesis is turned in late but before the end of the term, credit and grade for the Independent Study may still be granted.In order to receive honors a student must be found to have:•    Remained in good academic standing throughout the academic year.•    Not violated the Academic Code of Conduct during honors candidacy.•    Completed or be about to complete all concentration requirements.•    Produced a thesis that is judged by the readers to meet the department’s expectations for honors work (see below), and turned it in by the established deadlines.•    Successfully defended the thesis during a half hour public presentation held during the final exam period of the eighth semester.Students who submit theses that are deemed to fall short of the expectations will graduate without honors.  In that case, the thesis will count as a capstone project.Originality:An honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is expected to add to existing scholarship.  The thesis must be based on close work with primary sources (usually in publication rather than in person), supplemented by critical engagement with a substantial amount of relevant secondary literature.  While the resulting study is not necessarily expected to be ground-breakingly original, and may engage with a well-studied topic, it will usually include a new insight into or interpretation of the material considered.Scope:An honors thesis is not a book or dissertation.  It is, however, a very serious piece of research and writing for which two dedicated independent study courses have provided substantial time to the honors student.  The question upon which the honors thesis is based should be focused enough to allow an in-depth treatment, generally in under 100 pages or 30,000 words (exclusive of bibliography and illustrations).  Appropriate length will vary considerably depending on the topic itself and the nature of the primary sources being considered, particularly if substantial translation of ancient textual sources is required.Argument:The thesis should present a sustained analytic argument in answer to its structuring question.  A thesis should not be primarily descriptive or narrative in nature.  Each chapter should contain a sub-argument that is clearly related to the overall argument of the thesis.  The significance of the argument and its relationship to prior scholarship should be clearly articulated.  Honors theses are not expected to demonstrate comprehensive familiarity with the secondary literature, but they are expected to engage critically and maturely with important works on the defined topic.Methodology:Egyptology and Assyriology are very broad fields, and the appropriate methods will be determined in conjunction with the thesis advisor on the basis of the question and types of evidence – textual, archaeological, art historical – under consideration. With very few exceptions the methodology of the thesis is expected to be conventional rather than innovative, rooted in the accepted practices of the field in question.Organization and writing:An honors thesis must be well organized and written.  It should include an introduction and conclusion as well as well-considered chapters that allow the reader to follow the line of reasoning easily.  The relationship of any section to the larger whole should be clear, and segues should help the reader move between sections.  Writing should be grammatically correct, well copy-edited, professional, and consistent.  Citations and bibliography must be in an accepted style as determined in consultation with the advisor.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
