          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownHonors Thesis or Project:Students with an excellent record in their Hispanic Studies courses will be eligible to write an Honors Thesis or write and produce an Honors Project. Typically the Honors Thesis is a major research paper of approximately 40 to 80 pages in Spanish, depending on the topic and treatment necessary. Alternatively, a student may, with prior permission of the Hispanic Studies Concentration Advisor, present a film, gallery exhibition, or other appropriate project, together with a paper that clearly demonstrates the academic foundations and relevance of the project. Students should begin thinking about an Honors Thesis or Project in their third year at Brown. Those who study in Spain or Latin America in the spring of their junior year may want to write to professors they might want to work with, indicating their potential thesis interests. Ideally, students will begin to research topics and prepare a reading list for the thesis during the summer before their senior year. The Department expects students to have two readers for their honors thesis or project. Typically, the first reader and advisor for the project will be a faculty member in Hispanic Studies. Both readers and the students will agree on the amount of consultation required and deadlines for submitting drafts and completing readings, it is important that all parties have a clear sense of procedures and deadlines. Students planning to write an Honors Thesis in Hispanic Studies must apply to the Honors Program at the end of semester 6 or beginning of semester 7. The application is available here.  Students then submit an honors proposal consisting of the title, abstract, and bibliography of their project, along with the names and signatures of their advisor and second reader by mid-October, using this form. If the honors proposal is accepted, students will register in HISP 1980, Independent Study, for the spring semester. Most students require two semesters to plan and complete an Honors Thesis or Project. Students will complete at least an outline and a bibliography for their project during the fall semester. Optimally, a substantial portion of the writing will also be submitted to the advisor before Winter Break. The second semester is devoted to completing the writing or the project work, and a full draft of the thesis or project must be submitted to the advisor by mid-March. The final, complete version of the thesis or project must be submitted by mid-April. Students should submit one copy to each reader and one electronic and one hard copy to the Department.Honors thesis timetable:Mid-October: Honors Thesis Proposal dueMid-December: Detailed outline and bibliography dueMid-March: Full draft of thesis to AdvisorMid-April: Final, complete version of the thesis due Concentration AdvisorContact Professor Silvia Sobral (silvia_sobral@brown.edu)Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of Hispanic Studies at Brown University trains students to be both specialists and generalists, language teachers and literature scholars, researchers and active intellectuals. We think of our graduate students as colleagues and teachers of the future, and encourage them to develop their critical and creative interests from the moment they enter the program. Our students also directly enrich the program during the years they spend in training with us by organizing special events such as our biannual graduate student conference, reading groups, and other intellectual and creative activities.Our program begins with a strong training across the various fields of Hispanic Studies. Our faculty represents a broad range of topics and approaches, and students are required to take at least one course with each of our professors during the first two years, culminating in a written examination based on a list of general works. In the third year, students are guided toward more specialized study: in addition to working closely with their chosen advisor on a topic for an article-length major paper, students draw up a list of specialized readings in a major and minor field, leading to an oral examination in the spring semester, and the presentation of a dissertation prospectus shortly thereafter. The fourth and fifth years are dedicated to researching and writing the dissertation, during which time our students can count on careful guidance from members of their committee. In addition to guidance on their research projects, students also receive hands-on preparation for entry into the job market, in which Brown has had notable success in recent years.Students take a total of fifteen courses during their first three years at Brown: three courses per semester in the first and second years (plus one language-instruction methodology course in the spring of the first year), and two over the course of the third year, one of which may be an independent study devoted to work on the major paper. (Students entering the program with an MA may be exempted from up to two courses, after consultation with the director of graduate studies.) Course offerings are plentiful, as each faculty member teaches one graduate seminar each year, from panoramic courses covering broad areas (e.g. Golden Age Spain, Colonial Latin America, modern Latin American poetry or narrative) to more focused seminars on writers, movements, or topics, often transatlantic in scope. While being trained as scholars in Hispanic Studies, students are also encouraged to take classes in related disciplines, such as French and Francophone Studies (with whom we share the beautiful Rochambeau House), Comparative Literature, English, History, Literary Arts, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies.  Students must also show proficiency in two languages other than Spanish and English during the period of their training at Brown; these requirements may be fulfilled by taking a course in the appropriate language, or by passing an exam, or by presenting previous coursework from another institution.From the second year onward, our graduate students serve as teaching assistants and fellows, in courses ranging from beginning to Advanced Spanish, often with the possibility of designing their own survey course in literature in the final year of the program. The Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown offers further training in specific aspects of teaching, and many of our students choose to follow certificate programs to enrich their teaching acumen. We encourage our students to take advantage of the many opportunities for disciplinary exchange and collaborations that characterize intellectual life at Brown, especially through the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the Cogut Center for the Humanities, the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, and the Program for Renaissance and Early Modern Studies. Excellent general scholarly resources are available through the David Rockefeller Library, while the John Carter Brown and Hay libraries contain extraordinary holdings in special materials which are of great interest to both the Brown community and the many visiting scholars who travel to Providence each year. Finally, our students also have the opportunity to take courses at neighboring institutions such as Harvard and Yale, or to study abroad at the Universidad de Santiago de Compostela or the Universidad de Salamanca.Please feel welcome to approach any of the faculty –particular the director of graduate studies—with requests for particular guidance, or with ideas for intra- or inter-departmental events or initiatives you might like to organize. We are delighted to help you expand your cultural horizons and  grow as active scholars, critics, and teachers during your time at Brown.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThank you for your interest in the Department of Hispanic Studies at Brown. We invite you to explore all sections of our website, where you will find detailed information about the structure of the program, the courses we offer, the profiles of our faculty and current graduate students, as well as practical guidelines for the application process itself. If you have any specific questions, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies, Professor Felipe Martínez-Pinzón. The online application for our PhD program is available through the graduate school website, including an electronic application form. Required materials include: a two-page (maximum) statement of your research interests, in English; a CV; a writing sample in Spanish on a subject related to Hispanic literature (12-15 pages double-spaced maximum; do not exceed this length, and do not submit more than one sample); a 2-minute video statement in Spanish about a book or article which has been important to you in your studies (please send a recorded video directly to mary_oliver@brown.edu; you may prepare notes in advance, but please do not read your response; we're most interested in hearing you talk about a subject of interest to you); three letters of recommendation; transcripts; current GRE scores; and where applicable, a current TOEFL score (minimum 90 points) or IELTS (minimum overall band score: 7).The deadline for application to the program is January 3rd; a faculty committee will evaluate materials over the following weeks, and we will contact applicants in early February. Successful applicants will be invited for a one-day visit to campus in early March.Successful applicants will have strong prior training in Hispanic literature or a related field at either the BA or MA level, native or near-native proficiency in Spanish, and excellent writing skills. Ideally, they will also have a sense of research paths they might follow during their time in Brown’s PhD program. On average we admit 3 students per year, which allows for close interaction with faculty, while also producing a tightly-knit cohort to work together closely, inside and outside the classroom.We provide a generous funding package for five years, consisting of a stipend, tuition remission, health services fee, a health insurance subsidy, and including four summers of financial support; many of our students also qualify for a sixth-year dissertation-completion fellowship. Further support is available for travel for research or conference participation. Brown University also offers several exciting possibilities for further support through other programs on campus, for instance the recently instituted Open Graduate Education initiative which allows students to pursue an MA in a second field (with the help of an additional  year of funding). Students are also encouraged to apply for short-term fellowships sponsored by the Office of International Affairs, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the John Carter Brown library, the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, and the Cogut Center for the Humanities, including the Mellon Graduate Student Workshop.We look forward to reading your application!Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownCourseworkStudents take a total of fifteen courses during their first three years at Brown: three courses per semester in the first and second years (plus one language-instruction methodology course in the spring of the first year), and two over the course of the third year, one of which may be an independent study devoted to work on the major paper. (Students entering the program with an MA may be exempted from up to two courses, upon consultation with the director of graduate studies.) Students are encouraged to take a course with each member of the literature faculty, which promotes exposure to a range of different texts and approaches. Students are also encouraged to explore their textual, theoretical, and interdisciplinary interests through courses in other departments at Brown, upon consultation with the DGS. Of the fifteen courses, one is required: a language-instruction methodology seminar, taken in the spring of the first year alongside students from other language departments, and which provides excellent training for future teaching. The Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown offers further training in specific aspects of teaching, and many of our students choose to follow certificate programs over the course of their degree to enrich their teaching acumen. We ensure active interaction between students and faculty during the first years of the program, to mentor and support our students as they move toward more specialized and independent work in the dissertation-writing phase. Faculty members meet twice-yearly to discuss the progress of students still taking coursework, to confirm that all are performing well and in line with the timeline; students will receive letters with a brief assessment of their performance. Note: two or more incompletes jeopardizes good standing in the program; two or more B grades are considered unacceptable, and will result in a probationary period; no grades below a B are accepted. LanguagesAside from fluency in Spanish and English, students must show proficiency in two further languages during their time at Brown: the first by the end of the second year in the program, the second by the end of the fourth year. These requirements can be fulfilled by (a) passing a translation exam; (b) taking two language classes or one advanced seminar (undergraduate or graduate level) for credit; (c) counting comparable work done at a previous institution; or (d) taking an intensive summer course in the language. Preliminary examsWe have recently approved changes to the graduate program to ensure general coverage during the first two years of study, and more focused work in a specific area of interest during the third year. Students who entered the program from 2013 onward will take preliminary exams after their second summer in the program, in September of the third year. These exams will cover a newly-established reading list of 70 books, evenly divided between peninsular and Latin American, spanning medieval to contemporary texts. There will be two exams divided by geographical area, each lasting four hours, and each requiring students to answer three questions out of four. The exams will be discussed and approved by faculty at the first meeting of the new academic year.Major paperAfter passing the preliminary exam, students will begin work on a “major paper”, a 25-30 page study of a topic related to the dissertation topic. Students sign up for an independent study with a faculty member of their choosing to work on this paper; it can be thought of as the first draft of a chapter or article related to the dissertation, or as a methodological exploration of topics to be examined in the dissertation. The major paper should be completed within the semester.Oral exams and dissertation proposalThe spring of the 3rd year is devoted to oral exams and the dissertation proposal. Students should at this point identify at least a primary advisor and a second reader, and may also choose at this point to include a third committee member, who may be drawn from the department, from another department at Brown, or from a related field at another institution. Working closely with these committee members, students will put together specialized reading lists in a major and a minor area, for a one-hour oral exam with the faculty to take place the week after spring break. The dissertation proposal, which should be no more than eight pages (plus a bibliography), is to be presented by the second-last week of the spring semester, and discussed in a meeting with the faculty in the final week of the semester. Fourth and fifth yearsAfter students have advanced to candidacy (once oral exams have been passed and the dissertation proposal accepted), research becomes more independent, and involves fewer members of the department. However, we remain actively involved with our students in professional development, through workshops and individual consultations, in fellowship and grant applications, in putting together articles and book reviews, and with careful guidance through the job market process. We encourage our students to apply in their fourth year for fellowships offered by different entities at Brown, as a way of sharing their research in multi-disciplinary environments, such as fellowships sponsored by the Cogut Center, by the John Carter Brown Library, by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Students who remain in good standing midway through the fifth year, but who need a little extra time to finish writing their dissertation, will be eligible to apply for dissertation completion support through the graduate school.   FallSpring1st year3 seminars; no teaching3 seminars plus Methodology; no teaching2nd year3 seminars; teach 1 course 3 seminars; teach 1 courseFulfill 1st language requirement3rd year2 seminars; major paper; teach 1 courseOral exams and dissertation proposal; teach 1 course4th yearDissertation writing; teach 1 courseDissertation writing; teach 1 courseApply for internal fellowshipsFulfill 2nd language requirement5th yearDissertation writing; no teaching; job market applicationsDissertation writing; no teachingComplete dissertation, or apply for dissertation   completion fellowship   Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWelcome to the Hispanic Studies DUG page. The DUG hopes to bring concentrators in closer contact with our faculty and graduate students, with each other, and with a broad range of activities and disciplines related to Hispanic Studies both inside and outside of Brown. Come here to find out what the DUG is planning, who to contact to become more involved, and the names of some good Hispanic Studies related web links.2017 - 2018 DUG LeadersProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWe contacted recent graduates to give us their first-hand accounts of how Hispanic Studies may have impacted their life after Brown, both professionally and personally.They were asked:Where are you now?Where did your degree in Hispanic Studies lead?How has Hispanic Studies informed your life after Brown?Do you have any advice for current Hispanic Studies students now at Brown, or even students considering a concentration in Hispanic Studies?And it turns out that graduating with a degree in Hispanic Studies has led to a wide variety of career choices and more importantly, a uniquely useful and illuminating skill set to bring along into the world.Healthcare I am a second year medical student at Oregon Health & Sciences University in Portland, Oregon. I took a year off between college and attending a Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Medical program at Columbia University. During the year off I took a job working as an au pair for a Catalan family in a town 30-40 minutes north of Barcelona called "Bigues i Riells". I had taken Catalan during senior year and was excited to go live and breathe the language. I stayed in Spain for the summer after graduation and then returned home to New Haven CT for the rest of the year to apply to post-bac pre-medical programs. I also did some other travel elsewhere like Hong Kong and Japan, and did another trip to Spain later in the year with my brother.It was great as a pre-medical student at Columbia to use my Spanish skills at Bellevue Hospital, interviewing Spanish-speaking patients and their families for pediatric research projects in the outpatient clinic. I did that for roughly three years. Spanish studies also opened me up to other languages like Portuguese and Catalan, both of which I took at Brown and I had a blast doing that.I would recommend thinking hard about whether you want to pursue a career in teaching or perhaps becoming a professor of Hispanic Studies. If you have other interests in the back of your mind like law or medicine, I would try and take more prerequisite courses for those careers during undergrad in order to save yourself time and money in the long run. You can definitely be a Hispanic Studies major and then also complete requirements for those other careers while at Brown, since you only need 8 credits to major in Hispanic Studies. If you just want to go into academics then go all out with literature and language courses while at Brown and make sure to get advice from your advisor or the Hispanic Studies concentration advisor while you're an undergrad.Clinical PsychologyI am living in Boston. I am working as a child/adolescent therapist (I went on to get a graduate degree in clinical psychology), but I work with many Spanish-speaking clients, so my Hispanic Studies have been of great use! My only advice to current students is that Hispanic Studies will be useful regardless of their final career path.International ConsultingA degree in Hispanic Studies has helped land three jobs since graduation:Program Assistant at the Inter-American Dialogue (Washington, DC)Researcher at Eurasia Group (New York, NY)Colombia/Andes Intern with the International Crisis Group (Bogota, Colombia).Being able to communicate at a high level in Spanish has been instrumental in shaping my college and post-college life. At Brown, it allowed me to the opportunity to teach ESL with English for Action. This was an incredible opportunity and one of my most treasured Providence experiences. It also allowed me to travel to Latin America (funded by Brown) to do research for my thesis.Post-college, having Spanish-speaking credentials got me in the door with my first job and allowed me to be successful in working with people from throughout the Latin American region. This ultimately led to extensive travel in the region for conferences and the opportunity to publish work in Spanish-language publications. The ability to read and write in Spanish was especially critical (for primary source research, monitoring news, etc), and Hispanic Studies expertly prepared me for that.My general advice is that having the ability to actually speak and work in Spanish will make anyone a much stronger candidate for jobs in many fields: education, policy, consulting, etc. Many people say they speak Spanish but can't really communicate outside of the classroom setting. Concentrating in Hispanic Studies will give you the necessary skills (and confidence) that many non-native speakers need.Publishing: Literary MagazineI’ll be headed back into academia to get a graduate degree in Hispanic Studies starting in the fall of 2013.  Right now, however, I'm working at The New Republic, a magazine located in Washington, DC. I began work at the magazine in the fall as the literary intern, and there's no doubt in my mind that my extensive exposure to Hispanic literature benefited me in that position—even if the magazine didn't focus all that much on foreign literature, the literary training I acquired in the department was useful in my approach to all literatures. Now, in the spring, I've begun working with the social media arm of the magazine, which has entailed drafting messages for Facebook and Twitter, and even occasionally running the Twitter feed. I've also been able to write one book review for the magazine's website and am currently at work on another. Both reviews are of books translated from Spanish, so in that sense my training in Hispanic Studies allowed me write about the books in what I hope is an intelligent way.As far as advice for current or prospective Hispanic Studies concentrators goes, I would say that testing your comfort zone is one of the most important things to do. That can mean something as grand as studying abroad or even something smaller, like taking a course in an area that you don't think interests you all that much. I know that studying abroad in Barcelona was, for me at least, an experience where I not only sharpened my language skills and acquired important cultural knowledge but also learned a lot about myself, as clichéd as that might sound. Another piece of advice would be to take advantage of the courses offered by visiting professors.   Teaching English AbroadWorking in Hispanic Studies helped develop a lifelong interest in other cultures, and may come full circle if I am able to do a cross-cultural, interdisciplinary study linking historical Hispanic and Chinese relations. I am currently in Beijing, China, teaching spoken English and art appreciation at a local university.My degree in Hispanic Studies hasn't lead to anything concretely related to what I studied, but I have a lifelong passion for Spanish and Spanish literature. They are something to enjoy in my free time and help me interact with a wide range of other people who also speak Spanish or know something about Hispanic culture. My cultural studies started with my interest in Spanish, and my Hispanic Studies degree was a way to legitimize that interest. Participating in the DUG and organizing events also prepared me for the work I do now, helping others improve a foreign language and cross-cultural exchange.To students currently studying or thinking of studying within the department, I say: DO IT. You have nothing to lose. Get outside of your own language, literature, and culture. You'll meet students from different backgrounds and you'll read books/watch movies/write essays that open your mind to a whole new way of seeing--that's the joy of studying a new language. My favorite memory from being a Hispanic Studies concentrator is probably writing an essay--in Spanish--explaining the basic foundations of Chinese Confucianism. My world is huge because I can interact with, at least on a basic level, with people who speak Spanish and now those who speak Chinese. Our world is increasingly global, so it's important to get beyond the big-name fields that are hot right now (business and finance, science and technology, engineering) and figure out how to even interact with the peoples and cultures we want to connect with.Fulbright ETA and TravelLast year, I was a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant (ETA) in Panama. Essentially, I presented enrichment activities in a variety of English classes -- including lots of music, some dancing, and several holiday celebrations! -- and also hosted an English Club focused on speaking practice. While I was abroad, I volunteered with the Forum Foundation, a small NGO founded by former Peace Corps members which focuses on increasing access to education in rural Panama, and with Lions for Sight, an event sponsored by the Lions Clubs to provide free eye screenings and glasses. I also volunteered with TECHO (formerly Un Techo Para Mi Pais), a youth-led NGO whose goal is to eradicate poverty in Latin America. My work with TECHO was the most meaningful part of my experience in Panama -- and if you are studying abroad in Latin America, I'd recommend looking them up! (There are TECHO offices in 19 countries in Latin America.)Currently I'm working as a bilingual flight attendant with Delta Air Lines. Since I am Spanish-qualified, I often fly to Mexico and Central America and have lots of opportunities to practice and improve my Spanish. (Not to mention travel!)In terms of advice, I would recommend that current concentrators get involved in their department! When I was part of the Hispanic Studies DUG, we had the opportunity to plan a lot of fun and interesting events but, because the DUG was fairly new, at times it was difficult to get other students to participate. Creating a sense of community within your chosen discipline is great, not only while you're at Brown, but also after graduation: you'll have a support network of people who share your interests (and may have insights to grad schools, jobs, etc.).Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
