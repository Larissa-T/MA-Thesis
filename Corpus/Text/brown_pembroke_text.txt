Gender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary   concentration  that examines the construction of gender and sexuality in  social,   cultural, political, economic, or scientific contexts. Each  concentrator  will  focus on a well-defined topic or question and work  closely with a  concentration  advisor to develop  a program that  investigates this focus area rigorously and  supplements  it with  foundational courses in the relevant disciplines. Typical   areas of  focus might include the acculturation of gender, sexuality and  race in   American politics or activism; the construction  of sexual and  gendered  identities in educational institutions or in  various forms of  visual media; a  contrast between different cultural  understandings of  sexual identity, a particular  national literature  and history. Such  topics will frequently bring questions of  gender and  sexuality  together; however students may also organize their   concentrations to  emphasize questions specifically related to gender or  to  sexuality if  they wish. Introductory and methodology courses in  the disciplines   appropriate to students' focus will help them  understand the principles   grounding such practices as historical  research, literary  interpretation, and  sociological analysis.Concentration OverviewThe concentration consists of 10 courses, 12 for honors  concentrators.Requirements:For further information, contact the director of Gender and Sexuality Studies:Drew Walker194 Meeting Street, Room 202401-863-3585 Drew_Walker@Brown.edu Stay Connected with Pembroke CenterProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

ShakesAfricana Studies“Africana Women’s Theatre as Activism: A Study of Sistren Theatre Collective, Jamaica and the Mothertongue Project, South Africa”The result of sixteen months of ethnographic research, Nicosia Shakes’ dissertation examines the activism of Sistren Theatre Collective in Jamaica and The Mothertongue Project in South Africa, two women-led organizations that use theatre to advocate for gender justice. Under the theoretical rubrics of Africana feminisms and activist aesthetics, Shakes analyzes how the two organizations transgress interlocking systems of gender, racial, sexual, and economic domination. She argues that Sistren and The Mothertongue exemplify the global interconnections between feminist activism and theory.

Koven analyzes how, why and with what consequences Stephen Hobhouse’s mother, Margaret Potter Hobhouse, single-handedly orchestrated the war’s most successful campaign waged to save her oldest son Stephen, from a martyr’s death as an absolutist pacifist prisoner of conscience in 1917. Stephen's story reveals when and why the wartime state "queered" conscience and recasts the post-war disenfranchisement of conscientious objectors as an attempt to keep the state straight.Koven's lecture supports our yearlong research seminar on "The Cultures of Pacifism." The 2017-18 Pembroke Research Seminar, "The Cultures of Pacifism", is being led by Leela Gandhi, John Hawkes Professor of the Humanities and English.The Pembroke Center invites applications from current Brown students, from any concentration or field, to apply for our research grants and internship. Undergraduate student grants are up to $1,000 and graduate student grants are up to $2,000.  Please apply using UFunds by Thursday, October 5, 2017.  Please see individual grant descriptions and guidelines.

The graduate certificate enables graduate students already enrolled in PhD programs at Brown to develop methodological and theoretical expertise and credentials in the interdisciplinary field of gender and sexuality studies while fulfilling the graduate requirements of their degree-granting department. It will give students the opportunity for advanced training in the field; provide them with specialized professional training in Gender and Sexuality Studies; and foster a community of scholars dedicated to the study of the intersections of gender and sexuality and other related methodologies, such as critical race studies, cultural studies, legal theory, psychoanalytic theory, as well as more traditional disciplinary methods. The Pembroke Center is pleased to announce the appointment of AneekaAneeka Henderson Henderson as the 2017-18 Affiliated Scholar in Residence in the Black Feminist Theory Project. Launched in 2016-17, the new visiting scholar initiative invites a black feminist theorist to campus annually to contribute to the Pembroke Center's research and work with students, fellows, and faculty.Professor Henderson is an assistant professor at Amherst College in the Sexuality, Women’s and Gender Studies department. She is a 2017-2018 AAUW American Postdoctoral Fellow and a 2017 Woodrow Wilson National Foundation Career Enhancement Fellow. At Amherst College, she teaches a wide range of courses exploring a mosaic of African American literature, art, music, and film, and her classes have been featured in Elle magazine as well as the New York Times.During her tenure, she will present a talk from her forthcoming book project, Wedding Bell Blues: Race and the Modern Marriage Plot, which examines ways in which contemporary music, film, and fiction negotiate and respond to complex neoliberal logics and black political nostalgia privileging marriage and family as supposed "cures" for inequality.Envisioned as a site of intellectual collaboration across disciplines, the aim of the the Black Feminist Theory Project is to enhance the visibility and accessibility of black feminist discourse on campus as a resource for faculty, students, and the surrounding community, while calling attention to ongoing activism and interventions at the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and public policy.  Learn more about the project.

Can we speak of a single methodology that ties GNSS together? How might  scholars work on gender and/or sexuality while respecting disciplinary  boundaries and training? We will start with the premise that studies in  gender and sexuality are tied together by critique that questions  foundational assumptions and takes account of its own position within a  given field of knowledge. By studying canonical theoretical texts  alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer  focus, we will investigate how critique operates and how standards of  evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines.

Students who have received a grade of NC in any concentration course  will not be admitted to the program save in exceptional circumstances. Candidates should discuss  their plans  with the program’s director during their sixth semester and  should submit their  honors proposal by the end of their sixth semester  or no later than the  beginning of their seventh semester.In  order to apply, a student should submit a 3-5 page proposal to  the program  director and have found an advisor appropriate to the  project. The proposal  should include the following:RequirementsHonors  concentrators take all of the courses required for a GNSS  concentrator, plus  GNSS 1970 and 1980 (thesis writing courses) during  their senior year. During the fall of senior year, honors  concentrators  must enroll in GNSS 1970 and 1990 (the Senior Seminar), and they  must  enroll in GNSS 1980 in the spring.  Their advisor will grade 1970 and  1980, while the Senior Seminar  instructor will grade 1990.  Students  may submit overlapping written work to GNSS 1970 and 1990, but  the  concentration expects students to conduct enough substantially distinct   work for each (e.g. course readings, presentations, and peer review in  Senior  seminar and thesis outline, research, and additional writing in  1970) to  warrant credit for two courses.By  the end of the fall semester reading period, the student will  turn in a  significant piece of written work (typically one chapter, but  to be determined  in each case in consultation with the student’s  advisor). By that time, the  student will also have produced a  well-developed, detailed outline or otherwise  have a substantial  framing for the overall project, as well as have significant  research  completed. The advisor  will submit a brief progress report on the  status of the thesis to the  concentration director at the end of the  fall semester.A  full draft of the thesis must be submitted to the advisor and  reader by  mid-March. The completed thesis must be submitted to the  advisor and second  reader by mid-April. If the advisor and second  reader deem the thesis to be of  superior quality, the candidate will be  awarded the designation of Honors in  Gender and Sexuality Studies. If  the readers judge the thesis acceptable but  not of honors caliber, the  student will receive credit for the full  two-semesters of work.  Role of Thesis Advisors and ReadersAt the beginning of the fall semester, students should discuss   expectations for regular meetings, written work, and deadlines with  their  advisor. A second reader for the thesis must be in place no later  than the end  of the student’s seventh semester. The second reader’s  role is to provide  supplementary guidance and feedback on the student’s  research and writing, the  extent of which will be individually  determined. Both the primary advisor and  the secondary reader will read  the final version of the thesis and submit  written feedback to the  concentration and the student.Thesis advisors should:Thesis readers should:Useful Writing and Editing Tools for Honors Thesis WritersStay Connected with Pembroke CenterProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
