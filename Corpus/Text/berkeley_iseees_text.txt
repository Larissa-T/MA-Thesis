The program helps its affiliated faculty and graduate students take advantage of the many new opportunities for innovative research on the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe by awarding fellowships, language training grants, and dissertation fellowships; sponsoring new courses on understudied topics; and hosting visiting scholars. BPS organizes conferences, workshops, graduate student colloquia, and lectures by faculty and visiting speakersThe Armenian Studies Program was founded in 1994 by two endowments: the William Saroyan Endowment for a Visiting Professor in Armenian Studies and the Krouzian Study Center Endowment. ISEEES helps administer the program and sits on the Advisory Committee.The Case-UC Berkeley Field Project was established in 2006 by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York to bring scholars at Centers for Advanced Studies and Education (CASE) universities in the Russian Federation to UC Berkeley in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Starting Fall 2009, the project will invite scholars from the South Caucasus in collaboration with the Caucasus Research Resource Centers (CRRC).The Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies and the Institute of European Studies at the University of California, Berkeley are pleased to announce the establishment of a new European Union Center of Excellence at UC Berkeley. A joint effort of these two Institutes, the EU Center is funded for three years with a €300,000 grant from the European Commission in partnership with these Institutes and is working in cooperation with the School of Public Health, the Institute of Governmental Studies, the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, and the Boalt Hall School of Law.
