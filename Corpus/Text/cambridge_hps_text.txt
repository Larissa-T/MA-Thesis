Fees at the overseas rate will not be provided. Awards enable scholars to undertake up to three years of full-time research on a history, philosophy or ethics of medicine topic leading to a doctoral degree. Strong preference is given to applicants intending to make a long-term academic career in the subject.Applicants should hold a Master's in medical humanities or a Master's with strong emphasis on medical humanities. (If specialist language skills are essential to undertake the research, a Master's in the language required may be acceptable.) The proposed project must fall within the history, philosophy or ethics of medicine, broadly understood. If you are not sure whether or not your interest falls within the scheme, you are strongly advised to discuss it with a prospective supervisor. The application must be sponsored by a senior member of the Department, who would supervise the student if an award were made, and must be submitted through the Department. Prospective applicants should note that only a very small number of doctoral studentships is awarded each year and that competition for them is intense.The Department is responsible for nominating applicants. If you would like to be nominated, please contact the Department no later than 4 January 2018 and enter 'Wellcome Doctoral Studentship' in the funding application section of the Applicant Portal.Further information about Wellcome Doctoral StudentshipsThe British Society for the Philosophy of Science offers one PhD scholarship each year.The British Society for the History of Science offers up to four bursaries each year to support students taking a master's degree.The Cambridge Philosophical Society awards research studentships, either to provide for the continuation of an exceptionally promising piece of research beyond the usual standard of the PhD, or to allow extra time for the completion of a PhD thesis which has been delayed by circumstances outside the applicant's control. Applicants must be fellows of the Society of at least one year's standing.The Royal Historical Society offers a number of research grants for those undertaking postgraduate research. Funds are available to subsidise attendance at conferences and training courses, and to help defray the costs of archival visits.The Department of History and Philosophy of Science will consider applications for PhD completion grants of up to £2,500 from PhD students registered in the Department. Students should apply by 1 October, just before they start their 10th term, providing a PhD submission plan that includes an outline of the thesis and estimated completion date. The application should also include a letter of support from the PhD supervisor.Graduate students in the Department can apply for travel or research expenses grants of up to £150 a year to help with the cost of conducting research on their dissertation. These travel grants are primarily aimed at PhD students but are sometimes available to support MPhil students. Please send an email to the Department's administrative staff – in advance of any financial commitment being made – to ask for permission to use these funds. Once you have received confirmation you can claim reimbursement by submitting an expenses claim form with receipts. Funding for research expenses and/or travel is sometimes available through Colleges, so students should check with their College before applying for this funding.Graduate students in the Department can apply for up to £150 a year to help with the cost of travel to conferences where they are giving a paper (not for attendance only).

They get to work closely with leading academics in the Department and the University at large. The sheer number and diversity of potential supervisors means that students can find experts on most areas of history and philosophy of science and medicine. These experts then work with each student individually, guiding them in honing their research topics, finding the right literature to engage, formulating an argument, and perfecting their writing.There is a great deal of flexibility about the topics of the essays and the dissertation. This room for independent growth in different directions regularly gathers praise from our students and distinguishes our programme from those at other universities. There are no courses or modules to complete, all assessment is based on submitted writing. Some students come with a specific list of topics and work on them throughout the year, others adjust or completely change their plans. Some specialise right away in either history (of a period or of a science), or philosophy. Others mix and match, trying out different skills in each piece of submitted work. Many of our students research objects in the Whipple Museum of History of Science, making discoveries and publishing their work afterwards.Whatever their path, students interact with members of the Department – academics, PhD students, postdocs, visitors – in an intense and packed schedule of talks, lectures, seminars, reading groups and supervisions. In these interactions students get a great deal of feedback on their writing and acquire a broad set of skills for how to be an academic researcher, writer and colleague. The 15,000-word dissertation is the culmination of the year. It allows students to explore a topic in depth and to build an extended argument. This piece of work, closely and thoroughly guided by a specially appointed and supremely qualified supervisor, often becomes the basis of a PhD thesis or academic article. By the end of their time in our programme, students have a good idea about their own future interests and the best way to realise their individual talents and newly acquired skills either within our field or outside it.If you are currently a Cambridge undergraduate student you may want to apply to take the HPS Part III course rather than the MPhil. However, you can apply for the MPhil if you prefer, or you can apply for both and decide later which course to take.Main image: Six editions of Charles Darwin's Origin of SpeciesImage credit: Wellcome Library, London

          EU Questions and AnswersHow will the University of Cambridge be affected by the UK leaving the European Union?© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeThe substantial, focused and independent theses that students write in history and philosophy of science help shape the future of scholarship in many different ways; and contributing to the development of knowledge in the University of Cambridge is a particularly rich and rewarding experience.Working closely with a doctoral supervisor and advisor (usually both from the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, sometimes from other departments in the University), students will have the benefit of expert guidance and close consultation with experienced researchers in articulating, developing and presenting their own research. Usually that means meeting several times a term, often to discuss an outline, consider research findings or go over a chapter. Consistent review and attentive feedback are integral to the supervisory relationship built up over time.Most students will have considered the research profiles and international reputations of our Department members in preparing an application to undertake doctoral studies here (it is often good to contact individuals directly). But the academic and social perspectives offered by joining a thriving research community are also invaluable. With around 45 doctoral students at any one time, a strong cohort of MPhil and Part III students each year, and postdoctoral researchers as well as Teaching Officers, the intellectual life of the Department is exceptionally strong. Sometimes you might wonder when you'll get time for your research or writing, for life in Cambridge has its seasons. Thriving reading groups, working groups and seminars provide a focus and in some cases allow scope for students to help set the agenda and present their own work amongst peers. Latin Therapy, the Cabinet of Natural History, and the reading group in philosophy and history of physics provide just a few examples of the kind of groups that meet on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Students are also supported with close attention paid to methodological development, research skills and career advice throughout their studies.Most PhD students move from taking advantage of the learning opportunities provided in Cambridge to developing their own teaching skills by supervising appropriate courses. Some might also contribute to research and displays oriented around the holdings of the Whipple Museum of the History of Science. Students are also encouraged to participate in professional conferences and begin publishing their work. The Department's Whipple Library is an unparalleled specialist library in history and philosophy of science and medicine, while the University Library and College and department libraries provide access to archival and documentary resources invaluable for research on the sciences; for some students these might provide as strong a reason as individual Department members for studying here. Funding support is excellent also; whether applying from a Cambridge Part III, MPhil or from elsewhere, candidates should prepare appropriately and note deadlines for scholarships such as Gates Cambridge, Cambridge Trust and AHRC. The Department also has some funds at its own disposal. In addition to offering Rausing and Williamson Studentships it offers financial support for student research (as do many Colleges).Cambridge offers PhD students unusually valuable teaching experience through the chance to give supervisions (tutorials) for undergraduates taking History and Philosophy of Science courses. PhD students are paid by the Colleges for this service. The University and the Department provide training in supervising undergraduates.Main image: Crocodile carving by Eric Gill on the Mond Building, where there is work space for HPS PhD students
          EU Questions and AnswersHow will the University of Cambridge be affected by the UK leaving the European Union?© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeThe PhD in History and Philosophy of Science is now offered as a part-time degree.It is normally expected that applicants for the part-time PhD would be employed in a field related to HPS. Part-time students are also expected to play a full role in the life of the Department, for example via regular attendance at reading groups and seminars.Most of the requirements for admission to part-time PhD studies, as well as regulations governing the degree, are the same as for the full-time PhD. Supervisors are appointed in the same way, and every part-time PhD student must be a member of a College.However, there are a number of differences and special requirements.It is normally expected that part-time PhD applicants would have taken the Department's MPhil or Part III course and achieved a first class pass.For the part-time PhD the minimum research requirement is fifteen terms (i.e. five years). This is the total number of terms required to complete the PhD. Formal induction takes place in the first week of Michaelmas Term.There are no residence requirements for part-time degrees at Cambridge but there are minimum attendance requirements. The PhD is a part-time degree rather than a distance learning degree. Applicants are asked to confirm that these requirements do not conflict with their external commitments and that they will live close enough to Cambridge to make their participation in the course feasible. Overseas applicants need to provide evidence that they have received permission to remain in the UK for the minimum period required to complete the degree. The Board of Graduate Studies can advise on this and related matters.The total University Composition Fee for the degree is the same, whether taken by the full-time or the part-time route. In practice, this normally means that 60% of the full-time fee is charged for each term of registration as a part-time student. College fees are charged on the same basis.When completing the online application form, applicants should give their reasons for choosing part-time study.All applicants for the part-time PhD must attend an admission interview. Applicants will be advised when, where and how this interview will be conducted once their application for admission has been assessed.Employed applicants should provide a letter from their employer stating that they will be allowed time off to attend the University, as required, for the whole duration of their course. If research for the degree is to be conducted in the workplace, applicants must agree this with their employer and provide evidence of this consent in their application. The Department will need to assure itself that the supervisor will be granted reasonable access to the workplace on request.Employed applicants should note that arrangements for intellectual property rights must be agreed in advance. Applicants must ensure that their employer reads this page as well as the information on the Board of Graduate Studies website relating to this issue.If the employer is not asserting any rights in the intellectual property created in the course of the research, a statement to this effect must be provided in writing within the application. Generally, this is expected to be the case where the employer is neither paying for the time of study nor contributing to fees. In the absence of any claim on the intellectual property by the employer, the position on intellectual property is identical to that of a full-time PhD student. More information on this is available on the Board of Graduate Studies website.If the employer is claiming rights in the intellectual property, the applicant and the employer must sign a short agreement which, among other things, confirms the level of any sponsorship by the employer and also sets out the position on intellectual property. This is administered through the University's Research Operations Office. While the employer may wish to retain ownership in any intellectual property created by the student, the University will also want to ensure that regard is given to the intellectual property rights in any contributions from the supervisor or other members of the University, as well as its obligations to external sponsors. The University will also wish to make sure that the employer cannot restrict the use or exploitation of the student's share in any collaborative project in which the student takes part.Candidates must produce a financial guarantee, or proof of means confirmed by a bank manager or other appropriate person, to cover at least the fees. The Board of Graduate Studies requires a guarantee based on capital for the fees element, but maintenance costs can be covered from various sources including income from the student's employment or from a partner. The Board of Graduate Studies does not usually entertain requests for assistance with maintenance in case of hardship.Although the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funds part-time students, part-time awards provide only 50% of the full-time rate of tuition fees. This may cause difficulties since the University charges part-time students 60% of the full-time rate.At the end of each calendar year (both before and after registration), the student and supervisor are required to meet to consider a brief but formal progress paper prepared by the student.The registration of part-time PhD students is the same as for full-time students except in the scheduling. Part-time students are required to undergo a registration exercise by the end of the fifth term if possible, and certainly by the end of the seventh term.Registration and submission dates are based on the minimum research requirement of the PhD, which is three years of full-time research or five years of part-time research.Where exemption is sought for a previous qualification, the maximum number of terms for which exemption can be allowed is five terms, part-time, at the recommendation of the Degree Committee. Exemptions are normally applied for when a candidate is near completion and knows how many terms of research are required to complete the work. Early submission from part-time students who have no grounds for an exemption but who have been able to devote more time to their research than expected under the scheme is not permitted unless the full fee for the five-year minimum research period has been paid.Transfer of registration status is permitted once only in either direction (except in the case of applications for leave to work away) providing the student is still within the minimum research requirement. Transfers are not normally permitted after the end of the period for which the student is paying fees nor as a means of avoiding the original submission deadline. Transfer from full-time to part-time status is considered by the Degree Committee on a case-by-case basis and may be subject to the same restrictions as apply to entry to the part-time PhD.

          EU Questions and AnswersHow will the University of Cambridge be affected by the UK leaving the European Union?© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeHistory and philosophy of science offer powerful approaches to interpreting knowledge. The Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge is the largest institution of its kind in the UK and has an outstanding international reputation for teaching and research. Human and material resources are excellent.Specialist staff teach a wide range of subjects across the history, philosophy and sociology of the sciences and medicine. The environment is exemplary in the number of externally-funded research groups, the lively community of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and the active programme of research seminars and reading groups. HPS also has close links to other university institutions across the medical, natural and social sciences, the arts and the humanities, including through the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities, and to the Needham Research Institute, the leading Western centre for the history of science, technology and medicine in East Asia.Located in the heart of Cambridge, the Department is centred on the Whipple Museum, a world-class collection of scientific instruments, and the Whipple Library, the largest specialist library in history and philosophy of science and medicine in the UK. The holdings of this and the other Cambridge libraries, including the University Library, are among the richest in the world.The pass rate in all courses approaches 100%, and in recent years about 80% of successful doctoral students have taken posts in the field of HPS. Students go on to a wide range of careers, from academic work in universities, museums and libraries to science journalism and consultancy.PhD placement recordThe Department has a long and distinguished tradition in history of medicine and is a major centre of teaching and research in the field. Expertise in medical history covers an exceptionally wide range, from antiquity to the present, from the medieval universities to the postwar laboratory sciences, from anatomy to psychoanalysis. Students have the opportunity both to focus on history of medicine, and to take advantage of intellectual exchange with colleagues in related areas.A lively programme of research seminars and reading groups makes the Department a hive of intellectual activity. In addition to the weekly departmental seminar, there are regular specialist research seminars and reading groups on history of medicine, history of natural history, 20th-century science, philosophy of science, philosophy and history of physics, philosophy of psychology, and science and literature. Regular workshops allow graduate students to present and discuss work in progress.Students are entitled to attend any undergraduate lectures in the University.Cambridge has excellent library resources for history and philosophy of science and medicine. The Department's own Whipple Library was founded on Robert S Whipple's collection of rare scientific books and includes over 10,000 such volumes, some dating back to the 15th century.The University Library is entitled to a copy of every print publication from the UK and Ireland. It has over 8 million books and journals, among them many early printed books. Manuscripts include the papers of Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, George Stokes, JJ Thomson and Ernest Rutherford, and of major scientific institutions in the University. Other departmental and faculty libraries and the College libraries house many valuable resources.The Department is unusual in having teaching programmes connected to a world-class collection of scientific instruments, models and books – the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, the gift of RS Whipple to the University in 1944. Instruments of astronomy, navigation, surveying, drawing and calculating are well represented in the collection, as are sundials, mathematical instruments and early electrical apparatus.Students are actively encouraged to work with objects in the Whipple Museum. Graduate students have the opportunity to produce case studies to display their current research.Several other University museums are also important resources for studies in history of science, including the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.The University Language Centre offers courses in 140 modern languages at basic and intermediate levels. Latin and Greek courses are offered by the Faculty of Classics. Several departments offer palaeography courses. (You may need to sign up early for some of these.)The Department has its own informal reading groups for Latin and Greek, which help beginners and experts with translations.
          EU Questions and AnswersHow will the University of Cambridge be affected by the UK leaving the European Union?© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeHistory and Philosophy of Science is available as an option for students in their second, third and fourth year at Cambridge.On these pages you will find an introduction to the subject, answers to some frequently asked questions, and an outline of the different routes into HPS.For information about applying to Cambridge, please see the University's Undergraduate Admissions website.I enjoyed every minute of working in this friendly, supportive and vibrant department. HPS has something for everyone and I thoroughly recommend it.More comments from our students© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeWhen can I study History and Philosophy of Science?I'm thinking about taking Biological and Biomedical Sciences for Part II. Can I study HPS as part of this course?Yes, we offer three single-paper options to students taking the NST Part II course in Biological and Biomedical Sciences.Can I take the full-time HPS Part II or Part III course if I'm not a Natural Sciences student?Yes, but you will need to switch to the Natural Sciences Tripos. You should ask your Director of Studies about the procedure for doing this.Can I study HPS Part II if I didn't take HPS Part IB?Yes, HPS Part II is open to students who have not taken HPS Part IB.How do I apply to take HPS Part IB or Part II? Do I need to fill in a form?There is no application form; you just need to register your choice on CamSIS.Is there a limit on the number of students who can take HPS?There is no limit on the number of students who can take the HPS Part IB option, but we have a limit of 40 for HPS Part II and 12 for Part III.What if HPS Part II is oversubscribed? How do you decide which students to take?If you have taken HPS Part IB, we will make our decision on your performance in the HPS exams. If you have not taken HPS Part IB, we will look at your exam results, but we may also ask you to write a short statement that describes your academic background to date and explains why you want to take HPS Part II. We will contact you in mid-June to let you know if you have a place on the course.And what if HPS Part III is oversubscribed? How do you decide which students to take?We will look at your exam results and your statement of interests. We may also invite you to an interview.I'm not used to writing essays. Will I find HPS too difficult?Essay writing – structuring arguments clearly and effectively – is an important part of what the courses are about. But we realise that most students coming to HPS have not written a connected piece of prose in a long time, so our supervisors are always ready to give plenty of advice on techniques for effective composition.Main image: Ptolemaic armillary sphere by Richard Glynne, c. 1715.

(Wh.0784)Image credit: Whipple Museum of the History of Science, University of Cambridge© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeTechnology, medicine and the sciences shape and dominate much of modern life. Many get specialist training in these fields. Even more people live in a world where the results of scientific inquiry and technical programmes matter. The challenges of learning and applying scientific techniques and principles raise fundamental and exciting questions about our ways of understanding the world.It is crucial that as citizens we are as well equipped as possible to understand and debate how these enterprises work and what they mean. We need to know how the sciences achieved their position in our society. We must be able to make sense of the processes of scientific knowledge, technological projects and medical strategies. We should be able to see how and why these enterprises exert their powers and how they are trusted, contested and changed.The courses offered by the Department of History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) furnish resources to achieve this. Students are trained to employ techniques from history, philosophy and the social sciences. Students with a background in natural sciences or medicine learn how to put their work into its wider context and to ask more fundamental questions about their approach and achievement. Those from history, philosophy and the social sciences learn more about the essential roles and developments of the sciences, medicine and technology in the world. With these techniques, they are taught how to follow the ways in which sciences, technology and medicine changed and how to appreciate the way they function now.Many of the most urgent public problems facing us now rely on very basic claims about how we get reliable knowledge and whom we should trust. Fraught debates about the causes of climate change or the safety of genetically modified foods, about the validity of techniques drawn from complementary medicine or the authority of evolutionary explanations of human behaviour, all involve deep questions about the character of dependable knowledge.Courses in HPS help students think about these questions as they occur in the major debates around the sciences. Such controversies often call on citizens to ask about the truth of the claims made by scientists, medical practitioners or technologists. We can examine whether the sciences are in fact in the business of providing certain truths about the world, or whether, instead, their task is just to generate better predictions. Many current conflicts, whether in health care or engineering, in criminology or ecology, involve assertions and assumptions about the underlying causes of apparently evident effects. So as scientists and citizens we need to understand the diverse ways in which causation works. We also inquire about how different authorities have given reasons to trust what scientists say. This requires us to figure out the conditions for accepting some claim about nature and to see how persuasion works. Often, we rely on what others tell us. What we believe may well be contradicted by others' accounts. HPS programmes offer many fascinating approaches to understanding what is going on in such cases.So we depend on good pictures of the sources and methods by which we find out about the world. For a long time, the sciences have been taken to be the model of secure knowledge. Students in HPS learn how to explore such models and how they have changed. These changes have taken place in surprising and provocative ways. HPS courses study models of knowledge across many societies and periods. There are many more systems of making knowledge than those pursued in modern technological societies. So students can learn about the knowledge systems and practical enterprises of other cultures, including classical China, ancient Mesopotamia or medieval Christendom. One vital aim is to explore the world-views of other communities, to make sense of approaches very different from those of industrial societies. Students also examine how these systems acquire their impressive power to act in the world. This means we have to ask why it is believed that the sciences are in fact such a potent way of understanding the world around us.The task of scientific understanding has been, and is now, achieved through a range of very contrasting approaches. These include experiment and measurement, meditation and observation, classification and artistry. In different places and at different times highly variable methods have been put to work to establish how nature works and to manage and manipulate it. The purposes that guide human communities in the development of natural knowledge and of sophisticated techniques are also highly disparate. It makes a difference if nature is seen as a result of divine creation or instead as a vast, self-sustaining machine. It also makes a difference if the trustworthy interpreters of nature are treated as priests or as engineers.So one of the most important questions about the sciences is their relation with the wider social system. Technologies and sciences in the modern world rely on massive networks of social organisation and communal enterprise. One way of thinking about the sciences is to treat them as institutions, then study the groups that make knowledge work, check its validity, train its practitioners and give it value. HPS courses help students learn how to apply this approach to the sciences, to medicine and to technology. These courses let students debate the urgent questions of the collective and individual character of reliable knowledge and effective technique.The same kinds of fascinating and important issues arise in medical experience. Different peoples give very contrasting senses to the principal events of human life and death. Students of HPS explore how the medicalisation of these events was effected. They study the relations between notions of well-being and health, social life and individual fate, as models of medical intervention and of the human body have been contested, revised and developed. There have been close connexions between attitudes to technologies and to medical strategies. These have shaped the status of physicians and health carers, they matter to the condition of men and women in society and to the imagination of what counts as a good life. Courses in HPS allow students to investigate these fundamental social, ethical and historical problems and to learn how to analyse the condition of the biomedical world and its meanings.The HPS department offers its students the chance to gain important insights about the condition of the sciences, of technology and of medicine. It also trains them in techniques of interpretation and argument, communication and critical analysis. These are indispensable skills throughout the Tripos. They are also increasingly valuable in an epoch when social, biomedical and environmental transformations pose such major challenges to public knowledge and expert authority. Graduates from the Department have successfully won places as researchers and activists, science educators and journalists, exhibition curators and media professionals and experts in science and technology policy.

The course explores the historical, philosophical and social dimensions of the sciences, the ways in which the sciences are shaped by other aspects of social and economic life, and the role of scientists in public debate.Examples are drawn from many different disciplines, over a period extending from the Renaissance to the present day: from early astronomy, alchemy and natural philosophy, to the atomic bomb and the discovery of DNA. We examine questions about how theories are tested and change, and about the nature of causation, laws and scientific explanation. The course also considers whether science provides an increasingly accurate account of a largely unobservable world.No previous experience in history or philosophy is expected; the lectures and basic reading provide the necessary background.In addition to encouraging a broad perspective on the sciences, the course develops skills of writing, reading and critical thinking. These skills are essential if you are to make effective use of your other Tripos options.HPS Part IB is also available as an option for students taking Part IIA of the Human, Social and Political Sciences Tripos (HSPS) and the Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Tripos (PBS). These students choose only one paper: History of Science (shown on CamSIS as HPS1) or Philosophy of Science (HPS2). Natural Sciences Tripos students take both papers.Main image: A replica of Watson and Crick's DNA model© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeThe Part II course in History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) gives students an insight into the historical development of science, medicine and technology. It addresses questions about the nature of scientific knowledge, and critically examines the social authority given to scientific expertise. It thus provides essential intellectual resources for understanding some of the most important aspects of modern society and culture.This is a full-time Part II course in the Natural Sciences Tripos. We also offer single-paper options as part of the NST Part II course in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Part IIB of the Human, Social and Political Sciences Tripos, and Part IIB of the Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Tripos.There are two alternative ways of designing your HPS Part II programme.Option A consists of:Option B consists of:Each examination paper counts for 20%, the two primary source essays for 20% and the dissertation (in Option A) for 20% of the overall mark. This means that Option A is 40% coursework and Option B is 20% coursework.Students choose from the following list of papers. Any combination of papers will provide a very broad exposure to the field of history and philosophy of science and medicine and will fully meet the course aims and objectives.All students write two extended essays (up to 3,000 words), each focused on an assigned primary source. During Michaelmas Term there will be six series of primary source seminars, each made up of four seminars. Students should attend four series of seminars. They then choose two sources on which to write their essays.The prescribed sources for 2017–18 are as follows:This part of the course – which is only for students taking Option A – gives students the chance to explore in depth a topic that really interests them. The dissertation is a substantial piece of original work (up to 12,000 words). Students make short presentations on their dissertation work in dissertation seminars in Lent Term.All papers are supported by supervisions; we recommend that students write 6–8 supervision essays per paper.Main image: Detail from Edward Sherburne, The sphere of Marcus Manilius made an English poem, 1675Image credit: Whipple Library, University of Cambridge© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeThe Department's Part III course is conducted by means of supervisions and seminars. Students are also encouraged to attend some of the wide range of relevant lectures offered in the Department and elsewhere in the University.The Part III course requires students to submit:Work for each essay and the dissertation will be separately supervised by senior members and associates of the Department.Part III students are encouraged to explore a range of different topics, balancing them so that they are both relevant to their interests and also span the subject of History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science, Technology and Medicine. Discussions between the Part III Manager and each student are intended to ensure that all students follow an appropriate, individualised and sufficiently broad course of study; the formal approval of topics of essays and dissertation by the Degree Committee is intended to provide oversight of this procedure.The first of these two essays is a Research Paper on a topic chosen in discussion with a supervisor in the first weeks of Michaelmas Term. For this essay, students are encouraged to undertake original research in any area within the History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science, Technology and Medicine. The topic of the essay must be submitted for approval in early November. It is due for submission at the end of Michaelmas Term.The second 5,000-word essay is a Critical Literature Review on a topic chosen in discussion with a supervisor. The topic of the essay must be submitted for approval at the end of Michaelmas Term. It is due for submission at the end of Lent Term (i.e. mid-March).Every Part III student should attend regularly the Part III seminar, which meets on Wednesdays during term at 3pm. During the first term, and at the beginning of the second term, these seminars are led by different senior members of the Department, and focus on selected readings in history, philosophy and sociology of science, technology and medicine. In addition to reading the texts prescribed for each seminar and discussing them in the seminar, students will be offered up to five supervisions with senior members or associates of the Department on the seminar readings, principally during Michaelmas Term, and will write a number of brief essays for discussion in supervision. In Lent Term, a list of subjects will be published relating to the topics covered in the Part III seminar. Students will be asked to choose two topics from this list on which to write the two essays of 2,500 words, which will be submitted by the half-way point (the division, i.e. mid-February) of Lent Term.Students are permitted to write their dissertation in the same general area as one of their essays. In such cases, the dissertation and essay have to address different questions, and the dissertation must give evidence of a substantial new research effort. Students may take the opportunity of working on the Critical Literature Review to make an initial exploration of the important questions and themes in the field in which they intend to write their dissertation. The topic of the dissertation must be submitted for approval at the end of February.The Part III programme is administered by a senior member of staff, the Part III Manager, who meets all new Part III students as a group in early October, then sees each of the students individually to discuss their proposed essay and dissertation topics. The Manager is responsible for finding appropriate supervisors for each of these topics; the supervisors are then responsible for helping the student do the research and writing needed for the essays and the dissertation. Students will see each of their supervisors on a very regular basis; the Part III Manager sees each student at regular intervals during the year to discuss progress and offer help and advice. Supervisions are designed to provide students with the opportunity to set their own agenda for their studies. The supervisor's job is to support the student's research, not to grade their work – supervisors are formally excluded from the examination process.If problems arise with research or supervision, students should talk to their supervisors, or to the Part III Manager, or to the Secretary of the Degree Committee. The Director of Graduate Studies will be happy to advise Part III students planning to go on to PhD research. All Part III students must be resident in Cambridge throughout the duration of the course.The Part III seminar is the core teaching resource for the course. During the second half of the second term, and during the third term, the seminars provide opportunities for Part III students to present their own work. Students are also strongly encouraged to attend the Departmental Seminar and other seminars, workshops and reading groups arranged regularly by the Department. Graduate training workshops, which run throughout the academic year, focus on key research, presentation, publication and employment skills.Part III students are also strongly encouraged to attend some of the HPS Part II lectures for the papers they did not take the previous year, as well as relevant lectures and seminars held in other departments and faculties in the University. The Part III Manager and the supervisors will help indicate the lectures and seminars close to each student's interests.Students should email their application to hpshod@hermes.cam.ac.uk by 16 March 2018. Applications should consist of the following:For those who have taken HPS Part II: the Department will normally expect students to obtain a 2:1 in their Part II exams.For those who have not taken HPS Part II: the Department considers applications on a case-by-case basis. Students will normally be expected to obtain a high 2:1 in their Part II exams, and may be interviewed by a senior member of the Department.Although their results will be published at the end of the Part II, students going on to the Part III must not graduate after their third year exams and will receive their BA once they have completed the Part III course, along with their MSci (assuming satisfactory performance in the Part III). Any student who in June remains unsure about whether or not they will be going on to the Part III will still have the opportunity to graduate in July.There is a quota of 12 places for this course. If the course is oversubscribed, meeting the admissions criteria may not be sufficient to secure a place because if the number of applicants exceeds the quota there will be a ranking procedure. All plans to continue to HPS Part III must therefore be provisional until a place has been confirmed.A preliminary shortlist will be decided upon in Easter Term, but the final decision on who will be offered a place will not be taken until after the Part II tripos results are announced. Letters will then be sent to all students informing them of the decision and telling those who are offered places on the Part III course that they should ensure their Colleges withdraw their names from those who will graduate.The NST Committee has updated the entry requirements for Part III and any appeals for acceptance may in future be dealt with by the Applications Committee.Main image: Tintometer slides, Lovibond, c. 1910.

At the present time there is no upper limit; total numbers taking the course range from 65 to 100. NST students take both HPS Part IB papers – History of Science and Philosophy of Science – expect for students taking Part IB Physics who can chose a single paper.Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Tripos (PBS) and Human, Social and Political Sciences Tripos (HSPS): Students are able to take one of the two HPS Part IB papers as part of their Part IIA course: History of Science (HPS1) or Philosophy of Science (HPS2).More about HPS Part IBNST and other triposes: There is a quota of 40, and admission can be competitive. A Part II allocations meeting takes place in late June every year. Most of the places are filled at this point and to ensure a place students need to make their choices known on CamSIS.Our policy is to try to offer a Part II place to everyone who has taken HPS Part IB. A 2:1 is normally expected from other students. Tripos switchers who are underperforming are not admitted unless there is strong evidence that they will perform well in HPS. No place should be assumed without checking first.More about HPS Part IIBiological and Biomedical Sciences minor subjects: We welcome all students who wish to take one of our single-paper options: Philosophy and Ethics of Medicine, Early Medicine, or Modern Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.PBS and HSPS: PBS and HSPS Part IIB students can take one of the HPS Part II papers. PBS students can choose Philosophy of Science (Paper 5) or Modern Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. HSPS students can choose Philosophy of Science (Paper 5) or Ethics and Politics of Science, Technology and Medicine (Paper 6).More about single-paper optionsNST and other triposes: There is a quota of 12, and admission is competitive. Students must make an application to the Department by mid-March, and we make preliminary offers by the end of Easter Term. It is not necessary to have taken HPS Part II: we have had students from a variety of triposes, including English and History as well as NST.More about HPS Part IIIAll applicants must complete the online application form. The Director of Studies is expected to advise on potential areas of expertise, to support the student in identifying sources of financial support and, where opportunities arise, to liaise between the College and the Department to put together a viable funding package.More about graduate study© 2017 University of CambridgeDepartment of History and Philosophy of ScienceStudying at CambridgeWe asked some recent students to tell us about their experience of studying History and Philosophy of Science. Here are their responses.I came to Cambridge intending to be a physicist, but soon realised that I was more interested in the human aspects of science and the philosophical implications than the facts and theories themselves. Part IB HPS opened my eyes to a whole world of fascinating and diverse topics and introduced me to more critical and informed ways of thinking. I also enjoyed learning to communicate my own ideas and contribute to debates, something that I had never been able to do as an undergraduate in the sciences.Having enjoyed Part IB so much, I didn't hesitate to choose HPS at Part II. It wasn't an easy option, despite what many DOSs and other people think. The work load was challenging, but the intellectual rewards were immeasurable. Reading lots of books and writing essays were skills that I hadn't used much as a scientist, but it was surprisingly easy to adapt and I actually found it all very enjoyable. I chose a range of papers covering history, philosophy and sociology and every lecture course influenced the way I think about science and society. I've since gone on to do an MPhil in HPS and publish my own research in an academic journal, and I'm about to train as a science teacher, so my HPS background will be more valuable than ever. I enjoyed every minute of working in this friendly, supportive and vibrant department. HPS has something for everyone and I thoroughly recommend it."As a NatSci I took physical sciences in my first year but found the excessive detail a little tedious. When I heard about HPS IB I knew that it had the potential to satisfy my interest in 'the big questions'. It has certainly delivered. At IB I took HPS, maths and pscyhology, and they worked really well together as they were a nice mix of types of thinking. HPS IB was a breath of fresh air offering both content and learning methods that I had never really encountered before. The increased freedom afforded, and the discipline required by such a subject was liberating and valuable. IB interested me sufficiently that I went on to take the philosophical papers at Part II.Part II HPS improved upon what I had enjoyed most at IB – fascinating yet flexible content and much more independent learning, as well as an opportunity, with the dissertation, to try your hand at research. There is such a wide set of options on offer that anyone with a deeper interest in science will find plenty to keep them engrossed, and the supervisors are all really personable and helpful. It really is an enjoyable department to be a part of – big enough to be exciting, small enough to be personal. I have learnt valuable study skills, advanced my self-discipline and met some fascinating people. Now entering my third year of a PhD in the philosophy of science I am very glad I took the chance offered at IB to try something new."...and many people probably don't realise (as I didn't) just how many subject matters, types of history, places and spaces fall under the HPS umbrella. HPS laps the boundaries of so many other subjects, not just the obvious ones but literature, psychology, classics, law... the list goes on. It is a privilege to study a course like this for Part II and, whilst it does not make you omniscient, it means you can stick your nose into friends' subjects and attempt to sound vaguely knowledgeable in some areas. It also means that you will invariably find something that really grips your imagination and you can tailor your supervisions, coursework and exam revision around things that genuinely interest you.Although I chose this Part II for the history papers, my greatest challenge and probably therefore the most rewarding part of the course for me was the History and Philosophy of Mind paper. I found this subject fascinating, a nightmare to write essays on, but brilliant to talk about to all and sundry. Most of the topics were completely alien to me, specifically the philosophy of mind modules, and whilst flummoxed at first, by the end of the year I was totally engaged. One of the brilliant aspects of a one-year course like this is the opportunity to discover new subjects of study. At the beginning of the year I was also daunted by the dissertation but this was far more rewarding than I expected and I would urge you not to let the thought of the dissertation put you off.The Department is small and very friendly; the teaching staff particularly are highly approachable. The size of the Department means that in general the quality of teaching is high and supervisors will take an individual interest in you and your work, but it does also mean that you are pretty conspicuous if trying to sneak into a lecture late. There are also numerous, numerous HPS related seminars and talks hosted by the Department or in Cambridge, and these are an added bonus providing opportunities either to go and listen to a subject of interest to you discussed in depth, or just to find out about something completely new."At that time I simply thought I would continue to study chemistry, and would somehow end up with a career related to science. But that all changed when, in my second term here, I discovered HPS. I remember I was asked to fill out a form for my college, stating my three IB subjects. I clicked around the University's website, and discovered the Department's page. I have to admit I knew next to nothing about the subject at the time. But I felt that I wanted a challenge, a change of environment and style of thinking, so I decided to investigate further. I visited the Department, a cosy haven hidden in Free School Lane, wandered around the Whipple Museum with its wonderful exhibits, and attended a few IB lectures. I decided to give HPS a shot, still not entirely sure what I was getting myself into. And suddenly I find myself in the third year of my PhD...The HPS courses are extremely enjoyable simply because they address questions which, I think, will at some point enter a NatSci's head. When I was doing a IA practical on Drosophila and inheritance, or playing around with Maxwell's equations, or learning about the physics behind the bomb, or looking up the Periodic Table... the questions which came up in my mind were: 'Well, how did they come up with this? What is the story behind the making of this piece of knowledge?' (a historical concern); 'Why should this experiment confirm this bit of theory?' (a philosophical concern); 'How do scientists, and the public, come to believe in what they believe?' (a sociological concern). One can either push these questions away and carry on as before – or they will continue to preoccupy one's mind, and HPS is the discipline that attempts to answer them. What also I love is the variety of courses on offer. At Part II, one can study everything from Greek and Chinese science, the history of alchemy, the Darwinian revolution, bioethics, the story of psychiatry, the 'war on cancer', the relationship between scientists and the public... all with their philosophical problems, historical concerns, and issues relevant to our thinking about the present, and the future. Intellectually, HPS is a deeply satisfying subject.Friends I made here have landed into all sorts of jobs after graduation; they have become management consultants, accountants, journalists, documentary makers, museum curators, civil servants, and specialists in public relations, marketing and advertising. Many of them are benefiting from the unique experience of having undergone training in both science and humanities. A small group from my Part II year decided to take on the MPhil, and some of us moved on to the PhD when we realised we could not get enough of HPS. These days, I spend a good deal of my time uncovering magazines from the 1920s and 30s, trying to learn something about the translation of scientific knowledge, in an excellent adventure which has taken me to archives, libraries and conferences in Paris, Barcelona, Heidelberg, Berlin and New York. I am about to go to Shanghai and Beijing for four months to do more research, and to meet more scholars deeply passionate about what they do. Choosing IB HPS turned out to be one of those best serendipities in life!"© 2017 University of Cambridge
