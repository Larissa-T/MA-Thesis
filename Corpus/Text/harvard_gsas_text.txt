    The Department of African and African American Studies offers graduate programs in the fields of African American studies and African studies. The Department of African and African American Studies offers a doctoral degree in African and African American studies, which identifies synergies in theory, concept and method across the African Diaspora. Given shared concerns around race, racism, slavery, colonialism, post-colonialism, modernity and other conceptual apparatuses for understanding Africa and the Americas, students are encouraged to think robustly about the similarities, differences and linkages within the African Diaspora. The program affords rigorous interdisciplinary training in the humanities and the social sciences, with a focus in a disciplinary field, leading to the PhD.Nearly all PhD recipients have secured academic or professional careers in a variety of departments in universities throughout the nation. They can be found in American studies, African and African American studies, English, history, history and literature, music, political science, religion, social studies, and women’s studies. They also make substantial contributions to society through careers outside of the academy. The program admits four or five students a year into a five- to six-year program. While there are no specific prerequisites, typically students either have undergraduate majors in African American studies or African studies, or have majors in fields such as anthropology, comparative literature, English, history, history of art, music, philosophy, sociology, and religious studies, and have done some undergraduate work in the field of African or African American studies. Additional information is available from the Department of African and African American Studies and specific program requirements are detailed in the GSAS Student Handbook. All applicants to the Department of African and African American Studies should include with their application a critical or scholarly paper of their most recent work of no longer than 20 pages.The fundamental rationale for a concentration in African American Studies is that there now exists a substantial body of scholarly writing on African American and Afro-Latin American social, cultural, economic, and political life and history, conducted by scholars with a primary training in a traditional discipline, who have drawn on the work of colleagues in other fields to enrich their work. This interdisciplinary corpus of scholarship is at the core of African American studies, and most serious work on African American literature, history, culture and social, economic, or political life proceeds with an awareness of this interdisciplinary background. There is, as a result, a fairly substantial tradition of writings and a lexicon of ideas that together define a core of knowledge in the field. Familiarity with this core at the graduate level is an important part of the training of those who work on these topics.Along with this background, there is also a good deal of work on the concept of race, which is clearly central to the field, and that can no longer be said to be rooted in a single primary discipline. It draws on anthropology, sociology and intellectual history, the history of science and philosophy, literary and cultural studies, and political science.These two corpora are substantial enough and of sufficient importance that training in them provides a significant component of the graduate education of a student who wishes to work in African American studies at the same time as acquiring the intellectual tools of a primary discipline.Our conception of the “American” in “African American” is capacious (including North, Central and South American contexts) not least because a full history of the African presence in the United States cannot be properly constructed without attention to relations among communities in many parts of the New World. There are many other reasons why this is intellectually necessary: a proper understanding of the concept of race, for example, must be comparative (and thus cross-national); and we are bound to acknowledge the complex role of economic, religious, and intellectual linkages among communities of African descent within the Americas, as well as their connections with Africa and with Europe. These general points can be illustrated by various iconic examples: Marcus Garvey, the founder of the largest African American mass political movement in the first half of this century was a Jamaican; Alexander Crummell, who was born in New York, was shaped by his experiences as one of the founders of the University of Liberia; the decolonization of Africa and the presence of African diplomats in New York at the United Nations affected the politics of the Civil Rights movement.It is this interdisciplinary, comparative, cross-national approach to African American subjects in the humanities and the social sciences that makes our PhD program unique. Students study these topics from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, participating in graduate seminars in anthropology, government, history, literature, and sociology, for example. Thus, they are able to ask and answer questions from a wider variety of perspectives than traditional disciplinary approaches allow. This interdisciplinary approach enables a student to produce richly contextualized analyses while retaining a principle focus within one discipline. The core seminar assures that students have familiarity with the essential social, political, economic and cultural background, and a body of established questions central to the field.African studies has existed as a field at the university level for almost 50 years, contributing rich insights and novel paradigms to the humanities and social sciences through its interdisciplinary approach and careful attention to history, culture and lived experience. Emerging at the time of Africa’s political independence, the field has matured over a period of monumental challenges in the continent’s quest for development facilitated by the resilience and creativity of African peoples. In the past five decades, paradigms have shifted in the study of Africa in developmental economics, understandings of state and society, ethnicity and identity, religion and daily life, environment and constructions of environmental sustainability, health, and the burden of disease. Since Harvard pioneered the study of Africa at the beginning of the 20th century, there are good intellectual and historical reasons for having a strong African Studies program here. The study of Africa is in fact already part of the literature and discourse of many disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Historians have long studied African history, ranging from pre-colonial studies drawing on both oral traditions and written sources to explore the colonial and post-colonial periods. In literature, music, and art, African creativity is of interest in terms of their central roles in African societies as well as their diasporic circulation and influence on expressive culture worldwide. For anthropology, sociology, and political science, Africa has provided major subjects of research and study as well as comparative data and theory. In economics, law, political science, public health, and medicine, Africa has contributed striking new data that has re-aligned thinking in these fields as well as provided grist for comparative studies.African studies incorporates concerns with many of the central issues and problems of present-day scholarship. The history of the continent, in particular the impact of the colonial period on indigenous peoples and polities, demands close attention as it constructed borders and boundaries of indigenous ethnic, religious, or national identities. Many disciplines have begun to recognize the importance of indigenous African knowledge systems and practices to the global discourse in areas of natural resources, environment, healing practices, spirituality, and cultural creativity. Work in African studies brings to the fore questions about well-worn categories such as tradition, modernization, westernization, and secularization.The graduate program emphasizes both the local and global dimensions of African studies, at once seeking to convey a broad understanding of African history and culture while addressing a wide array of peoples, languages, and societies past and present on the continent. The program also seeks to recognize important national and regional entities in Africa. The curriculum focuses on individuals and institutions important to Africa’s past and present as it explores the relationship of the continent to the wider world, including the historical African diaspora that emerged in the wake of the slave trade and the late 20th-century movement of African peoples after African independence.The Harvard Graduate Program in African Studies is interdisciplinary and comparative. In particular, it seeks to look closely at the ongoing dialogue between Africa and the West, most especially the American diaspora, both as historically constituted and as newly formed by waves of immigration in the late 20th century. It seeks both to train scholars across the disciplines and to produce individuals who will in the future contribute to the discussion of social, cultural, and economic development and growth on the African continent. It seeks to incorporate individuals from the widest range of disciplines and experiences, and to engage them with the larger African Studies community at Harvard. Our curriculum conveys a broad understanding of African history and culture while addressing a wide array of peoples, languages, and societies past and present on the continent and in the African/black diaspora. In this respect, we seek to grasp the African and African American experience in a single, unifying perspective that endows this experience with its full historical significance. Thus, our conception of the African diaspora extends beyond the Atlantic paradigm that has dominated academic and intellectual discourse concerned with the black experience, in order to project a larger, more comprehensive view that embraces the Indian Ocean, the Pacific area (Peru, Colombia) and the Trans-Saharan-Mediterranean.GRE General

    American Studies at Harvard offers a unique opportunity to explore the breadth and depth of the University’s offerings in all topics American, including the place of the United States in the wider hemisphere and world. The program's oversight committee consists of members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including African and African American studies, comparative literature,  economics, English, government, history, history of art and architecture, history and literature, history of science, music, romance languages and literatures, sociology, visual and environmental studies, and women, gender and sexuality studies. The program also is advised by faculty from Harvard's Divinity School, the Graduate School of Education, Harvard Kennedy School, and the Law School. What is American Studies? This is a question that our students ask, and answer anew, every day. We do not promote any particular definition of the field; indeed, the decentralized nature of our program inherently fosters new topics of study and catalyzes new interdisciplinary methods. We are structured as a program (not a department), which means that rather than maintain our own resident faculty, we support our students as they work with affiliated faculty mentors across the divisions and departments of the University. Our students are free to take courses and pursue dissertation projects with virtually any combination of mentors on campus, creating new constellations of expertise, and new approaches to scholarship, as they do so. Students gather as a full intellectual community in the American Studies Colloquium (two core courses, one taken in each of the first two years in the program), in multiple academic program events, and in innumerable informal settings.Given our large and diverse affiliated faculty, we are able to support an uncommonly broad array of projects. We have distinctive strengths in such areas as the study of early America, African and African American studies, Latino/a studies, gender studies, visual and material culture, food studies, environmental history, literary history, music history, religious studies, and the history of capitalism. The program has a strong record of admitting and supporting students from diverse backgrounds, and our placement record is equally strong, with many tenure-track positions among the varied professional trajectories.Although we are the oldest American studies program in the country, our true character is defined not by fixed tradition but by the continually evolving work of our students and faculty.Admissions RequirementsWe welcome applications from students with a wide variety of backgrounds and interests. When applying, you must include a writing sample, such as a term paper, senior thesis, or master’s essay.More information about our diversity efforts is available from the American Studies program and program requirements for the degree are detailed in the GSAS Student Handbook.GRE General

    Offering coursework and training leading to an AM in medical anthropology and the PhD in archaeology and social anthropologyThe Department of Anthropology offers coursework and training leading to the PhD in two principal fields of specialization—archaeology and social anthropology—that have their own programs of study and examination procedures. The department also offers an AM in medical anthropology.Degree offered: PhDThe graduate program in archaeology provides informed, critical examinations of core issues; comprehensive training in principal methods and theories of anthropologically-oriented archaeology; and direction and support for PhD candidates preparing for research and teaching positions in a wide variety of domains of archaeological practice.Students choose a primary area of specialization:In addition, they acquire a basic understanding of the archaeology of complex societies in both the Old and New Worlds as well as general knowledge of those aspects of ethnography, ethnology, and biological anthropology that have particular relevance to their areas of interest.Degree offered: PhDThe graduate program in social anthropology focuses on issues of globalism, ethnic violence, gender studies, “new” nationalisms, diaspora formation, transnationalism and local experience, medical anthropology, and the emerging cultures of cyberspace. Our mission is to develop new methodologies for an anthropology that tracks cultural developments in a global economy increasingly defined by the Internet and related technologies. Our graduate students (drawn from over 30 countries) expect to work in the worlds of academe, government, NGOs, law, medicine, and business.Knowing that material culture is a key element in the study of globalism and the new world economy, we work closely with staff from Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, who share our interests in redefining the study of popular culture, art, and the origins of industrial society. Research at the museum also makes it possible for us to maintain close ties to our departmental colleagues in the archaeology program.Degree offered: AMThe Department of Anthropology offers an MA in anthropology, with a specialty in medical anthropology. The program is intended to provide a basic education in medical anthropology for physicians or other health professions with clinical work experience and prior graduate work, and in exceptional cases, we may consider undergraduates who have superior backgrounds and are committed to careers in medicine or other health professions. The program can be completed in an intensive 12 months.In exceptional circumstances, the department may admit students who have a strong interest in pursuing graduate studies that combine archaeology and social anthropology. For more information, contact the graduate program administrator.Previous concentration in anthropology is not required, but some substantive engagement with the subject is expected of applicants. In addition to academic qualifications, admission decisions are based on the best possible fit between a student’s prospective research area and the current areas of research and teaching of department faculty. Students are expected to complete the program in 6 years.The graduate program social anthropology highly recommends that PhD applicants submit a writing sample (e.g., term paper or thesis).Prospective students are urged to apply for outside fellowships that offer tuition and stipend support during graduate school. These include the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships, Ford Foundation Fellowships, and the US Department of Education’s Jacob K. Javits Fellowships. Application deadlines for these fellowships are in the fall, well before Harvard’s admissions deadline. Eligible applicants are encouraged to investigate these funding opportunities early in the application season.Additional information about admissions requirements are available from the Department of Anthropology and specific program requirements are detailed in the GSAS Student Handbook.GRE General

    The Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures at Harvard is the only one of its kind in North America. The department offers training in the languages and traditions of several Celtic languages, and our PhD program requires that students master at least two Celtic languages—Irish and Welsh—in their early (medieval) forms and at least one in its modern form. The program aims to provide PhD candidates with a broad knowledge of the field of Celtic studies, its history, theory, and many diverse branches. We encourage our students to situate their study of Celtic literatures and oral traditions in the context of the history and material culture of the Celtic-speaking lands. The department is committed to interdisciplinary study and encourages PhD students to do coursework outside the department. Many of our students complete Secondary Fields in other departments or programs, such as Medieval Studies or Comparative Literature. The typical time to completion of the PhD in our department is six years.Our department is small and shares a strong sense of intellectual community. Students work closely with faculty and with one another, not only in courses but in independent Reading and Research modules, advising meetings, informal reading and conversation groups, and the GSAS Celtic Studies Research and Conference Workshop. The annual Harvard Celtic Colloquium, organized by the third-year PhD students with the assistance of the second-year students and the department administrator and faculty, is a three-day international conference that brings scholars from all over the world to discuss their research in many different branches of Celtic studies. Our program is also enriched by the contribution of speakers in the Mahindra Humanities Center Seminar on Celtic Literatures and Culture.The admissions committee assesses every application to the PhD program in Celtic individually and holistically. Students come into the program from different academic backgrounds, including English, History, and Classics, as well as Celtic or Medieval Studies. Some have earned Masters’ degrees prior to joining the program, and others come directly from their undergraduate studies. In addition to the requirements set by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, prospective applicants should take note of the following:Every application should include a 15—20-page sample of your academic writing. If you have not done formal work in Celtic studies, the writing sample should draw on your work in any field of literary or historical study. Should you wish to submit a writing sample in Irish, Welsh, or Scottish Gaelic, please include a sample of writing in English as well. The program requires students to demonstrate the ability to conduct research in Early Irish and Middle Welsh sources, and to achieve reading, speaking and writing competence in Modern Irish, Scottish Gaelic or Welsh. In addition, PhD candidates are required to demonstrate a reading knowledge of Latin, French and German. Because of these fairly extensive language requirements, an applicant with a background in one or more of the requisite languages will have an advantage over the applicant with none. It is not necessary to identify a precise area of specialization at the time of application, and we certainly do not expect incoming students to have defined their dissertation research topic at that point, but it will be helpful for us to have an idea of the questions and interests that you foresee as being fundamental to your graduate work. Your statement of purpose should also describe your background in Celtic studies, the source of your interest in the field, and your sense of how our department is a suitable environment for pursuing your intellectual and professional goals.GRE General

    The Department of the Classics has been at the forefront of graduate education in Classics for well over a century. It offers a variety of approaches, emphasizing a wide range of knowledge and skills rather than a narrow early specialization. Traditionally, the PhD in classical philology has been the degree taken by most doctoral candidates, but the department also offers degrees in ancient history, classical archaeology, classical philosophy, Medieval Latin, Byzantine Greek, and Modern Greek. All candidates admitted to the PhD programs are expected to enter with competence in the pertinent languages, ancient and modern, on which they will build in the course of their graduate study.Though the department views the training of future university teachers as a major part of its mandate, its primary concern is to foster as thorough an expertise as possible in those classical, medieval, and modern fields which are centered on Greek and Latin language and literature. For this reason, the department emphasizes the acquisition not only of knowledge, but also of skills—in teaching, in analysis, in research—which will enable its graduates to find careers both within and outside the traditional fields. Great emphasis is laid in the process of graduate admission on the adaptability of students to a flexible job market, and the department assists the career development of its students with placement advice and other practical assistance with the application process.In working towards a degree in classical philology, students may come to emphasize one language over the other and may explore interests in philology, archaeology, history and prehistory, linguistics, philosophy, religion, law, literary criticism, mythography, or the medieval world both western and eastern. The department also offers specialized training in such disciplines as papyrology, epigraphy, palaeography, and numismatics. The resources of other Harvard departments are open to those interested in other ancient languages and scripts, the history of science, and the relations of the Greeks and the Romans with other ancient cultures.Ideally, the doctoral program is conceived as lasting six years.When applying online, prospective students must include a recent sample of written work, such as a term paper, senior thesis, or master’s essay, ideally 15 pages in length.Visit the Department of the Classics for more information and the GSAS Student Handbook for program requirements.Prospective students must have competence in both Greek and Latin sufficient to allow them to take upper-level courses on entering graduate school.The field of classical archaeology is understood to cover Aegean, Greek, Etruscan, and Roman art and archaeology. Students may also work on a cross-departmental basis in related fields such as Egyptian, Near Eastern, Anatolian, Punic, Byzantine, and other areas of European art and archaeology.Entering students are expected to have competence in both Greek and Latin sufficient to take upper-level courses in one of these languages (the “major language”), and above the beginning level of the other (the “minor language”). In exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the director of graduate studies, substitution of another ancient language in the place of the minor language may be arranged. Some preparation in German and either French or Italian should be undertaken before admission to the program.The purpose of the program in classical philosophy is to provide the student with the basic training in both philosophy and classical philology necessary for work in this field. Students who wish their primary grounding to be in the classics should apply to the program in classical philosophy; those who wish their primary grounding to be in philosophy should apply to the parallel program in the Department of Philosophy.Entering students are expected to have competence in Greek and Latin sufficient to take upper-level courses in Greek and above the beginning level in Latin on entering graduate school.A bachelor’s degree in classics (or one in history combined with substantial study of Greek and Latin) represents the best preparation for the study of ancient history, which is here understood to mean Greek history from the Mycenaean period to Roman times, and Roman history from the beginnings to late antiquity. Students applying to study ancient history in the Department of the Classics must have competence in both Greek and Latin sufficient to take upper-level departmental courses in one of these languages (the “major language”), and above the beginning level in the other (the “minor language”). Those wishing to study ancient history at Harvard with less emphasis on languages and texts, and more on other fields of history such as medieval or Byzantine, should note that the Department of History also offers ancient history as a field in its PhD program.Some preparation in German and either French or Italian is also advised before admission to the program. In addition, entering students should also have taken the equivalent of two one-term introductory surveys in Greek history and in Roman history.Prospective students must have competence in both Greek and Latin sufficient to allow them to take upper-level courses on entering graduate school.Prospective students must have competence in both Greek and Latin sufficient to allow them to take upper-level courses on entering graduate school.Harvard libraries house some 80,000 volumes in modern Greek language, literature, history, and folklore. The collection dates back to the early 19th century and is the largest and richest in the world outside of Greece. Its uniqueness owes much to Harvard scholars, above all to the efforts of C. C. Felton, E. A. Sophokles, C. Whitman, and A. B. Lord. Areas of outstanding excellence include rare 19th-century periodicals; first editions of major and minor poets and prose-writers of the 19th and 20th centuries; rare printed editions and manuscripts of liturgical and vernacular texts of the 16th to 18th centuries from Venice, Constantinople, Jassy, Bucharest, Jerusalem (many directly related to the rise of the vernacular and to Cretan Renaissance literature); a virtually complete set of first editions of folksong and folklore publications (including periodicals) in Greek, French, Italian, German, and English; the invaluable Whitman/Rinvolucri collection of karagiozes (shadow puppets); and above all the unique and distinctive Parry/Lord and Notopoulos archives of folk music and folk poetry. In addition, Boston libraries (including Boston University) contain largely unresearched materials on the early 19th century Protestant missions to Greece, while the Hellenic College, Brookline, houses an excellent selection of books related to church history.GRE General

    Harvard’s Department of Comparative Literature is one of the most dynamic and diverse in the country. With a faculty that has included such scholars as Irving Babbitt, Albert Lord, Harry Levin, Claudio Guillén, and Barbara Johnson, the department has played a crucial role in shaping what remains a polymorphous discipline. Our 28 faculty members and more than 50 graduate students have come from across the globe to study, teach, and publish on literatures in several dozen languages from a wide range of historical periods. The research generated here reflects an exhilarating scope of methods, approaches, and questions. Critical theory, literary interpretation, and comparative philology provide the basis for work on translation, the history of ideas, gender, drama, oral poetics, multilingualism, postcolonialism, the environmental and medical humanities, globalization, and world literature. Our students and faculty also work in a variety of fields contiguous with literature, including architecture and the visual arts, film and music, history, anthropology, philosophy, and medicine.In our graduate seminars, students analyze in comparative perspective the literatures and other cultural products of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Coursework is designed to meet individual interests and expectations. Our students are encouraged to complement seminars in comparative literature with courses in other literature and area studies departments (with which most of our faculty hold joint appointments), including African and African American Studies, the Classics, East Asian Languages and Civilizations, English, Germanic Languages and Literatures, History, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Romance Languages and Literatures, Slavic Languages and Literatures, and South Asian Studies. Many of our students also engage in interdisciplinary work, taking courses and often earning qualification in secondary fields such as Film and Visual Studies, Medieval Studies, Music, and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality.The stunning range of our students’ dissertation projects is well supported by Harvard’s unparalleled library resources. Our library system, the largest university collection in the world, comprises 70 libraries, with combined holdings of over 16 million items.In the past few years, the faculty has restructured the Comparative Literature program so as to attend better to students’ needs as they prepare for a professional career in the 21st century. New course and language requirements allow students to engage more fully in sophisticated comparative work from their very first year at Harvard. We have also established specific guidelines for advising and faculty feedback from the first year through the completion of the PhD. Our “Professing Literature” professional development course prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of graduate school. And our Renato Poggioli Faculty/Graduate Student Colloquium enables students of all levels to present their works-in-progress to peers and faculty, everything from seminar papers to mock job talks.Given the nature of graduate projects, most of our students spend time abroad, both for language training and research. This work is largely funded by fellowships from the graduate school as well as from Harvard’s many area centers.When in Cambridge, students enjoy the department's home, the historic Dana-Palmer House at 16 Quincy Street. With its comfortable lounge and meeting and seminar rooms as well as administrative and faculty offices, Dana-Palmer House provides the perfect setting for scholarly exchange.The PhD in Comparative Literature generally takes between six and eight years, depending on a student’s prior training; most students enter with an AM, but this degree is not required for admission.Admissions RequirementsThe Admissions Committee carefully examines the overall profile of each applicant, taking all parts of the candidate’s application into consideration. Locating courses that are offered will help identify which faculty are teaching what courses and if your research interests would be met in our program. Students are also encouraged to closely read faculty websites, which describe the range of expertise of each faculty member.Your application must include a writing sample, which should demonstrate your ability to engage in literary criticism and/or theory. It can be a paper written for a course or a section of a senior thesis or essay. It is usually between 10 and 20 pages. Do not send longer papers with instructions to read an excerpt; lengthier samples should be edited so that they are no longer than 20 pages.Applicants also need to include a statement of purpose that gives the admissions committee a clear sense of your individual interests and strengths. Candidates for admission need not indicate at the time of application a precise field of specialization, but it is helpful to tell us about your aspirations and how the Department of Comparative Literature might help in attaining these goals. These statements are usually one to four pages long.The department's FAQ provide additional information and program requirements are detailed in The GSAS Student Handbook.GRE General

    The Graduate Program in English aims to provide PhD candidates with a broad knowledge of the field of English, including critical and cultural theory. Additional important skills include facility with the tools of scholarship—ancient and modern foreign languages, bibliographic procedures, and textual and editorial methods. The program also emphasizes the ability to write well, to do solid and innovative scholarly and critical work in a specialized field or fields, to teach effectively, and to make articulate presentations at conferences, seminars, and symposia.The program takes from four to seven years to complete, with the majority of students finishing in five or six years. The admissions committee carefully examines the overall profile of each applicant, taking all aspects of the application into consideration. The English Department FAQs for graduate admissions provide answers to many initial questions and The GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.The writing samples (one primary and one secondary) are highly significant parts of the application. Candidates should submit two double-spaced, 15-page papers of no more than 5,000 words each, in 12-point type with 1-inch margins. The writing samples must be examples of critical writing (rather than creative writing) on subjects directly related to English. Applicants should not send longer papers with instructions to read an excerpt or excerpts, but should edit the samples themselves so that they submit only fifteen pages for each paper. Candidates who know the field in which they expect to specialize should, when possible, submit a primary writing sample related to that field.While a candidate's overall GPA is important, it is more important to have an average of no lower than A- in literature (and related) courses. In addition, while we encourage applications from candidates in programs other than English, they must have both the requisite critical skills and a foundation in English literature for graduate work in English. Most of our successful candidates have some knowledge of all the major fields of English literary study and advanced knowledge of the field in which they intend to study.It is important to have strong letters of recommendation from professors who are familiar with candidates’ academic work. Applicants who have been out of school for several years should try to reestablish contact with former professors. Additional letters from employers may also be included. Recommenders should comment not only on the applicant’s academic readiness for our PhD program but also on the applicant’s future potential as teachers and scholars.GSAS regrets that applicants cannot use Interfolio or other recommendation dossier services; recommenders must use the GSAS online recommendation system to submit letters of recommendation.High scores in the verbal (at least 166, or 700 in the old scoring system) and subject tests (at least 650 in English Literature) are positive additions to the application, but are by no means the most important aspect of one’s candidacy. The quantitative and analytical scores carry less weight than the verbal and subject scores. Applicants should be sure to find out the schedule of GRE testing in time to have scores sent to Harvard by the end of December. Scores received after the beginning of January may be too late to be considered.  The subject test in English Literature is a paper-based test, only administered three times per year (April, October, and November), so please plan your applications accordingly. The Apply page provides additional information about GRE requirements.The Statement of Purpose is not a personal statement and should not be heavily weighted down with autobiographical anecdotes. It should be no longer than 1,000 words. It should give the admissions committee a clear sense of applicants’ individual interests and strengths. Applicants need not indicate a precise field of specialization, if they do not know, but it is helpful to know something about a candidate’s professional aspirations and sense of their own skills, as well as how the Harvard Department of English might help in attaining their goals. Those who already have a research topic in mind should outline it in detail, giving a sense of how they plan their progress through the program. Those who do not should at least attempt to define the questions and interests they foresee driving their work over the next few years.While there are no specific prerequisites for admission, a strong language background helps to strengthen the application, and students who lack it should be aware that they will need to address these gaps during their first two years of graduate study.

    The study of film at Harvard functions within the multi-disciplinary examination of audio-visual experience. From Hugo Münsterberg’s pathbreaking forays into the psychological reception of moving images and Rudolf Arnheim’s seminal investigations of “visual thinking” to Paul Sachs’s incorporation of film into the academic and curatorial focus of the fine arts at Harvard and Stanley Cavell’s philosophical approaches to the medium, Harvard has sustained a distinguished tradition of engaging cinema and the cultural, visual, spatial, and philosophical questions that it raises. With their emphases on experimentation in the contemporary arts and creative collaboration among practitioners and critics, the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts provide a singular and unparalleled site for advanced research in Film and Visual Studies. The program aims to foster critical understanding of the interactions between the making of and thinking about film and video, between studio art, performance, and visual culture, and between different arts and pursuits whose objects are audio-visual entities. The Carpenter Center also supports a lively research culture, including the Film and Visual Studies Colloquium and a Film and Visual Studies Workshop for advanced doctoral students, as well as lecture series and exhibitions featuring distinguished artists, filmmakers, and scholars.Interdisciplinary in its impetus, the program draws on and consolidates course offerings in departments throughout the Faculty of Arts and Sciences which consider film and the spatial arts in all their various countenances and investigate the place of visual arts within a variety of contexts. Graduate students may also take advantage of the significant resources of the Harvard Film Archive, which houses a vast collection of 16mm and 35mm film prints as well as rare video materials, vintage film posters, photographs, and promotional materials. The Harvard Film Archive furthers the artistic and academic appreciation of moving image media within the Harvard and the New England community, offering a setting where students and faculty can interact with filmmakers and artists. The archive also houses a Film Conservation Center that allows the archive's conservator and staff to accession new films as well as to preserve its significant collections of independent, international, and silent films.Students and faculty in Film and Visual Studies are also eligible to apply to the Film Study Center for fellowships awarded annually in support of original film, video, and photographic projects. Established in 1957, the Film Study Center provides production equipment, post-production facilities, technical support, and funding for nonfiction works that interpret the world through images and sounds. Among the many important films to have been produced at the Film Study Center are John Marshall’s The Hunters (1956), Robert Gardner’s Forest of Bliss (1985), Irene Lusztig’s Reconstruction (2001), Robb Moss’s The Same River Twice (2002), and, most recently, Ross McElwee’s Bright Leaves (2003), Peter Galison and Robb Moss’s Secrecy (2008), Ilisa Barbash and Lucien Castaing-Taylor’s Sweetgrass (2009), J. P. Sniadecki and Véréna Paravel’s Foreign Parts (2011), Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel’s Leviathan (2013), and Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez’s Manakamana (2014).More information on graduate study is available from Film and Visual Studies and the GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.The following is a set of general guidelines for the admissions process. It should be noted that while several areas are emphasized here, the admissions committee will carefully examine the overall profile of each applicant, taking these and other aspects of the candidate’s application into consideration.The writing sample is one of the most important materials in the application. Candidates should submit only one 15–20 page paper, in 12-point type, double-spaced throughout, with normal margins. The writing sample must be an example of critical writing (rather than creative writing) on a subject directly related to film, performance and/or visual studies. You should not send longer papers with instructions to read an excerpt or excerpts; edit the sample so that you submit only up to 20 pages.While the overall GPA is important, it is more important to have an average of no lower than A- in courses related to film and visual studies or related fields. In addition, if you have not majored in film studies or a related field, it is important to have sufficient background to enter the graduate program—a matter perhaps best determined by speaking with your undergraduate advisor.It is important to have three strong letters of recommendation from professors who are familiar with your academic work. If you have been out of school for several years, reestablish contact with former professors. Additional letters from employers may also be included.High scores (170)  in the verbal portion of the test are positive additions to the application but are by no means the most important aspect of your candidacy. (The quantitative and analytical scores carry less weight than the verbal scores.) You should make timely plans to take these examinations in order to ensure arrival of scores by the December early application deadline. Scores received after January may arrive too late to be considered.The statement of purpose should give the admissions committee a clear sense of your individual interests and strengths. You don’t need to indicate at the time of application precisely what your field of specialization will be, but it is helpful to know something about your aspirations, and how Film and Visual Studies at Harvard might help in attaining these goals.Strong language background helps to strengthen the application, and students who lack it should be aware that they will need to repair these gaps during their first two years of graduate study.GRE General

    A major strength of the graduate program in Germanic Languages and Literatures is its flexibility. While the main focus is on German literature and cultural studies, students often include comparative literature, art, philosophy, film studies, history, and history of science in their coursework and dissertation. Under the guidance of the director of graduate studies, students develop a plan of study that aims, on the one hand, for broad general knowledge of the field as a whole and, on the other, for special emphases of their own. Often, dissertation topics emerge from seminar papers; in addition, preparation for the PhD general exam is specifically geared toward developing expertise in a period and a genre.We also offer older Germanic languages, notably Old Norse, as well as courses on specific aspects of the medieval period. A doctoral program in the older languages is available, which draws on resources in related disciplines such as English and medieval history.  Teaching is required for the PhD degree, not only because sound training and practice are essential for a career in higher education, but also because it provides transferable skills in many other careers for which a PhD may be helpful. Graduate students normally begin teaching in their third year of study. New teachers take a course in foreign language pedagogy, and all graduate students involved in language teaching profit from the guidance of the language program coordinator. Opportunities are provided to teach elementary and intermediate language classes, where the graduate student is responsible for the entire weekly instruction of a class. Many of our graduate students assist in high-enrollment courses on literature, film, thought, and culture given by members of the department or professors in related departments; in such courses, the graduate student leads a weekly discussion group under the direction of the course head. Graduate students may also participate as teaching fellows in the undergraduate Program in General Education, again as leaders of small-group discussion sections that accompany lectures given by a professor. Our students have benefited not only from the teaching opportunities these courses offer, but also from General Education seminars, a special category of course in which they participate in developing the syllabus and materials for a General Education course and receive training in skills needed for teaching undergraduates who are not necessarily specializing in the field.The department conducts regular professional development workshops designed to help graduate students prepare to apply for positions, polish their interviewing skills, practice giving a talk in connection with a job application, and create other materials useful in the job search.We also have a regular workshop for dissertation writers and a colloquium where graduate students at all levels share their work. Every two years, our graduate students design and organize a conference on a topic of their choice; beyond developing organizational skills, this conference allows our students to engage with graduate students at other universities and to get to know more closely the distinguished scholar who gives the keynote speech. Our program has special connections with the Humboldt University in Berlin: every year, several students from the Humboldt come to do research here and participate in our dissertation-writers’ workshop; students from our own cohort may also choose to spend time studying at the Humboldt in Berlin. The rich resources that Harvard offers scholars in Germanic studies include Widener Library’s holdings, which many consider the best German studies research collection in North America; Houghton Library, with its collection of medieval manuscripts and the papers of such major German poets as Hofmannsthal, Rilke, Brecht, and Heine, as well as annotated typescripts of W. G. Sebald’s prose works; the map room in Pusey Library is a revelation; and the Harvard Film Archive, whose collection of 35- and 16-millimeter German films, videos, press booklets, and photographs is unique.All prospective students are required to submit with their online application a copy of a term paper or essay written dealing with a topic in German literature or a closely related field.More information is available from the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures and the GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.GRE General

    The PhD program in history trains students to become both skilled scholars and conscientious teachers. Throughout the program, students work with advisors and other faculty members as they engage in coursework, prepare for and take the general exam, work as teaching fellows, and research and write the dissertation. It generally takes students six or seven years to finish their doctoral degree. Most graduates have pursued academic careers at universities and colleges in the United States and abroad, while others have gone on to successful careers in law and in government.The department has over 50 faculty members with a wide range of research specialties, spanning chronologically from ancient to 20th-century history, geographically from Asia to the United States, and thematically from intellectual history to global and transnational history. Their world-class scholarship garners awards, fellowships, and acclaim, strengthening the recognition of our department as a powerhouse of historical scholarship. Many of our faculty members share appointments with other departments and schools on campus and are involved in interdisciplinary collaborations with committees, programs, and institutions both at Harvard and around the world.As a large research university, Harvard offers many resources and opportunities for its students in the form of lectures, conferences, research centers, fellowships, and grants. Students have access to the more than 80 libraries and 17 million volumes that comprise the Harvard Library, the largest university library in the world.Additionally, students may take courses offered by other departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, or at other Harvard schools, such as Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Harvard Kennedy School.In coordination with Harvard Law School, students may pursue both a PhD in history and a JD at Harvard Law School. To learn more about this course of study consult the Coordinated JD/PhD program overview.Admissions RequirementsEach year, the department ordinarily receives between 300 and 400 applications to the doctoral program and offers admission to about 6 percent of applicants. The typical incoming class size is 16 students. The admissions process is extremely competitive, but if you are serious about pursuing a PhD in history, you are encouraged to apply.Successful applications have shared many of the following characteristics:GRE General Test Prospective candidates must submit scores for the GRE General Test by the application deadline.

    The Department of the History of Science offers a comprehensive graduate program leading to the AM and PhD degrees. We are one of the world’s leading institutions for producing the next generation of professional historians of science, training students to examine the development of science through a course of study that lays a broad foundation for teaching and research across the field. Our faculty and students employ historical, textual, ethnographic, and social scientific methods to explore the genesis and evolution of the sciences and to analyze the growth of science as part of the intellectual and social experience of humankind, as well as to ask larger questions about how the various sciences work in practice and the basis of their authority, how ethical and political decisions are made about their regulation and applications, how they relate to larger intellectual, cultural, social, and political trends and changes, and much more. Faculty and student interests span medieval to contemporary times, and engage the full range of sciences: physics, astronomy, molecular biology, evolutionary theory, technology, brain and behavioral science, the psychological sciences, medicine, and public health. Together we form a lively interdisciplinary community of scholars.Graduate students select courses in history of science and history as well as in fields such as philosophy, government, literature, sociology, anthropology, law, and public policy. Courses in the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology may be taken by cross-registration, as may courses in Science, Technology, and Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. PhD students may also choose to pursue a secondary field such as critical media practice; studies of women, gender, and sexuality; film and visual studies; or science, technology, and society.Our students are encouraged to engage with the department’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, which is one of the largest and richest university collections in the world. These objects represent a broad range of periods and scientific disciplines, including astronomy, navigation, horology, surveying, geology, calculating, physics, biology, medicine, psychology, electricity, and communication. Many departmental courses have a component that uses the collections and students may participate in the curating of special exhibitions; several of our recent PhD graduates have gone on to careers in museum work.Our programs are exciting and intellectually demanding, and our graduate student community is stimulating and diverse. We welcome international students, and in recent years have admitted applicants from many countries, including Taiwan, China, Great Britain, India, Romania, Israel, Germany, Mexico, and Canada. Master of Arts (AM)The department offers admission to a very few select students seeking the free-standing AM degree. External applicants for the degree may be considered on a case-by-case basis; it is expected they will be in fulltime residence. Students who have been accepted to pursue an AM include those pursuing a PhD in another Harvard department, advanced degree candidates at foreign universities, and students with a PhD in another field, from Harvard or elsewhere.Admissions RequirementsTo pursue advanced work in the field, it is desirable to have some preliminary training in the natural or social sciences and in history. No application to the Department of the History of Science will be considered complete unless accompanied by a sample of the student’s recent written work (e.g., term paper, senior thesis, master’s essay). Writing samples should be uploaded when completing the online application.While our faculty invite prospective students to contact them with questions about graduate study in the department, it is not necessary to visit the department to apply for admission to the graduate program. We are not set up to accommodate formal visits from prospective students, but can, on a limited basis, accommodate requests from applicants for brief meetings with faculty with whom they are interested in working. If you will be in the Boston area, please contact individual faculty members well in advance.More information is available from the Department of the History of Science, including  videos of faculty and students.

    Inner Asian and Altaic Studies focuses on the history and cultures of the peoples in the steppe, mountain, forest, and oasis areas between China, Russia, western Iran, and Pakistan. This geographic area comprises Central Asia (namely former Soviet Central Asia, Xinjiang, eastern Iran, and Afghanistan), Kazakhstan, the northern regions of Pakistan, Tibet (including Qinghai, eastern Sichuan, Gansu, and northwestern Yunnan), Mongolia, and Manchuria. The Altaic languages include the Turkic group, the Mongolian group, and the Tunguzic group.The Committee on Inner Asian and Altaic Studies supervises the work of graduate students whose interest in Inner Asia is not confined to languages or history alone, but encompasses linguistics, history, religion, art history, and general cultural study. Courses relating to Inner Asian studies are given by members of the committee and other faculty in the departments of anthropology, East Asian languages and civilizations, history, history of art and architecture, linguistics, music, Near Eastern languages and civilizations, South Asian studies (formerly the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies), and by the Committee on the Study of Religion.  Harvard is preeminent among the very few universities where Inner Asian and Altaic studies may be pursued. Harvard’s library holdings in East European, East Asian, Islamic, and South Asian areas led to a development of strength in the Inner Asian and Altaic fields prior to the actual establishment of this program. The research centers and degree programs that exist at Harvard on the four sides of the Inner Asian area have contributed much material directly relevant to the study of this region. Among its vast holdings, Harvard possesses outstanding collections in many languages including those of Arabic, Chinese, Indian, Iranian, Russian, Tibetan, and Turkish, which comprise the most important primary sources for the study of this area. These collections can be found in the Widener, Harvard-Yenching, Houghton, Dumbarton Oaks, Gibb, Tozzer, Fung, and Fine Arts libraries. All students in the program are expected to meet the requirements of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, including a bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution, a superior undergraduate record, and reading knowledge of at least one appropriate foreign source language such as, for example, Arabic, Chinese, Manchu, Persian, Russian, or Turkish. A master’s degree in hand is advantageous.  Candidates must submit a recent writing sample, preferably on a topic relevant to their application. More information is available from the Committee on Inner Asian and Altaic Studies and program requirements for the degree are detailed in the GSAS Student Handbook.GRE General

    The Department of Linguistics is home to one of the oldest and most distinguished linguistics programs in the United States. Harvard began offering higher degrees in “comparative philology,” as historical linguistics was then called, as early as the 1930s. By 1941, Harvard had a full-fledged Department of Comparative Philology, which became the Department of Linguistics a decade later.The department experienced rapid growth in the 1960s, with the advent of transformational-generative grammar. We became the first linguistics department in the Ivy League to organize its program along generative lines, while also maintaining our traditional strength in historical linguistics.Now, as then, the department fosters a culture of unity in diversity. Our students and faculty come from many different backgrounds and represent a wide range of interests, from purely theoretical to typological, historical, and experimental. What we share is a commitment to empirically grounded research and a respect for the rich traditions of the field.The study of linguistics at Harvard draws much of its strength from the unique range and depth of the University's offerings in related fields, especially ancient and modern languages and the growing Mind/Brain/Behavior Initiative. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the full spectrum of Harvard's resources in planning their schedules; they are also free to cross-register for linguistics and linguistics-related courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While all PhD candidates are expected to acquire a solid background in contemporary linguistic theory, the department places great emphasis on the inseparability of good theoretical work and detailed empirical research, and on the interrelatedness of diachronic and synchronic approaches to the study of linguistic phenomena.Since the department is relatively small, discussion among faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates is ongoing and informal. Special workshops funded by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, together with frequent departmentally sponsored lectures and seminars, bring an unusually large number of outside speakers to Harvard every year. Widener Library contains a matchless linguistic and philological collection, supplemented by a special non-circulating collection accessible only to linguistics students and faculty.Requirements for admission are flexible. Preference is normally given to candidates with a previous background in linguistics, but students with a mature interest in the field and a strong language background are encouraged to apply as well. GRE scores are required of all applicants, and are valid if taken within the last five years.More information is available from the Department of Linguistics and The GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.GRE GeneralHistorical Linguistics

    Harvard’s graduate programs in Middle Eastern studies are coordinated by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES). Established in 1954 to support research and teaching on the Middle East, CMES has produced generations of scholars with a profound understanding of and active engagement in the region. At the core of the Center’s mandate is the pursuit of firsthand knowledge about the Middle East based on literacy in its languages and a deep understanding of its diverse politics, cultures, and histories.Taking a broad interdisciplinary approach encompassing the humanities and social sciences as well as the arts and natural sciences, CMES engages with faculty from across Harvard University whose teaching and research focus on the Middle East, and with other regional studies centers and Harvard libraries and museums holding exceptional and unparalleled collections related to Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. This dynamic academic community includes over 40 faculty, a diverse cohort of more than 50 graduate students, and an annual contingent of 12 to 15 visiting researchers.CMES offers a master’s degree in Regional Studies—Middle East and three joint doctoral degrees with the departments of anthropology, history, and the history of art and architecture.The master’s degree in Middle Eastern studies (AM) is a rigorous two-year academic program designed for entrepreneurial students who wish to develop new academic interests or pursue professional skills. Students have diverse profiles and come from the United States and around the world. They share a capacity for rigorous, scholarly exploration of the Middle East region in all its richness and complexity.Graduates of the program pursue careers in diplomacy, business, media, human rights, and non-governmental work. Some continue for further graduate study in law school, medical school, or PhD programs.Master’s students make valuable contributions to the intellectual community at CMES, their academic home while in the program, and are encouraged to participate in a range of CMES activities, programs, and workshops.Students of the joint PhD programs complete both the requirements of the related department and the language and area studies requirements established by CMES. In addition to coursework and comprehensive exams, PhD students develop a high proficiency in at least one Middle Eastern language and complete a dissertation based on original research.The joint program in anthropology and Middle Eastern Studies is designed for students interested in enriching their program of study for the PhD in anthropology with firsthand knowledge about the Middle East based on literacy in its languages and an understanding of its cultural traditions. Students are full members of the Department of Anthropology cohort, but also have an intellectual home at CMES and access to CMES faculty, facilities, and resources.The joint program in History and Middle Eastern Studies is designed for students interested in enriching their program of study for the PhD in History with firsthand knowledge about the Middle East based on literacy in its languages and an understanding of its history. Students are full members of the Department of History cohort, but also have an intellectual home at CMES and access to CMES faculty, facilities, and resources.The joint program in History of Art and Architecture and Middle Eastern Studies is designed for students interested in enriching their program of study for the PhD in History of Art and Architecture with firsthand knowledge about the Middle East based on literacy in its artistic traditions. Students are full members of the Department of History of Art and Architecture cohort, but also have an intellectual home at CMES and access to CMES faculty, facilities, and resources.CMES welcomes applications from students with a demonstrated interest in Middle Eastern studies. Strong recommendations and a compelling statement of purpose are vital to a successful application. The GRE is required of all applicants; however there is no minimum score or minimum GPA. The admissions committee takes into consideration all elements of an applicant’s background in their evaluation of applications. Prior language training in a Middle Eastern language is not a prerequisite, although it is advantageous to one’s application.Prospective students should read the program descriptions (AM and PhD) carefully before submitting their applications. Students should also consult the CMES Prospective Student FAQs for answers to common questions about applying to CMES. The GSAS Student Handbook provides more information about program requirements.GRE GeneralAnthropology and MES (PhD only)

    The graduate program of the Department of Music offers advanced training in  historical musicology, ethnomusicology, theory, and composition, leading to the degree of PhD in Music. There is no admission to an AM program separate from these PhD programs. In unusual cases, students who cannot successfully complete the general examination may be given the option of completing the requirements for a terminal AM degree.At any given time, 55 to 70 graduate students are in residence, and between 6 and 12 new graduate students enter each year. The Music Building contains a concert hall (the John Knowles Paine Concert Hall), classrooms, faculty and graduate offices, a superb research library (the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library), a microfilm library of primary source materials (the Isham Memorial Library), an archive of world music recordings, listening facilities, a high-quality electronic music studio (HUSEAC: Harvard University Studio for Electroacoustic Composition), an ethnomusicology lab, a collection of early instruments, chamber music rehearsal rooms, and individual piano practice rooms. Other facilities throughout Harvard University include the vast resources of Widener Library, the Houghton Library (which contains rare music prints and manuscripts, and autographs of major composers), Lamont Media, and the library and practice rooms of Dudley House (the center of graduate student activities). In addition, a wealth of musical opportunities is readily available to Harvard students at many neighboring universities (e.g., Boston University, Berklee College of Music, Brandeis University, M.I.T, and the New England Conservatory) and civic and professional institutions (e.g., Boston Symphony Orchestra, Boston Public Library, and Museum of Fine Arts with the Mason Collection of Musical Instruments).Graduate students are awarded six years guaranteed funding (including living expenses) when accepted to a PhD program.At Harvard, musicology is broadly defined as the disciplined study of music and includes the historical, comparative, and systematic aspects of the field. The program incorporates two tracks: historical musicology, with an emphasis on the history, theory, and literature of Western music in its contexts from antiquity to the present; and ethnomusicology, which concentrates on the ethnographic study of any musical tradition in relationship to its cultural setting. Most graduate courses in historical musicology and ethnomusicology are research seminars; many treat specific topics, periods, and regions, while others deal with current problems and methods. On the completion of preparatory training and the passing of the general examinations, PhD dissertations may be written in either field.The PhD in music theory is characterized both by a deep involvement in the inner workings of music and by an engagement with the wider philosophical, cultural, and psychological questions surrounding music. The program reflects this interdisciplinary interest of our students and seeks to explore the links of music theory to other areas of critical engagement, while providing our theorists with the specialized skills they require. The teaching in the program emphasizes analytical techniques—all students take courses on Schenkerian theory and on a range of tonal and post-tonal analytical practices, as well as an introductory course to explore current issues in the field. At the same time, the program also encourages students to build a framework in which to place these techniques and to reflect on the underpinnings of music theory. Regular courses on questions in psychology, temporality, history of music theory, and aesthetics are also available and often take music theory into interdisciplinary territory. Graduate courses on challenging repertoires—e.g. modal theory, non-Western music, or very recent composition—frequently round off our offerings.The dissertation projects our theory graduates work on reflect this unique combination of interests. Recent and current PhD topics include feminist approaches to performance analysis, microtonality and tone imaginations, multi-modal analysis of boy-band videos, Athanasius Kircher's Musurgia Universalis (1650), and neuro-scientific imaging of perceptual parameters.Our theory faculty is enhanced on a regular basis by exciting visiting faculty, who complement our existing research and teaching strengths in interesting new ways. Recent visitors have included Allan Keiler (Brandeis), Fred Lerdahl (Columbia), Allen Forte (Yale), Ellie Hisama (Columbia), and Martin Scherzinger (NYU), as well as Brian Ferneyhough (Stanford), Helmut Lachenmann (Stuttgart), and Harrison Birtwistle (London). Harvard's program in composition is designed to give students the time and opportunity to develop as composers by offering general musical guidance as well as specific individual criticism of their works. The program is centered around the students' achieving clarity of expression through developing their command of compositional technique. In addition, acquaintance with the literature of the past and present through analysis and performance is considered indispensable. Most courses are seminars and deal with specific topics or student works.The student typically spends the first two years in the department on coursework. The third, fourth, and fifth years are devoted to work on the dissertation and teaching, as well as active participation in composition colloquia and Harvard Group for New Music concerts. Composers may spend one term during their 4th year at another art institution or university if a particular research project or artistic residency can be obtained.On the completion of preparatory training and the passing of the general examinations (during the summer before the third year), PhD dissertations comprising a substantial portfolio of between five and seven pieces of varied scoring and length may be submitted. * Applications are not being accepted for fall 2018 The AM in music with a specialty in performance practice is designed to provide intellectual and scholarly background to finished musicians who are preparing or engaged in careers as performers and teachers. The emphasis is on preparing students to work with sources, editions, theoretical writings, organology, and other matters of importance to performance styles as related to repertories. Additional areas such as differences in the meaning of terminology and notation from composer to composer or from era to era, ornamentatio, liberties of tempo and declamation, and improvisation will be addressed. It is a two-year program in which students take a selection of departmental courses focused on this specialty and write an AM thesis.Many innovative research areas are not classifiable along traditional lines but rather borrow from a variety of approaches and methods. This includes projects that integrate creative components or performance into academic work. Candidates interested in the cross-disciplinary category should clearly lay out their academic interests and musical experience. They should present a clear rationale for the cross-disciplinary nature of their interests. Where appropriate, candidates are encouraged to include performance materials in their application. Candidates admitted through the cross-disciplinary category will declare one of the departmental programs and will take generals and pursue dissertation work in that program, with modifications as appropriate.Admissions decisions are made by Department of Music faculty, who weigh a combination of factors such as GRE scores, past academic record, strength of scholarly (or compositional) work, and recommendations. The TOEFL test may be required if English is not your first language (recommended minimum score is 80). All applicants are required to take the GRE general test.More information is available the Department of Music and The GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.Applicants to the all programs except the composition PhD must submit, along with their applications, samples of their previous scholarly work in musicology (for the musicology PhD), ethnomusicology (for ethnomusicology PhD), or theory (for the theory PhD). The online application will allow you to upload up to 20 pages of material.Applicants to the composition PhD must submit three to four compositions. Scores are required in printed format and should be mailed to the GSAS Office of Admissions (scores will not be returned unless a self-addressed, stamped envelope is included). Recordings are highly recommended; links to SoundCloud or other online resource should be noted in the Additional Academic Background section of the application.* Applications are not being accepted for fall 2018Ordinarily, the department expects to enroll one to two AM students a year or every two years. No auditions are required. 
Financial Aid for this program is very limited. Students may apply for Paine Traveling Fellowships and/or the Department Travel Fund to support some of their research. All fellowship funding is at the discretion of the Scholarship Committee. Other University funding may be available.
NOTE: Students wishing to continue at Harvard for the PhD will apply in the normal manner and their applications will be considered in the customary way. Students admitted to the PhD program will be granted credit for work done at Harvard or elsewhere according to departmental guidelines.You are welcome to visit the Department of Music at any time, although we in no way require or expect you to make the trip. You should know that we do invite the students we admit to our program to come to Cambridge as part of our admissions process. At that time, admitted students meet with faculty, get to know our current students, and are introduced to other students who have also been admitted.We regret that we are not able to make appointments with individual faculty members during a pre-admissions visit.If you do decide to make a visit prior to the admissions deadline, there are optimal times to visit, such as between October and our December holiday break. If you visit at another time of the year, check the academic schedule to avoid reading/exam periods and semester breaks. It is not necessary to visit, nor should you see it as a way to improve your chances of admission.Rather, a visit is simply a good way to learn about our department's intellectual environment and infrastructure. We urge you to consult the course schedule so that you can plan to sit in on one or more graduate seminars (please e-mail the department to ask permission of the instructing professor first). This is the best way to get to know the professors and students. You may also want to attend any colloquia, lectures, or faculty seminars that coincide with your visit or make an appointment to tour the music library and other Harvard libraries. It may also be possible to chat informally with some of our current graduate students, who are apt to be working in the department and library during the academic year.Contact Kaye Denny or Charles Stillman or call 617-495-2791 for more information about the schedule of events.GRE GeneralComposition (PhD only)

    The Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (NELC) encompasses the study of ancient and modern peoples, languages, literatures, cultures, and societies of the Near and Middle East. Languages include Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic, Armenian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Iranian, Persian, Sumerian, Turkish, and Yiddish.The NELC faculty is world-renowned and Harvard’s educational resources in the various fields of Near Eastern studies are virtually unparalleled. Widener Library, for example, has a broad assortment of holdings in Arabic, Armenian, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, and Yiddish literature. For students interested in biblical or other ancient Near Eastern studies, or in the archaeology of the Near East, a variety of opportunities for archaeological work in the Middle East are available. Students interested in the modern Near Eastern political or social studies should familiarize themselves with the resources and personnel of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES). CMES is the coordinating body and a primary source of intellectual and material support within Harvard for scholarly pursuits covering the vast area between Morocco and Iran, and beyond. It was the first center of its kind and is responsible for teaching as well as research. The Center for Jewish Studies (CJS) is the focal point at Harvard for the study and teaching of Judaica through publications, fellowships, lectures, and symposia on topics of interest to scholars and postdoctoral research fellows. The Harvard Semitic Museum, in which NELC is housed, has a superb collection of ancient and medieval artifacts representing many of the cultures of the Middle and Near East. As a university teaching museum, the Semitic Museum is committed to providing access to these materials for study and teaching.Ancient Near Eastern studies’ sub-fields include Akkadian and Sumerian studies, archaeology of the Levant, Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, Iranian studies, and Egyptology.The program in Jewish History and Culture focuses on the history and literature of the Jewish people from late antiquity to modern times, and is divided chronologically into five periods: the Hebrew Bible in its Jewish interpretive context; ancient Jewish history and culture; medieval Jewish history and culture; modern Jewish history and culture; and modern Jewish literatures. While students generally choose to focus their interests by period, the program itself stresses "vertical" competence: all students are expected to gain some expertise in chronological periods other than their main one. As an alternative to specialization by chronological period, students may choose to focus their studies along thematic lines, for example on the history of Jewish biblical exegesis. Ability to work with classical Hebrew sources in the original is a prerequisite for admission to the program.The Histories and Cultures of Muslim Societies program focuses on the histories, literatures, philosophy, religious thought, and legal institutions of Muslim societies. Its primary strength lies in the coverage of a broad range of fields of study in pre-modern and modern periods, particularly with regard to Islamic civilizations in the Near and Middle East. As a result of a growing recognition that the study of Islam and Muslim societies must embrace wider, more inclusive study of the diverse ethnic, racial, and religious groups that have been constituents of Muslim cultures in different parts of the world, the program also provides students the opportunity to engage in the comparative study of Muslim societies, particularly in South Asia and Africa and their complex connections with the Near East.The program in Histories and Cultures of Muslim Societies currently includes the following subfields:In addition to the application materials requested by GSAS, no application to the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations will be considered complete unless accompanied by a recent sample of the student's written work (e.g., term paper, senior thesis, master’s essay). There is not a specified length for this writing sample. However, one should keep in mind that the admissions committee may not have the time to examine carefully a large writing sample in its entirety. Please upload your writing sample to your online application along with your statement of purpose and unofficial transcript.For the master of arts (AM) program: Before seeking admission, applicants will normally have attained a basic knowledge of a Near Eastern language central to their field of concentration. In addition, advanced reading knowledge of either French or German is required before admission; the student will be tested prior to the first week of classes in the first term.For the doctor of philosophy (PhD) program: Before seeking admission, applicants will normally have attained an ability to read and comprehend sources in the Near Eastern language central to their field of concentration. In addition, advanced reading knowledge of French or German is required before admission to the doctoral program; the student will be tested prior to the first week of classes in the first term.More information is available from the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and The GSAS handbook details program requirements.GRE General

    The graduate program in philosophy at Harvard offers students the opportunity to work and to develop their ideas in a stimulating and supportive community of fellow doctoral students, faculty members, and visiting scholars. Among the special strengths of the department are moral and political philosophy, aesthetics, epistemology, philosophy of logic, philosophy of language, the history of analytic philosophy, ancient philosophy, Kant, and Wittgenstein.The typical entering class ranges from five to eight students. This small size helps foster a sense of community among doctoral students and ensures that they have substantial access to and interaction with their faculty colleagues.In addition to the standard PhD in philosophy, the department offers a PhD in classical philosophy in collaboration with the Department of the Classics and a coordinated JD/PhD program in conjunction with Harvard Law School.The department’s graduate program is essentially a PhD program. Because the principal employment for men and women with advanced training in philosophy is in college teaching requiring the PhD, the department ordinarily does not admit applicants who wish to study only for the master’s (AM) degree. The AM may be taken as a step toward the PhD after a minimum of two terms in residence. A candidate for the AM must satisfy the preliminary, distribution, and logic requirements for the PhD; however, the preliminary requirement is reduced to ten half-courses, and only seven of the eight distribution units are required for the AM. In addition, the second-year paper requirement must be satisfied. There is no language requirement for the AM.The department requires that applicants have obtained a solid undergraduate background in philosophy, indicating that they have a good grounding in the history of philosophy, as well as familiarity with contemporary work in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics, and logic.The Admissions Committee looks for evidence of outstanding potential in the field of philosophy as shown in the applicant’s academic record, letters of recommendation, and statement of purpose in the application.A writing sample must be submitted with the online application.Scope: The sample must address a substantial philosophical problem, whether it is an evaluation or presentation of an argument, or a serious attempt to interpret a difficult text.Length: In general, the writing sample should be at least 12 to 15 pages long, but no more than 40 pages; a rough maximum length would be about 25 pages. The admissions committee generally does not have time to read papers longer than this.Format: The writing sample should be submitted in electronic format, formatted for 8.5-inch x 11-inch paper, 1-inch margins, with double-spaced text in a common 12 point font, such as Times New Roman.The Department of Philosophy receives nearly 300 applications each year. We ordinarily expect an entering class of five to eight doctoral students. Although the number of qualified applicants exceeds the number of offers the department can make, we invite all who would like to study philosophy at Harvard to apply.Note: Students seeking admission to the coordinated JD/PhD program must apply to and be separately admitted to Harvard Law School and the Department of Philosophy.More information is available from the Department of Philosophy and The GSAS Student Handbook details current program requirements.GRE General

    Regional Studies–East Asia (RSEA) is a vibrant interdisciplinary area studies program designed to accommodate a wide range of interests and needs for graduate training in the languages, societies, and cultures of East Asia. The program affords students interested in a professional career of engagement with Asia an opportunity to pursue a flexible and varied course of instruction related to their career interests; it also serves the needs of students who wish to enter a PhD program but require further background training in the field of East Asian studies. RSEA prepares students for careers in higher education, politics, the military, journalism, international organizations, and the business and financial sectors.RSEA dates back to 1946, when renowned China scholar John King Fairbank launched a full-time seminar leading to a master’s degree known as Regional Studies–China; the seminar was later expanded to include Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and became the AM program known as Regional Studies–East Asia.For more than half a century, RSEA transformed the field of East Asian Studies and produced over a thousand alumni in all walks of life. Many of RSEA’s alumni have achieved distinction in the academic world or in the world of public service.In evaluating applications, the RSEA admissions committee may consider any and all of the following criteria for admission: proven academic excellence, the extent of appropriate language training and prior experience in East Asia, letters of recommendation, writing ability (as demonstrated by a writing sample no longer than 20 pages), GRE scores and, where applicable, TOFEL scores (a score of at least 100 on the iBT TOEFL is required), together with the student’s own statement of purpose and proposed subject of study. In addition, each study plan is evaluated to assess the availability of suitable faculty resources to provide adequate training and supervision to an applicant, if admitted.Please note that on your application, you are asked to indicate which Harvard faculty member(s) you would like to work with should you be admitted into the program. It is important for you to do so to ensure that faculty members with whom you would like to work are informed when your application becomes available for review. There is no need to contact faculty directly.Regional Studies–East Asia provides more information and an admission FAQ. The GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.GRE General

    Resources for the study of religion at Harvard are vast. We offer courses in the whole range of religious traditions from the ancient Zoroastrian tradition to modern Christian liberation movements, Islamic and Jewish philosophies, Buddhist social movements, and Hindu arts and culture. Some faculty work primarily as historians, others as scholars of texts, others as anthropologists, although the boundaries of these methodologies are never firm. Some are adherents of a religious tradition; others are not at all religious. The study of religion is exciting and challenging precisely because of the conversations that take place across the complexities of disciplines, traditions, and intellectual commitments.The PhD program in the study of religion dates from 1934, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences established a degree of PhD in the history and philosophy of religion. Its purpose, as stated by the faculty, was “to make possible a course of studies which shall enable the candidate both to lay a broad and sufficient foundation for teaching and study within the field of religion, and to do individual research at some point in that field.” In accordance with that expressed intention, the faculty voted in 1963 to name the program the Study of Religion. This program is jointly offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Divinity School and administered by the Committee on the Study of Religion. Faculty from both schools advise PhD students and offer classes in the program. Students enroll in and receive their PhD from GSAS though they may study primarily with faculty from Harvard Divinity School.Admission to the PhD program in the Study of Religion at Harvard is very competitive: typically only 5 to 6 percent of all applicants are admitted. Basic requirements include a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent with an undergraduate record of outstanding quality—a previous master’s degree is not required, but it is the rare, exceptional student who is admitted without one. Similarly, while a previous major in the field of religion is not required, the applicant’s preparation in this and related subjects is a critical consideration.Applicants must submit current GRE scores and TOEFL scores if a non-native English speaker, unless the applicant holds a BA degree (or equivalent degree) from an English-speaking university. For the PhD in religion, the minimum iBT TOEFL score is 105. In addition, applicants must submit an abstract of courses, three letters of recommendation, and a brief writing sample no more than 10 pages or 2,500 words. A statement of purpose outlining their proposed project is also required.When applying, prospective students should review the current fields of research. The Committee on the Study of Religion admits students who have clearly defined intellectual interests evidenced in the statement of purpose and completed application. Applicants may choose only one area of specialization from the list.In cases where a student’s interest span two fields, faculty related to both fields will review the application. Applicants must clearly explain their interdisciplinary interests in their statement of purpose and also state which field would be their primary home. If you find your particular field of interest is not noted, please contact us directly.All doctoral applicants are expected to have foundational language work needed for primary research (textual or ethnographic) in the area of specialization (Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Sanskrit, Arabic, Chinese, etc.) at the time of application. In addition, admitted students must demonstrate reading competence in two modern languages of secondary scholarship relevant to their course of study. These languages are determined in consultation with an advisor after admission to the program, typically German and French.More information is available from the Committee on the Study of Religion and the GSAS Student Handbook details program requirements.GRE General

    Deeply committed to interdisciplinary studies, the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard encourages graduate students to situate literature in the broad context of cultural productions, ranging from the canonical to alternative modes.Combining a broad knowledge of each literature through diverse course offerings  and specialized research working one-on-one with faculty, our graduate programs nurture students’ individual interests. A strong sense of community among students and faculty, particularly within specialties, creates a graduate experience as unique as each chosen dissertation topic. Students pursue research topics in the French and Francophone, Italian, Portuguese and Luso-Brazilian, or Spanish and Latin American literary traditions, alone or in combination, leading to the PhD.Our students further enjoy the benefits of interaction with history and literature, studies of women, gender, and sexuality, comparative literature, visual and environmental studies, African American studies, and other programs and departments at Harvard.Admission to the graduate program is based on merit alone. Every offer of admission is accompanied by an offer of full financial aid, consisting of stipend and/or teaching salary, tuition and health fees, and supplemental fellowships available competitively. We also encourage our students to travel and spend time abroad, through our exchange programs with various institutions in France, Italy, Spain, and Latin America, or through other forms of financial and institutional support.When applying, you must include a writing sample of your best scholarly work in your chosen language of study, not to exceed 15 to 20 double spaced pages, written in the target language..Prospective applicants in Romance Languages and Literatures often ask about criteria for admissions decisions. The committees assess scholarly promise based on each student's dossier as a whole. We expect high GRE scores of our applicants. We consider test scores to serve as likely indices of academic potential, but also place them in the context of the candidate’s overall profile.To all applicants holding previous master’s degrees: At the end of the first year of studies, students may formally request credit for up to four semester-long courses taken elsewhere.Visit Department of Romance Languages and Literatures for more information and the GSAS Student Handbook for program requirements.GRE General

    The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers graduate students the opportunity to study the literatures, cultures, and languages of the Slavic world, including especially Russia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia. The department offers interdisciplinary and comparative courses across the cultures of the Slavic world, encouraging a wide variety of specializations from literature to film, art, and visual culture.Most of our doctoral candidates specialize in literature, working closely with faculty in their major fields to create a program oriented around their particular interests; coursework is possible in allied fields (such as History, Anthropology, Government, Film, and Music) as well. Many of our students also do work in linguistics; aAll students study Old Church Slavonic and take a practical linguistics course as part of their preparation for teaching language courses.Faculty in the department teach a wide range of courses, from medieval to contemporary culture. These courses take many different approaches, drawing on  cultural studies, formalism, gender studies, linguistics, philology, political theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, semiotics, structuralism, and visual studies, among others. The program aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of the field as well as a sense of historical depth. We emphasize the ability to write well, to do innovative scholarly and critical work, and to make effective presentations at conferences and symposia. Teaching effectively is a skill we seek to cultivate in all our students, preparing them for both literature and language courses. The program takes from five to eight years to complete, with most students completing the PhD degree in six or seven years, often including dissertation research abroad.The department maintains close working ties with other departments and centers studying the Slavic world at Harvard, including the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies (which sponsors its own Master’s Degree program in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia) and the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. The Harvard Film Archive houses an extensive and unique collection devoted to Russian and Soviet cinema, which includes 35- and 16-millimeter films.The department requires that doctoral candidates work as teaching fellows in its language and literature courses, regarding such experience as an integral part of doctoral training. Students normally teach in the third and fourth years of study, and often beyond.If you are interested in a terminal master’s degree, please review information on the master’s degree in Regional Studies: Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia (REECA) offered by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.We welcome applicants with traditional and non-traditional preparation in the field, as long as their foreign-language, linguistic, and literary-studies skills are strong. Applicants should show knowledge of Russian (or the language of the student's major field) equivalent to the Harvard class “Advanced Russian II: Reading, Composition, and Conversation.”Formal training in literature or linguistics is highly desirable for admission. In order to anticipate the language requirement, it helps for a candidate to have a reading knowledge of French or German, although this is not a prerequisite.No application for admission will be considered complete unless accompanied by a recent and extensive sample (usually 20-25 pages) of the student’s written work in English.The department ordinarily interviews finalists for admission by Skype in late January and early February. Admitted students are encouraged to come to campus whenever they are able for a one-day visit, usually in February or March, to meet with the faculty and graduate students and to find out more about our programs of study.We also welcome potential candidates who wish to come to Cambridge for informational interviews during the spring or fall before submitting an application. Contact the department administrator to arrange meetings with individual faculty members. In such cases, candidates should also arrange to meet with the current director of graduate studies for Slavic and possibly the department chair.More information is available from the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures and the GSAS Student Handbook for program requirements.GRE General

    The Department of South Asian Studies offers programs of study leading to the doctor of philosophy (PhD) and, in exceptional cases, the master of arts (AM) degrees. While graduate work is tailored to individual intellectual interests, all doctoral students are expected to ground their work in primary language materials and participate in broadly interdisciplinary studies of South Asian languages, histories, and cultures.The department has historic and well-defined courses of graduate study in Sanskrit and Indian studies and Tibetan and Himalayan studies. It is our expectation that candidates for doctoral study will propose other programs in South Asian studies. Such programs may have a regional emphasis, a disciplinary or multi-disciplinary emphasis, or an emphasis on a particular era of South Asian history, including modern South Asia. Some of the most exciting multi-disciplinary work in the global academy today has been pioneered by scholars of South Asian Studies, and this program intends to provide a platform for such study here at Harvard.All of the department’s PhD programs emphasize the study of South Asian languages as foundational for scholarly work. Currently, members of the department focus in their own work on Hindi-Urdu (including Avadhi, Braj, and modern dialects), Middle Indic (Pali, Prakrit), Nepali, Sanskrit (Vedic, Classical), Tamil (Classical, Modern), and Tibetan (Classical, Modern). The department also supports instruction in Bahasa Indonesia, Bengali, Burmese, Gujarati, Sindhi, and Thai. Persian is regularly offered through the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.We emphasize a rigorous approach to South Asian texts and traditions, the cultural, intellectual, and social practices that they inform, and the diverse disciplinary perspectives that are needed to study and write about them. Students are encouraged to view their chosen topics in their historical contexts while also exploring their significance to ongoing South Asian traditions and/or to contemporary issues in the humanities and social sciences.In exceptional cases, the department will admit to a one year AM program particularly promising students who would like to strengthen their background in South Asian studies but who may not have all of the qualifications for doctoral study. Applicants should be aware that there is no funding available for AM candidates.Admission to the PhD program is offered on the basis of an outstanding academic record, letters of recommendation, a writing sample, and, ordinarily, GRE scores. A strong background in one or more areas of South Asian studies is required. For admission to the Sanskrit and Indian studies program, prerequisites include two years of Sanskrit, and for the Tibetan and Himalayan studies program, two years of classical Tibetan. These language requirements correspond to the first and second years of Sanskrit or Tibetan taught at Harvard. For the South Asian studies program, candidates should have at least two years of study in a South Asian language. The student’s command of the relevant languages will be evaluated during the first term.Applicants with the requisite background should e-mail the department well before the admissions deadline. Please describe your previous academic work in South Asian studies and your specific research interests. Include the names of faculty members with whom you might wish to work.Visit the Department of South Asian Studies for more information and the GSAS Student Handbook for program requirements.GRE General

    Each year, we welcome to our diverse academic community a select group of non-degree scholars from around the globe as special students and visiting fellows.Individuals with academic or professional reasons for pursuing graduate-level study without entering a degree program may register as special students and engage in coursework or a combination of coursework and research for academic credit, for one term or one year only. While they are not candidates for any degree, special students are much like first-year graduate students; they participate in coursework and may request an official Harvard transcript of courses and grades received.As a special student, you are admitted to GSAS and have access to most student privileges. You are eligible to enroll in graduate or undergraduate courses, depending on your academic record. You must hold a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent and must present evidence of fitness for admission at the graduate level. Full tuition is charged and you are not eligible for institutional financial aid. Tuition cannot be waived or reduced.Harvard Extension School students working toward an ALB or ALM degree who wish to take courses not offered at Harvard Extension School or Harvard Summer School may enroll as a GSAS special student, taking two courses per term for one academic year.To qualify, candidates must earn a minimum number of Harvard Extension School credits with a specific GPA and obtain recommendations from their program director and two Harvard Extension School instructors. For more information, ALM candidates should review the Special Student Information Sheet [PDF] and ALB candidates should review Special Student Procedures.Scholars intending to conduct independent research who hold a doctorate, have equivalent professional experience, or are advanced doctoral candidates who have completed all required coursework, may register at GSAS as a visiting fellow. Visiting fellows are considered full-time research students, with access to Harvard University’s libraries and facilities, and may apply for membership in the Harvard Faculty Club. While visiting fellows do not take courses for academic credit, they may audit courses with the approval of the instructor and seek faculty guidance as they conduct independent research. Please note that visiting fellows are normally not permitted to audit basic skills courses such as beginning languages or computer science.In order to be considered for visiting fellow status, a scholar should note in their application the name of any faculty members with whom they intend to work and reference any communication with faculty members or academic departments. While visiting fellows are occasionally invited by departments or research centers to participate in seminars or other organized activities, they are expected to conduct their research independently.Visiting fellows are charged Reduced Tuition, which may not be waived, and they are not eligible for institutional financial aid. Please note that visiting fellow status is full time.Before applying for special student or visiting fellow status, scholars should select one department to affiliate with based on their academic interests. While applicants seeking more interdisciplinary opportunities may choose the General Studies Program, GSAS reserves the right to send an application to a specific admissions committee if a candidate’s experience and interests are more suited to a particular department.* Applicants must have the confirmed support of at least one faculty member to be considered.
† Accepts applications for visiting fellow status only.
‡The Department of Government and the committees on Public Policy and on Political Economy and Government do not permit affiliation as a special student if you plan to apply for PhD study within 18 months.
§ Only special student applications are considered; research students should inquire directly with the department.To review the courses offered during a particular term, access the Public Course Catalog. Courses marked with an asterisk require instructor approval before you can register and those in brackets are not offered during the current term, but may be offered in the future. Special students are restricted from participating in a select group of departmental offerings.Special students may audit coursework upon securing approval of the course instructor, who determines the level of participation. A grade is not received for the course, but the student’s transcript will reference “TIME-A.” Full tuition is charged for an officially audited course.Special students may also participate in a supervised independent research project in lieu of a half-course, after securing approval from a faculty member. While a grade is not received for the course, the student’s transcript will reference “TIME-C.” Full tuition is charged.Special students may enroll in a limited number of courses (not more than half of one’s total program per term) in other Harvard faculties or cooperating schools. Learn more by reviewing Harvard’s cross-registration procedures. Enrollment cannot be guaranteed in advance of registration.There are two application cycles each year:March 1 for full academic year (September to May) or fall term only (September to December) Admitted students are notified by June 1October 1 for spring term only (January to May) Admitted students are notified by December 1How to applySubmit Online ApplicationSpecial Students and Visiting Fellows Office

    We've collected a list of frequently asked questions to help you with your transition to GSAS.Can I affiliate with more than one department or program?
Special student applicants must choose one department or program with which to affiliate based on their proposed plan of study. If you demonstrate that your academic interests are truly interdisciplinary, you may choose general studies, however, very few students will be admitted from this category.If I was denied admission to a GSAS degree program, can I apply for special student status?
Individuals denied admission to a degree program at GSAS cannot apply as a special student for the same academic year.Can special students transfer into a degree-seeking program?
While special students participate in coursework or a combination of coursework and research, they may not transfer to a degree-seeking program. They may, however, apply to GSAS at a later date.If I am admitted to GSAS after I study as a special student, will my credits count toward my program?
Special students who later apply and are admitted to a GSAS degree program may petition to apply their academic and financial credit toward their degree requirements.As a special student, can I register in limited-enrollment courses?
Priority is reserved for degree-seeking students. Official enrollment into any course is always subject to the approval of the instructor.Can I focus only on an independent research project?
An independent research project must count for no more than half of the courses you are enrolled in.Can I conduct premedical coursework and receive advising as a special student?
The GSAS Special Students and Visiting Fellows Office does not offer a premedical advising program. Premedical students must access the career counseling and placement services offered at their undergraduate institutions.Can special students take courses during the summer?
GSAS does not offer coursework during the summer. Those interested in taking summer courses may register through Harvard Summer School.Can special students enroll in courses at another Harvard school?
Yes. Special students may, with instructor consent, enroll in courses at other Harvard schools via the cross-registration process. However, students may not take more than 50 percent of their classes outside of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.I’m an undergraduate at another institution. Can I take Harvard classes?
Students currently enrolled in undergraduate programs elsewhere who wish to take undergraduate courses at Harvard should contact the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program.Can I affiliate with more than one department or program?
Visiting fellows should choose one department or program to affiliate with based on their academic interests.Can I take a course for credit as a visiting fellow?
Visiting fellows may audit courses with the permission of the instructor. Those interested in taking courses for credit may apply for Special Student status.If I was denied admission to a GSAS degree program, can I apply for visiting fellow status?
Individuals denied admission to a degree program at GSAS cannot apply as a visiting fellow for the same academic year.Can I audit a class at another Harvard School or local university?
Visiting fellows may audit courses at Harvard Business School, Harvard Divinity School, and Harvard Law School (Harvard Business School charges auditors a cross-registration materials fee) with instructor permission. They may also audit courses at MIT and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University with permission from the course’s instructor.As a visiting fellow, can I apply to a degree-seeking program?
While visiting fellows maintain an affiliation with a department and seek advice from faculty, they conduct their research independently and may not apply to a degree-seeking program.I’m a faculty member at another university. Can I register as a visiting fellow?
Faculty members from other universities whose scholarship distinguishes them in their field may be eligible for an academic appointment as visiting scholar. Contact your academic department of interest to inquire about their policy.I want to be a visiting fellow at another Harvard School. Can I apply through GSAS?
Harvard University offers many opportunities to engage in research. Scholars wishing to concentrate their research at a Harvard graduate school other than GSAS should contact the School’s admissions office directly to determine their policy.How many courses are international special students required to take each term?
Visa requirements specify that international special students must be enrolled full time while registered at GSAS, which equates to 16 credits, or four semester-long courses.Do audited courses or independent research study count toward my visa requirements?
Officially audited classes are counted toward the four-courses required for international students; you may audit no more than half of the courses you are enrolled in.Will Harvard sponsor my visa?
Yes! Individuals who are not US citizens ordinarily conduct their studies on a Harvard-sponsored student (F-1) visa. A Harvard-sponsored Exchange Scholar (J-1) visa will be issued upon request based on formal exchange agreement requirements. Visa arrangements cannot be made until the applicant has been admitted and the necessary financial certification has been provided to the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Office by the student. In order to satisfy US Immigration requirements, international students must demonstrate that they can afford all expenses, including tuition, fees, and living expenses. For additional information about visa regulations please contact the Harvard International Office.How can non-native English speakers demonstrate English proficiency?
Non-native English speakers who attended a university full-time or participated in a year-long program in which English is the language of instruction will have demonstrated English proficiency. If you do not have this experience, you will need to take the Internet-based test (iBT) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), and request that ETS send an official score report to the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Office at the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (using Code 3478). Applicants must receive a minimum score of 80; some programs may require a higher score.Alternatively, you may submit results of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) test (the minimum accepted score is 7), or the Pearson Test of English (PTE) results (the minimum accepted score is 70).If you feel that you meet this prerequisite in another way, please explain why in your application. Please note that if you require a J-1 visa and you have not taken the TOEFL nor have attended an English speaking institution, then you may be required to demonstrate adequate English proficiency by means of an official interview before acceptance into the program.Is there an International Student Orientation at the beginning of each academic year?
Yes! All international students (including special students and visiting fellows) are invited to attend International Student Orientation during August, where they learn about life at GSAS.If admitted, may I take any of the courses listed in the FAS course catalog?
For the most part, yes! If a course has limited enrollment, full-time undergraduates and other students in Harvard degree programs have first priority. Also, special students and visiting fellows are restricted from participating in a select group of departmental offerings.Do I need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)?
The GRE is not a required component of the application.How much is the application fee?
The fee is $105, payable in the online application.What is an official vs. an unofficial transcript?
A transcript becomes unofficial once the student obtains the document. Official transcripts are typically sent directly to GSAS from your previous institutions; however, official transcripts can come directly from the student if sealed by the institution. An electronic version of your transcript sent to us directly from your institution to GSAS is also acceptable as an official transcript.What is the best way to contact the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Office?
The office is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The best time to contact the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Office is between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.Does Harvard provide health insurance?
Yes! Every registered student is automatically charged and enrolled in the Harvard University Student Health Plan (HUSHP), which the University offers through  Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Massachusetts. There is also a required Harvard University Health Services fee paid each term that allows any student to take advantage of Harvard University Health Services walk-in clinic. If students provide documentation establishing that they have comparable insurance that meets pre-determined Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Harvard University Health Services standards, they may be able to waive the HUSHP coverage and associated fee.Do I need immunizations in order to enroll?
Yes! By state law, students enrolling full-time in Massachusetts colleges and universities are required to provide proof of immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hepatitis B, and meningococcal (or submit a waiver for the meningococcal). Proof of immunizations is compulsory prior to registration. Visit Harvard University Health Services for forms and information.Can special students and visiting fellows benefit from Harvard-administered financial aid programs?
Unfortunately Harvard University or GSAS financial aid (including scholarships, work-study, and loans) are not available to non-degree seeking students. Non-degree seeking students who are US citizens or permanent residents are eligible for Sallie Mae loans. Non-US citizens with a cosigner who is a US citizen or permanent resident are also eligible. Please note that it may take several weeks to process a loan, and you cannot register until the funds have been applied to your term bill.Are US special students and visiting fellows eligible for Federal Student Aid?
For US citizens to receive federal aid, they must be enrolled, or plan to enroll, in a degree program of organized instruction that leads to an academic, professional, or vocational degree or certificate. Special students and visiting fellows do not meet this criterion.Is there anything international students should know about funding their stay?
Yes! Many international visiting fellows applying from abroad are funded by a foundation, government entity, organization, or company, as well as being self-funded. All international visiting fellows must demonstrate that they have sufficient funding before applying. Visa authorization is contingent upon the financial certification of funds to cover tuition and living expenses.I have not attended school for quite a while. What do I do about the academic recommendations?
At least two of your three recommendations should come from teachers or professors who recently taught you in academic subjects. If you have not attended school for a number of years, you may ask employers, colleagues, or other individuals who know you well to write your recommendations. You may consider enrolling in some demanding college courses before applying. Your success in those courses will help demonstrate your academic ability and enable you to achieve the strong academic recommendations that Harvard prefers.If I gain admission to the program, may I defer my enrollment?
Deferments are not available for this program. If you are unable to attend the semester to which you were admitted then please e-mail the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Program office immediately; you will need to create new application account and submit a new application. Because this is considered a re-application, all your previously-submitted documents are attached to the new application and no new documents are required. Please note why you were unable to attend when you reapply. If you were admitted for the full academic year but you now plan to only attend in the spring, please  e-mail the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Program office.If I am denied admission, may I reapply?
Yes! But you must submit a new application for admission in a subsequent year. You will also need to submit an additional application fee. Please be aware that GSAS will not accept more than three unsuccessful applications from any individual during the course of their academic career.I’m a current non-degree student at Harvard GSAS, but I would like to extend my stay, is that possible?
Possibly. While the program is intended for a short period of study, you may reapply in order to extend your program. Reapplications are considered on a case-by-case basis. You will need to create new application account and submit a new application. When reapplying, you will not need to submit new supporting materials, however, you may wish to update your statement or add transcripts.Are visiting fellows offered office space in their affiliated department or desk space in the library?
In general, office space is extremely limited, with only a few departments providing offices to visiting fellows. However, you may request a study carrel at Widener Library by submitting a Widener Carrel Request Form. Carrels are free of charge and are assigned on a yearly basis.Are visiting fellows offered laboratory space?
Laboratory space is also limited. Please note any special requirements in your application and discuss whether space is available with your affiliated department.Does the Special Students and Visiting Fellows Office assist in locating housing?
Special students and visiting fellows are responsible for finding their own housing. Most visiting fellows seek off-campus, non-Harvard housing. The Harvard-Cambridge area is highly residential and close to campus. Also, much of the city of Boston (including Allston) is accessible by public transportation, as are the surrounding towns of Arlington, Belmont, Brookline, Somerville, and Watertown. Harvard University Housing also has options to consider.Do on-campus housing options exist?
Visiting fellows and special students are eligible to apply for limited campus housing at the Cronkhite Graduate Center or in the GSAS residence halls, though married couples and other family members cannot be accommodated. Housing applications may be submitted only after academic admission (non-degree students please ignore the deadline as that applies only to degree students). Visit the GSAS Office of Residential Life for more information.Have a spooky October afternoon with the Dudley Literary Fellows' Book Club: Strange Stories on 10/18… https://t.co/gTQAvfAWTwOct 17@HarvardGSAS"It’s like going to a gym and taking a group class instead of running alone on the treadmill.” Learn more about Writing Oasis sessions on 10/17 at the Tozzer Anthropology Bldg

    The Host Student Program helps incoming international students feel welcome and comfortable as they make their transition to life in the United States and as graduate students at GSAS. The program links a continuing GSAS student with one or two incoming international students. Students may be matched in many ways—for example, by age, marital status or sexual orientation, country, field of study, interests or hobbies. We make every effort to match people with their preferences, depending on the students who volunteer to participate.All current GSAS students, from both the United States and abroad, are invited to apply to serve as host students. As a host student, you are not expected to serve as a counselor or academic advisor, but rather as a person to whom a new international student can turn for support and friendly advice.Matches will be made in early June. A Host Student Dinner is scheduled for Monday, August 21, 2017.Become a host student or learn more about the Host Student Program.Have a spooky October afternoon with the Dudley Literary Fellows' Book Club: Strange Stories on 10/18… https://t.co/gTQAvfAWTwOct 17@HarvardGSAS"It’s like going to a gym and taking a group class instead of running alone on the treadmill.” Learn more about Writing Oasis sessions on 10/17 at the Tozzer Anthropology Bldg

They cost the same.A: The Link pass offers unlimited travel on subway and local bus. The Zone1A pass offers the same unlimited coverage as the Link pass with the addition of Zone1A commuter rail stops. See the MBTA Commuter Rail Zone map for more information. Students must pick up their next month’s Zone1A pass towards the end of each month (ex. November’s pass will be picked up at the end of October). Link passes are picked up once each semester. Lastly, lost Link passes may be replaced, whereas lost Zone1A passes may not be replaced; students would have to wait until the next month when they would pick up their next pass.Q: Can I pay for my pass with a check?A: No, all T-pass orders will be charged to the student’s term-bill.Q: When and where can I pick my pass up?A: The Office of Student Affairs will be in touch when the passes are ready for pick-up. For the Fall program, pick-up will occur towards the end of September; for the Spring program, pick-up will occur towards the end of January. Students may pick up their passes in the location – Cambridge or Longwood – designated by them in their order form.Q: What happens if I lose my pass?A: Only bus and Link passes may be replaced by the MBTA. If you have lost a bus or Link pass, please contact the Office of Student Affairs (studaff@fas.harvard.edu) and they will deactivate your lost pass and order a replacement pass on your behalf.Q: Is there summer T-pass coverage?A: No, the MBTA sets the parameters for the Semester Pass Program. The summer months are not part of the program.Q: Can I buy a pass just for a month?A: No, the Semester Pass Program offers coverage for four consecutive months. Students are charged for the entire amount and cannot opt in or out of coverage during the semester.Questions about the MBTA Semester Pass Program?E-mail: studaff@fas.harvard.edu
