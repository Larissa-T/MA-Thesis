Her dissertation explores the interrelations between and among conceptions of genre and national identity in German romantic literature, particularly in the works of Bettine von Arnim, Karoline von Günderrode, J.W. von Goethe, and Friedrich Hölderlin. Her research draws on and expands German feminist scholarship by critiquing depictions of perceived cultural otherness at both the thematic and formal levels. Portions of her dissertation work were completed at the Universität Konstanz on a Fulbright research fellowship from 2015-2016. REBECCA HAUBRICH Rebecca Haubrich received an M.A. in Comparative Literature and German Studies from the Goethe University of Frankfurt (Main) in 2011. In her thesis, she focused on the structural metamorphoses of poetic language from Ovid's artist-myths to their lyrical transformations of the nineteenth and twentieth century. In her dissertation, she plans to explore the relationship between the work of mourning and aesthetics, specifically in writings on psychoanalysis and photography. Before coming to Brown, she was a Visiting Research Scholar at Yale University (2012/13).DANIEL LANGE received his degrees in Comparative Literature, International Women's and Gender History (both 2015), and Romance Studies (2013) from the University of Vienna. He has a particular interest in post-war German and Austrian literature (Aichinger, Mayröcker, Kling), translation and etymology, as well as their cultural implications.JASMIN MEIER studied philosophy, German Studies (BA) and the Ethics of Textual Cultures (MA) in an interdisciplinary degree program that brings together philosophy, German literary studies, linguistics, and religious studies. In her MA thesis, she focused on concepts of hope in Friedrich Nietzsche’s work. Her main current research focus continues to be the work of Nietzsche and its reception—often the subject of misuse or even abuse—in the present and the past. Her perspective derives from an “ethical” point of view and poses questions such as the following: What does it mean to read in an “ethical” manner, and what does this practice exclude? What does the possibility of “unethical” reading tell us about language itself?CHRISTIAN OBST studied Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and Sociology at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, completing his studies with an M.A. thesis exploring the implied theory and politics of metaphor in the writings of Karl Marx. The authors who have informed his research are Hegel, Adorno, Derrida, Blanchot, and Benjamin, along with Musil. Obst, who also spent a year as a visiting scholar at Yale’s German Department, is interested in the ways in which various kinds of texts (literary, philosophical, theological, and essayistic) can be investigated in the medium of their literariness. He is preparing a project that examines the problematic nexus of coinage and characteristic marks in Benjamin and the Book of Esther.MICHAEL PANINSKI studied Theater, Film and Media Studies, German, and Philosophy at the University of Vienna, where he received his M.A. in 2015 with a thesis entitled Hermeneutics Of Failure – Underway to Bertolt Brecht’s Fatzer-fragment. The text analyzes the possibilities of re-reading, re-discovering and re-interpreting the works of Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht in the aftermath of the theoretical conceptions of fragment, detail and discontinuity. Michael Paninski's research interests range from the legacy of the fragmentary demand of the Romantic via the broad operational areas of Critical Theory to current questions in literary theory and continental philosophy. At Brown University he wishes to explore contemporary discourses and narratives of human rights, justice, and violence in the wake of deconstructive theories of literature and language. His questions circle around the incalculable element within language—a critical residual, remnant, or relic (Rest)—and around the question of what happens when the intervention of this Other is not excluded from the calculus or economy of the political.MIRJAM PANINSKI studied Comparative Literature, German Studies, Aesthetics, and the Philosophy of Culture at the University of Vienna. Her research interests include translation and translatability of and within 20th century poetry, the gaps of language, and multilingual literature by authors such as Ilse Aichinger, Ingeborg Bachmann, Yoko Tawada and Gertrude Stein.MIRIAM RAINER received her B.A. in American Studies with a minor in German Studies from the University of Hamburg in 2010 and her M.A. in Comparative Literature from the University of Vienna in 2014. In her M.A. thesis Zögern / Hesitate, she traces the movement of translating and its manifestation in theoretical and literary texts (Walter Benjamin, Paul Celan, Peter Waterhouse, Rosmarie Waldrop). She is co-founder of the collaborative translation project VERSATORIUM. Her research interests include the affiliation between the theory and practice of literary translation, language philosophy, philology, and critical theory.JAN GEORG TABOR  studied German and Philosophy (B.A., 2012), as well as Ethics of Textual Cultures (M.A., 2015) at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the Charles University in Prague. His often crossdisciplinary research interests include literary theory, critical historiography, and institutional sociology/critique. He also is interested in ways of (re)thinking and expanding comparativism. His main fields of investigation have been German Idealism (particularly Hegel) and literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries.Graduate Students from Other DepartmentsThere are many other graduate students at Brown working  towards Ph.D.s in other field but who are active in our department  through their participation in seminars, workshops, and colloquia.NATALIE ADLER (Comparative Literature)Natalie received her B.A. from the Gallatin School of  Individualized Study at NYU. Before coming to Brown, she was an English  teacher at a primary school in Besançon, France.

Filip has an MA in Comparative Literature from Brown University, where he worked on representations of modern violence in the poetry and literature of the European tradition.PETER KIM (English)Peter holds a B.A. in English from UC Berkeley. He is  interested in the relations between literature and philosophy with  regards to critical theory and 19th-Century British literature. Specific  interests include Frankfurt School aesthetics, the Victorian political  novel, and theories of English and German Romanticism.NATALIE LOZINSKI-VEACH  (Comparative Literature)Natalie holds a B.A. in English with a minor in Spanish and a  B.A. in German, both from SUNY New Paltz. She is interested in  animality, posthumanism, feminism, theories of embodiment, reciprocity  and liminality and their relationship to textual bodies and language.  She works on 20th and 21st century literature, with a focus on German  and Polish socialist and post-socialist works.ADAM J SACKS (History)Adam  holds an M.A. from Brown University, a Masters of  Science from the City College of the City University of New York, and a  B.A.  Summa Cum Laude  from Cornell University. In 2011, he was the  Cahnmann Foundation Fellow at the Center for Jewish History in New York  and was awarded the dissertation Grant of the Central European History  Society. He is serving as a fellow of the Studienstiftung des Deutschen  Volkes in 2012 while also a Guest Researcher at the new Reseach Center  for Exile Culture at the Universitaet der Kuenste in Berlin.IAN SAMPSON (English)Ian  is a doctoral student in the English department,  studying Romantic poetry and posthumanist theory. He holds degrees in  English and creative writing from the University of Calgary and Simon  Fraser University, where he wrote an MA thesis about the American  sinologist Ernest Fenollosa and his influence on Ezra Pound. Since  coming to Brown in 2011, he has also become a clandestine Germanist,  reading Hölderlin and Heidegger alongside Wordsworth and Whitehead – a  side-effect, no doubt, of regularly summering with family in Köln.  Beyond Romanticism, his interests include media theory, psychoanalysis,  and the avant-garde.JONATHAN SOZEK (Religion and Critical Thought)Jon received a B.A. in liberal arts from Sarah Lawrence  College in 2003 and an M.A. (honours) in religious studies at McGill  University in 2006.  After working for several years in secondary  education, Jon moved to Belgium to complete a second B.A. (2009) and  M.A. (2010) in philosophy at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.  His  ongoing reserarch interests include the conceptual histories of  'religion' and 'the secular' and of their relation, modern theories of  myth and the politics of mythmaking, political theology, and critical  theory.SETH THORN (Multimedia & Electronic Music Experiments)Seth             studied philosophy, critical theory and viola performance at  Northwestern and  completed an M.A. in political theory at the  Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt am Main.  In addition to his doctoral  pursuits in Brown's Multimedia and Electronic Music Experiments (aka  "MEME") program, Seth has special emphasis on the study of German  philosophy and the philosophy of music and sound where it appears in  that tradition and is working towards an M.A. in German Studies.GEOFFREY WILDANGER (Comparative Literature)Geoffrey Wildanger works at the confluence of art history, literary history, and critical theory. Prior to beginning his PhD at Brown, he received a Master's at the University of California, Davis, and was a Helena Rubinstein Fellow at the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York.

From ancient Egypt and Rome to 18th  century China, historical crime fiction has complemented and contested  our knowledge of history. In this seminar, we will do some extensive  time travel and explore how crime fiction explores the past and  challenges our understanding of bygone times. Readings of texts by Ellis  Peters, Umberto Eco, Peter Tremayne, Lindsey Davis, Alan Gordon, Robert  van Gulik, Laura Rowland, among others.

This course offers a broad introduction to Goethe’s life and works, focusing on themes and questions of youth and childhood in his writings. Readings include canonical works such as The Sorrows of Young Werther, Iphigenia in Tauris, Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship, Faust, and Elective Affinities. We will also examine Goethe’s legacy by looking at musical, theatrical, and philosophical responses to images of youth and childhood in his works. [Taught in German; all students welcome.]S01         TuTh 2:30-3:50      190 Hope 203 GRMN1320O Freudian Inspirations:  Psychoanalysis and the Arts                  Benjamin Brand This course engages with the central concepts and motifs of Freud’s psychoanalytic theory and how they relate to works of literature, art, and film. What do Sophocles, Ovid, and Hoffmann tell us when we read Oedipus Rex, The Metamorphoses, and The Sandman today? How does our understanding of these texts differ from or resemble Freud’s reading of them? And when we engage art that cites psychoanalytic concepts—such as Hitchcock’s Marnie or Lars von Trier’s Melancholia—do we recognize the Freud we encounter in our readings of his own texts? (In English; all students welcome)S01        MWF 10-10:50am      Metacalf Research Bldg 104GRMN1440G Talking Animals and the Politics of World Literature             Christine Ivanovic We have encountered talking animals within literature for over four thousand years. Alongside the Fables of Aesop, there are comparable animal stories from Ancient Babylon, Egypt, and from the Indian-Arabian-Persian cultural space, whose distribution was just as far-reaching. Animal fables appear easy to understand and universally valid. But do we really understand what it means when animals talk in texts? This course will employ current approaches to human-animal-studies alongside concepts of world literature to examine why animals are made to talk, what functions animal stories have, and what the conditions for their dissemination are. [In English; all Brown students welcome.] S01   TuTh 4-5:30pm         Sayles Hall 014 GRMN1440S    Grimms' Fairy Tales                                                                             Kristina Mendicino“One doesn't know the sorts of things one has in one's house," says the servant girl in Kafka's "A Country Doctor," as a stranger emerges from an unused sty who will incorporate the doctor’s own most intimate—and violent—desires. Finding more than one seeks in one's midst is among the core motifs of the Grimms' “Household Tales” that we will trace, following how they move writers of and on literature, psychoanalysis, critical theory, gender, nation, and race. Reading the Grimms, we may find: what was "once upon a time" is not finished, nor can these uncanny tales be domesticated.  In English.S01         MWF 2-2:50      Smith Buonanno G18GRMN1440U    Migrantenliteratur                                                                              Thomas KniescheLiterature written by migrants and their descendants has become a vital part of post-war German language and culture. Since the arrival of the so-called guest workers in the 1950s, the Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union during the 1990s, and recent Syrian refugees, Germany has become an “Einwanderungsland” (a country of immigration) and an increasingly multicultural society. This has triggered anxieties and phobias, exploited by populist politicians and movements, but it has also profoundly changed the literary landscape. The class will explore the contributions of authors such as Rafik Schami, Feridun Zaimoglu, Emine Özdamar, Zafer Senocak, and others.  Taught in German.S01         TuTh  10:30-11:50      190 Hope 203GRMN1440X    Stranger Things:  The German Novella                             Natalie Lozinski-VeachGoethe’s famous description of the novella as an “unheard-of event” holds true to this day: scandals, murder, and the supernatural abound in this seminal German genre. Both meticulously structured and notoriously difficult to define, the novella as a form mirrors the paradoxes of its narratives. In this course, we will ask how form and content come together in the novella to engender strange occurrences that vacillate between everyday experiences and fever dreams. What is it about the German novella that creates such a particular sense of unease, and how does this genre mediate modern experience? [In English. All students welcome.]S01         MWF 12-12:50      J Walter Wilson 201GRMN1660Q  Film and the Third Reich                                                                 Dennis JohannssenThis course explores the cinema of the Third Reich as well as filmic responses to World War II and the Holocaust. Sections will be dedicated to propaganda films by Leni Riefenstahl and others; to the relationship between Third Reich cinema and Hollywood; to propaganda films produced by the Allied forces, and to movies about the Holocaust such as Shoah and Schindler’s List. We will discuss key concepts of film theory, cinema’s political efficacy, Holocaust representation in film, music, and language, and questions of trauma, commemoration, and victimhood. [Taught in English; students from diverse fields welcome.]S01         TuTh 9-10:20    190 Hope 203 SWED0100  Beginning Swedish                                                                                          Ann Weinstein Swedish  100 is an introduction to both Sweden and Swedish, covering various  aspects of Swedish history, art and society, as well as screening at  least three Swedish films per semester. The course packet contains the  text/workbook, Mål 1, with additional materials. We will cover one chapter of Mål per week, with quizzes every three weeks. There will be a midterm and a  final exam, along with a short take-home project.  This is a small  class, so your presence is absolutely required. Emphasis will be placed  on speaking and understanding Swedish. Good will and good humor are required.

Or is it appropriation, acculturation, adoption? Or rather estrangement, alienation, defamiliarization? Next we will investigate different models of derivative, parasitic, and translational writing by authors as diverse as J. Franzen, E. Fried, Ch. Hawkey, E. Jelinek, Y. Tawada, P. Waterhouse, and others. Finally, we will examine translational writing as a means of decolonizing world literature.

Through close readings of key texts that address the rich and vexed concept of “tradition”—Arendt’s Between Past and Future, relevant passages from Heidegger’s Being and Time, Adorno’s “On Tradition” and pertinent sections from Negative Dialectics—we will address issues of fundamental significance to critical thought today. To interrogate the concept of tradition, we also will attempt to understand the stakes of Arendt’s and Adorno’s fundamentally divergent interpretations of Benjamin’s philosophy of history.  [Seminar will be taught in English.

Sebald have received a huge amount of critical attention since his death in 2001, particularly from critics interested in the question of the ethics of literature after Auschwitz. But what is Sebald’s literary heritage, and who are his interlocutors? What internal and external connections do his works establish? Besides Sebald’s works, readings will include Stendhal, Kafka, Walser, Borges, Bergson, Resnais, Lanzmann. Banner registrations after classes begin require instructor approval.

Through a careful reading of primary texts by Hobhouse, Nietzsche, Weber, and Freud. The course explores issues such as the rise of mass consumer culture, neoliberal and neofascist politics, philosophic irrationalism, psychoanalysis, and the woman question. WRIT Mary Gluck S01 MWF 12pm-12:50pm HIST1240A Politics of Violence in 20th Century EuropeEurope's 20th century saw the emergence of forms of violence unthinkable in a world without mass politics. To better understand the changes in European states and societies that gave rise to total war and the violence associated with totalizing ideologies such as fascism and communism, we will read Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Fanon and others who sought to interpret violence as an extension of ideology. We will also read selections from more recent works by state leaders, historians and cultural figures from Ukraine to France, from Turkey to Great Britain who have reinterpreted past violence for present political ends.

Louis Jodry       S01   TTh 9am-10:20am  PHIL0050: Aesthetics: Art and Morality From Plato to the present, the power of the arts to trigger powerful emotions has been seen by some thinkers as a threat to morality, by others as a vital support. This debate raises such issues as whether aesthetic experience is a distinctive kind of experience and whether the creation and reception of art are autonomous activities free from the constraints of morality and politics. Beyond Plato, authors to be read will include such figures as Hume, Mendelssohn, Rousseau, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Ruskin, Tolstoy, Collingwood, Stanley Cavell, Martha Nussbaum, Alexander Nehamas, and others.

WRITS01         MWF      10-10:50GRMN1200G  Writers in Exile:  Fascism in America                                        Kristina MendicinoHaving fled Nazi Germany, Ernst Bloch wrote of fascism from his latest location: “The masks of the Ku Klux Klan were thus the first fascist uniform, and its proclamations were the first to colour with their wishful images the 'revolution' from the right, the Lynch revolution. The beginning of the movement is instructive here.” And he was not the only one among the many diverse European writers in American exile to be reminded of the political, social, technocratic, and economic formations s/he was seeking to escape.  Even Thomas Mann, the erstwhile guest at the White House and bourgeois advocate of democracy in America, aroused the suspicions of the FBI and his public enemies, ultimately finding himself provoked to view in Cold War politics tendencies toward a “fascist dictatorship.” In this course, we will closely read a selection of the texts that emerged from German writers in exile with a view to their implications regarding fascism and American culture.  In English.S01        TBDGRMN1440V  Armut/Poverty                                                                                          Thomas SchestagEros, according to a legend told by Diotima in Plato’s Symposium, is the son of Poverty – Penia – and Resoure – Poros –. Poverty is the other side of the development of (economic, linguistic) wealth and riches. Our seminar will unfold certain aspects of (the love for) this other side. Readings include texts by Bonaventura (Apologia pauperum/Defense of the Mendicants), Hans Sachs (Die tugentreich fraw Armut), Heinrich Heine (Die schlesischen Weber), Franz Grillparzer (Der arme Spielmann); fairy tales by the Grimm brothers; Karl Marx; Bertolt Brecht (Vom armen B.B.), Walter Benjamin (Erfahrung und Armut), and Martin Heidegger (Die Armut).S01         TuTh      10:30-11:50    GRMN1892     Kafka and the Philosophers                                                                  Gerhard RichterKafka’s writings take as a central concern  the philosophical interpretability of what we call literature. What is  one to make, for instance, of a text that begins with a protagonist  awakening one morning to realize that he has been transformed into a  monstrous vermin? Or another awakening protagonist unexpectedly detained  by officers waiting in his apartment? For Kafka, “correct understanding  of something and misunderstanding of the same thing are not entirely  mutually exclusive.” We will study some of Kafka’s greatest texts  alongside key attempts at interpreting Kafka philosophically, including  Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, Deleuze/Guattari, and Agamben.  In English; diverse fields welcome.S01     M     3-5:30GRMN1900K  Heinrich Heine und Deutschland                                                   Thomas Kniesche  Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) has filled many roles in the history of German culture: a poet who wrote some of the most “Romantic” poems in the German language; an author who effortlessly switched between journalistic and literary writing; and a “wound” (Theodor W. Adorno) that cannot stop refusing to heal. We will conduct extensive readings from Heine’s poetic, essayistic, and narrative oeuvre which will result not only in a better understanding of the development of post-classical German literature, but also in a deeper knowledge of German culture as a whole.S01         MWF      2-2:50SWED0200  Beginning Swedish                                                                                         Ann WeinsteinSwedish  200 is a continuation of Swedish 100, with the same goals, materials  and methods.

Our seminar will reconsider the Homeric question as it unfolds in Giambattista Vico (Scienza nuova), and Friedrich August Wolff (Prolegomena ad Homerum); its transformation in Nietzsche’s inaugural lecture; and the continuous quest for philology in Nietzsche’s later writings.                                                 S01           W   3-5:30GRMN2661L      Speaking of Appearance:  Phenomenology and Its Fictions                                                                                                                                                 Kristina MendicinoHow does Husserl’s oeuvre open other ways to think through the relation of language and phenomena than those admitted by the traditions of predicative logic he receives? In Erfahrung und Urteil, for example, he turns to the one of the foundational problems that lies at the basis of all cognizant experience: the original apprehension of all the givens we take for granted, from objects of experience to the ways in which we tend to get a grip on them, will have always been forgotten. Hence, he seeks to retrace the passive syntheses that form the preconditions for every thesis on the world and every intentional cognitive act. For Husserl, this radical pre-logical and pre-ontological questioning of origins—which would be further pursued in important, divergent ways by Heidegger and Derrida, among others—should issue into a firmer establishment of logic. But the investigation that follows rests on a fiction— “wir machen eine Fiktion eines Subjektes,” Husserl writes in his introduction—and phenomenology, thus becomes contingent, at least in part, upon poetics in a fashion that opens other inroads into the analyses and methodological innovations that Husserl performs, which we will pursue in this course via close readings of Husserl’s writing, among others, such as Sextus Empiricus, René Descartes, and Samuel Beckett, who poses the question in The Unnameable: “These notions of forebears, of houses where lamps are lit at night, and other such, where do they come to me from?”   In English. S01           TBD       Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownFor a listing of current courses, see our COURSES page.GRMN2340B Poetik der AutorInnen (T. Kniesche) This course will examine postwar literary aesthetics as put forth in the so-called "Poetikvorlesungen" which several universities in German-speaking countries have instituted since 1959. These lectures have featured important contemporary authors thinking about their work - from poetic practices and aesthetic theories to biographic considerations and the technicalities of writing literature in today's world.GRMN2460B German Literature 1968-1989 (T. Kniesche) Discussion of major trends in literature written in German: New Subjectivity, postmodernism, feminist literature, the role of mythology, post-histoire. Authors include Botho Strauss, Elfriede Jelinek, Thomas Bernhard, W.G. Sebald, among others.GRMN2660J Late Heidegger: Art, Poetry, Technology (G. Richter) This seminar will focus on key statements in some of the late Heidegger's most influential essays and lectures, with a focus on the nexus of art, poetry, and technology as it inflects language, dwelling, and Being. While in his thinking of art and poetry his emphasis is on the work of Hölderlin, in his thinking of technology he regards the enframement of technics as both completing and undoing Western metaphysics. For Heidegger, the essence of technology is not technological at all but instead requires a wholly different kind of questioning.GRMN2660K Ontology of Life: Reading Heidegger's Being and Time with Derrida (G. Richter and D. Krell) Martin Heidegger's Being and Time (1927) develops a "fundamental ontology" of Dasein, or human existence. Dasein, which in each case dies, is for the time being alive. How does mortal human being relate to other life forms? We will read Heidegger's masterpiece in its entirety with this question in mind, a question sharply honed by Jacques Derrida in his Of Spirit, Aporias, and The Beast and the Sovereign, that is, from the 1980s until his death in 2004.GRMN2660A On the Sublime (Z. Sng) Survey of major theories of the sublime from antiquity to modern times, with emphasis on German, British, and French texts from the 18th to 20th centuries. Authors include Longinus, Immanuel Kant, Edmund Burke, Jean-Francois Lyotard, and Neil Hertz.GRMN 2660L - Hölderlin, in Theory (Z. Sng) We will spend the semester reading the enigmatic writings of Friedrich Hoelderlin, with particular focus on the pivotal role that he has come to play in major philological and philosophical projects of our time. Critical readings include texts by Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, de Man, and Lacoue-Labarthe.IN RELATED DEPARTMENTSHIST 2980W - First Person History in Times of Crisis: Witnessing, Memory, Fiction (O. Bartov) This seminar examines the relationship between History as a narrative of events and history as individual experience. Postulating that historical events as related by historians were experienced in numerous different ways by their protagonists, the seminar focuses on the complementary and contradictory aspects of this often fraught relationship at times of crisis, especially in war and genocide. While much time will be spent on World War II and the Holocaust, the seminar will engage with other modern wars and genocides across the world. Materials will include eyewitness reports, postwar testimonies and trial records, memoirs and relevant works of fiction.COLT 2821B - Memory/Commemoration/Testimony (S. Bernstein) An investigation of the mnemonic functions of poetry from the elegy to historical witnessing in the Romantic and post-romantic period. We will study the creative and performative function of memory as well as processes of repetition, recollection, trauma and canon-formation. Theoretical and poetic texts will be studied together. Authors will include: Rousseau, Wordsworth, Hölderlin, Lamartine, Baudelaire, Dickinson, H.D., Rilke, Celan, Reznikoff; Heidegger, Freud, Arendt, Adorno, Derrida, de Man, Ronell.HMAN 2970H - Realism, Idealism, and Modernity I: From Early Modernity through German Idealism (P. Guyer) Debates between realism and idealism are central to modernity. The opposition between them might seem straightforward, realism being the philosophy of the scientific worldview, idealism the philosophy of more traditional religion and morality. But sometimes idealism has been the philosophical basis for modern science and moral autonomy, and realism the basis for more traditional worldviews. The philosophical debate between realism and idealism is thus part of the larger struggle over science, religion, morality and politics in modern culture. This course will begin a two-semester study of this complex dialectic from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries.COLT2820S - Poetry after Kant (K. McLaughlin) Begins with the intensive study of a selection of writings by Kant focused especially on force and conflict in politics and aesthetics. This study, along with relevant readings from more recent work, will provide the basis for an approach to this topic in nineteenth-century poetry. Readings of Kant, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, and Giorgio Agamben, leading to several "case studies" of 19th--century poetry, including works by Hölderlin, Baudelaire, and Matthew Arnold.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownA total of 13 courses are required.  Among these shall be:LANG 2900 (taught by the Director of the Center for Language Studies) - "The Theory and Practice of Foreign Language Learning and Teaching"4 courses in a secondary field of study, usually consisting of a sequence of courses in another Ph.D. program at Brown, such as Comparative Literature, History, Music, Theater Arts & Performance Studies, Philosophy, MCM, and History of Art & Architecture.Graduate students at the course-taking stage are required to take a minimum of 2 graduate seminars per semester in the Department of German Studies.  Requests for exception to this policy must be approved by both the DGS and the Department Chair.At the beginning of each academic term, graduate students will meet with the Director of Graduate Studies in order to discuss their progress and to have their proposed coursework for the respective semester approved.Students may fulfill this requirement in one of two ways:1)  demonstrate reading proficiency in two languages (other than English and German) by taking the reading exams in those department at Brown; or2) complete a 1000-level course in one foreign literature department at Brown.  This course must be taught in the respective language.The language requirement must be satisfied before a student presents himself or herself for the qualifying examination.The qualifying examination consists of two parts: 1) a general examination and 2) a specialized fields examination based on two reading lists prepared by the candidate.The first part of the examination, the general exam, takes place at the end of the first semester in the student’s third year. It is a 90-minute oral examination based on a standing departmental list of 35 canonical works drawn from the tradition of German literary writing and critical thought. This standing list will be made available to the student by the Director of Graduate Studies upon entry into the program. The departmental faculty as a whole will administer this portion of the examination.The second part of the examination takes place at the end of the second semester of the student’s third year. It is based on two lists compiled by the candidate in consultation with his or her dissertation advisor and a 3-person examination committee, of which the primary advisor is normally a part. (Students will nominate a primary dissertation advisor by the end of the fourth semester, and choose a 3-person examination committee in consultation with the advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies.) In this second part of the qualifying examination, one list will be the “Literature List,” the other the “Theory List.” Students are encouraged to choose non-contiguous areas of inquiry for the two lists. Each of these specialized lists will be accompanied by a statement outlining the candidate’s main ideas, questions, and theses in relation to the chosen scholarly problem, topic, or approach. Final versions of these two statements and lists must be submitted to the members of the examination committee at least 3 weeks before the examination is to be administered.Based on these lists and statements, the committee will prepare a question in relation to each of the two areas that the lists address. The candidate will receive the question for the first list on a Friday by noon; he or she will then have until 5:00 p.m. the following Monday to prepare and submit his or her written answer, which will normally be between 10 and 15 pages. The following Friday, he or she will receive the question for the second list, again by noon; he or she will then have once again until 5:00 p.m. the following Monday to prepare and submit his or her written answer to the second question, which will normally be between 10 and 15 pages.By the first Friday after the second part of the written examination, a two-hour oral examination based on the written responses will be held.Students will be assigned either "Pass with Honors," "Pass," or "Fail" for the qualifying examination.Upon successful completion of the qualifying examination, graduate students are eligible to be awarded the M.A. in German Studies.Should a candidate fail to pass the qualifying examination or a portion thereof, he or she will be allowed to take the examination (or the portion that was failed) one more time during the following semester. If a candidate fails a second time, the result is termination.After successfully completing the qualifying examination, the student shall, in consultation with his or her primary dissertation advisor, nominate two other dissertation readers. By the end of the first week of the fall semester in the fourth year of study, the student shall present a substantive written dissertation proposal.The exact format of the proposal will be determined by the primary advisor, but it will generally be between 15 and 20 pages in length, and include a tentative chapter outline and preliminary bibliography. The proposal will be examined orally by the three members of the dissertation committee by the end of that semester. The committee will either approve the proposal or recommend revisions. Once the proposal is approved, the student will be advanced to Ph.D. candidacy.After the dissertation has been completed and accepted by all three members of the dissertation committee, a dissertation defense takes place, consisting of a public presentation and discussion of the thesis. The date of the defense is selected in consultation with the dissertation committee. The defense will begin with an oral presentation by the candidate, offering a brief overview of the main theses and structure of the dissertation (usually 15-30 minutes). This presentation will be followed by a 60– to 90– minute discussion in which the candidate responds to questions posed by the committee, and, if present, other faculty. At the end of the defense, members of the committee consult and vote on whether to pass the dissertation. The Graduate School requires that the dissertation be accepted by all three readers before the doctoral degree can be awarded.Students are required to teach for at least two years, though the norm will be higher.Graduate student teaching is an important component of our doctoral program. As teaching assistants, graduate students work with the Language Program Director to teach beginning and intermediate German. Graduate students are required to take a seminar on language pedagogy and to participate in annual teaching workshops held in August. As graduate students progress in their program, they will assist faculty in undergraduate courses in the German Studies Department. Advanced students may be offered the opportunity to work with professors to design their own upper-level courses or to teach such a course with a professor. Faculty mentoring of teaching assistants throughout their course of study is an integral part of our program. Students will be prepared to present a comprehensive teaching portfolio when they enter the job market.In addition to the language-specific training administered by the German Studies Department, all graduate students are encouraged to participate in the seminars and workshops offered by Brown’s Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. The Center offers a teaching certificate program through which graduate students may be awarded Certificate I, II, and III.The Goethe Institut Boston also periodically offers pedagogy workshops that graduate students are encouraged to attend.Advanced students will be offered the opportunity to work with professors to design their own upper-level courses or teach such a course with a professor.Students are expected to organize and participate in student-run colloquia. Graduate students and faculty from other departments working in the area of German Studies may be invited to participate in these. Students will also have the opportunity to present their own work and invite the occasional Brown or non-Brown speaker.Unfailing attendance at all academic lectures by guest speakers, symposia, special seminars, conferences, etc. organized by the Department of German Studies is expected of all graduate students, regardless of their stage in the program. This opportunity for scholarly exchange is an integral part of their graduate education and an important element in the Department’s intellectual culture.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWe expect our graduate students to participate in the Cogut Humanities Center at Brown University. The Center organizes events such as lecture series, symposia and conferences and also provides a number of fellowship opportunities to faculty and graduate students.Students are also encouraged to become engaged in the activities of the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning and to build strong teaching portfolios with the help of the Center and by availing themselves of departmental resources such as supervised teaching.The department has a co-tutelle agreement with the University of Tübingen that allows students to pursue a combined Dr. phil. / Ph.D. degree. Students interested in this option should contact the Director of Graduate Studies upon entering the program.Graduate students in their third or fourth years have the option to apply for a one-semester stay at the  Humboldt University in Berlin. In their application, they must state clearly why their research would benefit from spending a semester in Berlin and whom they have chosen as their mentor while at the Humboldt University. A letter in support of the project from the mentor should accompany the application.The John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library is the primary teaching and research library for the humanities at Brown. It has an excellent collection in German Studies and related fields of interest. Various other specialized collections are located in the John Hay Library, the Orwig Music Library, and the Art Slide Library. Brown University participates in a collaboration with other research libraries in the New England area so that faculty and students have access to any material they might need.The Department regularly welcomes a Max Kade Distinguished Visiting Professor of German Studies who teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the program.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of German Studies at Brown University opens the  doors to students who are interested in the language, literature, and  culture of the German speaking areas of Central Europe. We offer a  curriculum which combines intensive study of the German language with an  interdisciplinary approach to German culture. These opportunities  prepare our students to understand both changing approaches to cultural  studies as well as the changes in European and world affairs that will  affect our ways of life in the next century.Since the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Germany's growing economic  and political influence has manifested itself worldwide. Unified  Germany is one of the driving forces of European unification, a process  that will be a central factor in world economics and politics in the  next century. The study of German history and culture will therefore be a  major asset to students considering careers in many fields as well as  in further study in graduate school.Language courses in the Department of German Studies are culturally  motivated from the beginning, stressing an integral approach to  building language skills and to understanding the German cultural  environment. Ample conversation practice is provided, along with  exposure to a variety of texts, including literature, film, music, and  German television. In addition, German-language sections of courses in  other departments are periodically offered, such as History, Political  Science, and History of Art and Architecture. At times, we are able to offer German for  Reading Knowledge, aimed at graduate students who need to satisfy a  language requirement (check the Course Announcement). Furthermore, the  Department also offers courses in the Swedish language.The quest for national identity that dominated German history in  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been augmented by  contemporary Germany's efforts both to come to terms with its past and  to create new ways of dealing with diversity. Our curriculum thus looks  back at the German literary, cultural, and historical tradition, from  Goethe to Christa Wolf and including figures such as Marx, Freud,  Nietzsche, and Heidegger, whose texts form the building blocks for  contemporary discussions in such diverse fields as cultural criticism,  women's studies, ethnography, and minority studies. At the same time, we  also concentrate on current developments in this country which perhaps  illustrate more clearly than in many other places the extreme ruptures  of twentieth century history: the consequences in all spheres of the  reunification of the socialist East with the capitalist West, as well as  trends towards a more multicultural society after the opening up of  national borders.We invite students to:"Learn my language. Investigate my culture. Meet me. And get to know yourself." Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Concentration in German Studies offers students an  interdisciplinary approach to German culture in a wide variety of areas.  Along with courses from the German Studies core program, students have  the opportunity to take courses from other departments and programs that  deal with topics from the German cultural tradition (including History,  History of Art and Architecture, Judaic Studies, Modern Culture and  Media, Music, Philosophy, Political Science). Many students elect to  complete a double concentration, combining German Studies with one of  the above areas, or with fields such as International Relations or  Economics, Comparative Literature or History of Art and Architecture.Concentrators are expected to develop a course of study that will  meet their particular needs and interests. In order to do this, students  select an area of focus for their concentration, in consultation with  the concentration advisor and other appropriate faculty. They should  select at least three advanced courses in this area.A knowledge of the German language is not required for declaring a  concentration in German Studies. However, since language fluency is the  basis for sophisticated understanding of German culture, students must  meet a language requirement by the time they graduate.In many of our German Studies courses, we work closely with our individual students to improve their writing by requiring frequent short written assignments over the course of the semester, which we evaluate and return to them with corrections and suggestions for improvement. We also regularly require students to revise and resubmit writing assignments, in consultation with the instructors. Such practices allow students to become more aware of their strengths and weaknesses as writers, and to receive concrete feedback that assists them in improving current and future written work. In addition, many of our courses are based on close textual analysis. Through this emphasis in our curriculum, students increase their awareness of rhetorical and stylistic strategies during class discussion in ways that train them to become more sensitive readers and writers. Students who opt to fulfill their second WRIT requirement by submitting work done within the German Studies concentration will be permitted to do so. These students should consult the instructor of the course for which this written work is to be completed early in the semester in which they take the course. The instructor of the course will perform the evaluation of the written work, both for the course itself and for the satisfaction of the WRIT requirement.Candidates for honors will be expected to have a superior record in  departmental courses and will have to be approved by the Department of  German Studies. Honors candidates must take one additional course at the  1000-level from the German studies offerings and present an acceptable  Senior Honors Thesis. The additional course may be used for preparation  of the honors thesis. Students are encouraged to discuss their thesis  topics with the concentration advisor no later than the third week of  classes in Fall of their Senior year. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe department offers beginning and intermediate courses (GRMN 0100-  GRMN 0400) where students learn to read, write and converse in German.  Intensive Beginning German (GRMN 0110) allows the student to complete  beginning German in one semester. After successfully completing GRMN 0400, students may  elect coursework depending upon their interests. GRMN 0500 and GRMN 0600  are designed to integrate further intensive work on language skills  with semester-long introductions to aspects of German culture.There is no required sequencing among courses beginning with  GRMN 0500. Students must  complete GRMN 0500 or get permission from the instructor to proceed to  any course above that which is taught in German. Naturally,  courses taught in English are open to all.Courses above GRMN 0600 are taught in German or in English and are designed to allow students to pursue specialized interests such as literature, film, media theory, theater studies, aesthetics, philosophy, etc. These courses are mostly discussion-oriented, and students are encouraged to engage critically with both primary and secondary texts.Consult the concentration advisor Kristina_Mendicino@brown.edu, for advice about which courses are most appropriate for you.Please consult the Dean of the College's orientation material or the German Studies website for time and place. At other times of the year, students should contact the department manager to schedule an exam.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

Every year students who  have excelled in German, demonstrated a strong interest in German  culture and completed at least two years of college are inducted into  this society.Teaching ApprenticesEvery Spring semester the Department of German Studies employs four  undergraduate Teaching Apprentices for GM 0110 (Intensive Beginning  German). Under the supervision of a faculty member, these students are  responsible for teaching small conversation sections three times per  week. These Teaching Apprentices will normally have studied abroad in  Germany, and they should be able to transmit their enthusiasm for  learning German to their students. Contact German_Studies@brown.edu.TutorsEach semester, several students are normally hired to work as tutors  for two or three hours per week. The tutors meet with individual  students who would like extra help with conversation or any other aspect  of language learning. Contact German_Studies@brown.edu.Summer English teaching in GermanyOccasionally the department is able to facilitate one or two  opportunities to teach English in a rural setting in one of the new  German states for a month in the summer. Home stay makes this program  attractive to students of German. Contact Jane_Sokolosky@brown.edu. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of German Studies encourages all students to study  in Germany for one or two semesters. We offer a Brown in Berlin program at the Humboldt University that you can read more about here. Applications are available from the Office of International Programs and are due at the beginning of October for study in the second semester. For more information please contact Jane_Sokolosky@brown.edu.Transfer Credit: For a full semester’s worth of credit at Brown, students studying in Germany are expected to complete 4 courses for evaluation each semester.   Since German professors are not always expected to evaluate each student in their course, Brown program students must be sure to arrange in advance for four Scheine per semester in the courses they take for credit.  The maximum credit that students may transfer from study abroad is four Brown credits per semester (eight per year).Housing: Students find housing in apartments of their choosing. Students may choose to rent on their own or in shared housing. Apartments are available in close proximity to the university and in desirable neighborhoods. Students receive a monthly stipend toward housing.On-site Coordinator: The on-site coordinator is responsible for coordinating the program in Germany. Your first contact with the on-site coordinator will be upon arriving in Germany, where you will be picked up and brought to the orientation program. This invaluable resource helps students with all organizational matters related to registering at the university. Throughout the semester, the coordinator arranges for monthly meetings and one longer group excursion. In addition to these meetings the on-site coordinator keeps in contact with students through cell phones issued to students as part of the program. The on-site coordinator also organizes the language/orientation program and is usually one of the instructors. He also assists students in finding housing.Orientation in Berlin: Students participate in a four-week long orientation/language program run by the on-site coordinator and taught by qualified instructors. Courses focus on preparing students for academic life at the Humboldt University. Students are placed into language courses according to skill level. Time is spent out of class, familiarizing students with the university and exploring the city.Study in the fall semester only is not possible through the OIP due to the German academic calendar. Our students have in the past spent Fall semester in Germany through other programs such as Duke in Berlin. For information about internships and scholarships, please consult this document.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
