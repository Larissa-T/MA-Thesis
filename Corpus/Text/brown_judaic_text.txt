          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownStudents, Professor David Jacobson, and Tour Guide Ilan Bloch on a hilltop overlooking Israel's Negev region.With the generous support of a Global Experiential Learning and Teaching (GELT) Grant from the Office of Global Engagement and additional funds provided by the Program in Judaic Studies, the twelve Brown juniors and seniors in my seminar, “The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Contested Narratives,” spent seven days beginning shortly before Spring Break touring the land both peoples claim to be their own and hearing a wide range of Palestinian and Israeli voices expressing their understanding of the history of the conflict and the hopes and fears they experience after so many decades of fighting.During the weeks leading up to the trip, the seminar was devoted to exploring the narratives of the conflict, the conflicting stories that each side tells each other and the world about how the conflict began, why it has persisted, and whether there is any viable way to resolve it.  The sources of these narratives included historical documents, works of fiction, and feature films.   Well-equipped with knowledge of the conflict, the students greatly deepened their understanding during the week of the trip, and the new insights they discovered have informed their continued study of the conflict upon their return to campus.Highlights of the trip included a bus tour around Jerusalem led by the NGO City of Peoples, dedicated to educating the public about the impact of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on the city that each people claims as its capital; a walking tour of the religious sites in the Old City of Jerusalem holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims; a visit to Mount Herzl in Jerusalem to view the graves of Israeli soldiers who died in battle and of prominent Israeli leaders, as well as the tomb of Theodor Herzl, seen by Israelis as the founding father of Zionism; visits to the tomb of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and a museum dedicated to Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in Ramallah on the West Bank; a visit to Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum; a tour of Lifta, a village abandoned by Palestinians in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War; a visit to Arab Bedouin towns in Israel’s Negev region, where students learned about ongoing land disputes between the Israeli government and local residents;  a tour of parts of the ancient port city of Jaffa and the modern Israeli city of Tel Aviv; and dinner at the home of a Palestinian family.  At lunch in Ramallah students had the opportunity to meet and speak with Sami Jarbawi ’12, a Palestinian who worked with me on the UTRA in which the course was designed. Conversations with Israeli and Palestinian speakers provided a fascinating exposure to conflicting world views between these enemy peoples and within each people.  Two Israeli political figures analyzed the Israeli parliamentary election which took place right before we arrived: Dani Dayan, a right-wing supporter of the re-election of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and Mosi Raz, who ran on the ticket of the left-wing Meretz Party.  Bob Lang, a religious West-Bank Jewish settler in Efrat, shared with us the settler narrative which supports the right of Jews to settle in the area known as the West Bank, occupied by Israel in 1967, while Eliaz Cohen, a religious West-Bank Jewish settler in Kfar Etzion, told of his vision of how Israeli and Palestinian national aspirations could be achieved in the West Bank without anyone having to be uprooted.  Riman Barakat of the think tank Israel Palestine Creative Regional Initiatives (IPCRI) in Jerusalem also told of a similar plan her organization is developing.  Reverend AlexAwad of East Jerusalem told about the unique experiences of the Christian Palestinian minority, while Islamic Scholar Dr. Mustafa Abu Sway of Al Quds University in Jerusalem spoke passionately about the need to end Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, but he also made clear that he believed national identities were human constructs and therefore long-standing arguments about the legitimacy of Israeli and Palestinian rights to the land were beside the point. Students learned of the national tragedies that continue to haunt both peoples, the Holocaust for Israelis and the Nakba defeat of 1948 for the Palestinians.  Holocaust survivor Rina Quint told the amazing story of her survival as a child in a concentration camp and declared that a central message of the Holocaust is that there must be a State of Israel that can serve as a refuge for persecuted Jews.  Amal Jadou of the Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry told of her moving experience going with her father to see the home in West Jerusalem that he left during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Vivian Rabia narrated the story of how a house in the Israeli town of Ramle abandoned by a Palestinian family in the 1948 War was turned into a preschool to serve Palestinian children.Students were particularly moved by their meetings with Palestinians and Israelis who are trying to bridge the social, cultural, and political gaps between the two peoples.  Israeli Rami Elhanan told of the Parents Circle Family Forum that brings together Israelis and Palestinians who have lost loved ones in the conflict.  Nomika Zion, a resident of the Israeli town of Sderot on the border of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which has suffered greatly in Palestinian rocket attacks during the past several years, informed the group of an Israeli organization called Other Voice which makes regular contact by telephone with residents of the Gaza Strip.  Vivian Rabia of Ramle told of the challenges she faces directing a Palestinian-Israeli summer day camp outside of Jerusalem.  Rabbi Daniel Roth of the Pardes Center for Judaism and Conflict Resolution told of his efforts to get Jews to rethink their views of their Arab enemies.The trip was organized by MEJDI Tours, which specializes in dual-narrative trips to Israel/Palestine.  The tour was led by Palestinian guide Jalal Ghazi Awad and Israeli guide Ilan Bloch, who shared their extensive expertise and at times demonstrated the contested nature of Palestinian and Israeli narratives by arguing openly about how to evaluate the ways each people has acted in the past.It is clear from all that we saw and heard that for the most part neither Israelis nor Palestinians are currently optimistic about any breakthrough toward peace in the immediate future.  Perhaps the starkest assessment of the situation was expressed by Dr. Mustafa Abu Sway, who declared in reference to the possibility of a resolution of the conflict: “I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, I don’t even see the tunnel.”   At the same time,  we learned, the pessimism that prevails among both Palestinians and Israelis is constantly challenged by those who attempt to bring together people from both sides of the divide and those who dream of alternative solutions.Students enthusiastically appreciated the rare opportunity that they had to  participate in this informative study tour.  As Jason Ginsberg ’16 observed: “Reading a textbook is one thing, but this program truly offered me the opportunity to live that textbook—to see the issues in the land as a class in real time.  It is a rare gift to be able to engage with material in this way.”   Students came back from the trip with new insights, and in some cases the trip radically changed their views of the conflict. “To say that the course and the study tour transformed the way I think about the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict would be an understatement,” declared Hannah Acheson Field ’15. Joao Nascimento ‘15 saw the study tour as “an opportunity to unlearn my previously entrenched ideas about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians as much as it was a chance to better understand and see for myself the myriad narratives that animate their dispute.”  Reem Rayef ’15 spoke of the impact meeting the people of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had on her: “This trip complicated everything I knew—or thought I knew—about the conflict, by providing us with the invaluable opportunity to make our course readings come alive in their natural context.”Submitted by Professor David JacobsonProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWednesday, September 13, 2017: David Grossman, A Horse Walks Into a BarIn a little dive in a small Israeli city, Dov Greenstein, a comedian a bit past his prime, is doing a night of stand-up. In the audience is a district court justice, Avishai Lazar, whom Dov knew as a boy, along with a few others who remember Dov as an awkward, scrawny kid who walked on his hands to confound the neighborhood bullies. Gradually, as it teeters between hilarity and hysteria, Dov’s patter becomes a kind of memoir, taking us back into the terrors of his childhood: we meet his beautiful flower of a mother, a Holocaust survivor in need of constant monitoring, and his punishing father, a striver who had little understanding of his creative son. Finally, recalling his week at a military camp for youth—where Lazar witnessed what would become the central event of Dov’s childhood—Dov describes the indescribable while Lazar wrestles with his own part in the comedian’s story of loss and survival. Continuing his investigations into how people confront life’s capricious battering, and how art may blossom from it, Grossman delivers a stunning performance in this memorable one-night engagement (jokes in questionable taste included).Wednesday, November 8, 2017:  Aaron Hughes, Jacob Neusner: An American Jewish IconoclastJacob Neusner (born 1932) is one of the most important figures in the shaping of modern American Judaism. He was pivotal in transforming the study of Judaism from an insular project only conducted by—and of interest to—religious adherents to one which now flourishes in the secular setting of the university. He is also one of the most colorful, creative, and difficult figures in the American academy. But even those who disagree with Neusner’s academic approach to ancient rabbinic texts have to engage with his pioneering methods.  In this comprehensive biography, Aaron Hughes shows Neusner to be much more than a scholar of rabbinics.  He is a social commentator, a post-Holocaust theologian, and was an outspoken political figure during the height of the cultural wars of the 1980s. Neusner’s life reflects the story of what happened as Jews migrated to the suburbs in the late 1940s, daring to imagine new lives for themselves as they successfully integrated into the fabric of American society. It is also the story of how American Jews tried to make sense of the world in the aftermath of the extermination of European Jewry and the subsequent creation of the State of Israel in 1948, and how they sought to define what it meant to be an American Jew.  Unlike other great American Jewish thinkers, Neusner was born in the U.S., and his Judaism was informed by an American ethos. His Judaism is open, informed by and informing the world. It is an American Judaism, one that has enabled American Jews—the freest in history—to be fully American and fully Jewish.Wednesday, February 7, 2018:  Benjamin Sommer, Revelation and Authority: Sinai in Jewish Scripture and TraditionAt once a study of biblical theology and modern Jewish thought, this volume describes a “participatory theory of revelation” as it addresses the ways biblical authors and contemporary theologians alike understand the process of revelation and hence the authority of the law. Benjamin Sommer maintains that the Pentateuch’s authors intend not only to convey God’s will but to express Israel’s interpretation of and response to that divine will. Thus Sommer’s close readings of biblical texts bolster liberal theologies of modern Judaism, especially those of Abraham Joshua Heschel and Franz Rosenzweig. This bold view of revelation puts a premium on human agency and attests to the grandeur of a God who accomplishes a providential task through the free will of the human subjects under divine authority. Yet, even though the Pentateuch’s authors hold diverse views of revelation, all of them regard the binding authority of the law as sacrosanct. Sommer’s book demonstrates why a law-observant religious Jew can be open to discoveries about the Bible that seem nontraditional or even antireligious.Wednesday, April 18, 2018:  Cynthia Baker, JewJew.  The word possesses an uncanny power to provoke and unsettle. For millennia, Jew has signified the consummate Other, a persistent fly in the ointment of Western civilization’s grand narratives and cultural projects. Only very recently, however, has Jew been reclaimed as a term of self-identification and pride.   --  Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownJews have lived and flourished over thousands of years in a variety of social contexts, stretching from the Land of Israel and the eastern Mediterranean to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Judaic studies concentrators will have the opportunity to study Jews in these contexts, getting to know their social structures, and what they have created. The subjects of study cover an astonishing range, including Jewish history and society, Jewish law and philosophy, Jewish literature and ritual. Students will learn to unlock this wealth in both the ancient and the modern worlds through a number of academic disciplines - History, Religious Studies, and Literature. These also provide tools for studying and analyzing human societies and cultures in general, for which Jewish experiences provide an important perspective.Rachel RojanskiAssociate Professor of Judaic Studies and HistoryUndergraduate Concentration AdvisorRachel_Rojanski@brown.eduRuth Adler Ben-YehudaSenior Lecturer in Judaic Studies Undergraduate Concentration Advisor Ruth_Adler_Ben_Yehuda@brown.eduProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownRequired Coursework for concentrators declaring in Spring 2013 and beyondThe Program in Judaic Studies offers two paths (detailed below). Please note that the following apply to each concentrator:1) All students are required to take a total of ten courses.2) All students must take one full year of Hebrew (two of the ten  required courses). Generally, this requirement will consist of two  courses in Elementary Hebrew (JS 0100/0200) or the equivalent as  determined by a proficiency examination. Fulfillment of the Hebrew  requirement through examination does not reduce the requirement to take  ten courses for the concentration.3) Upon declaring a concentration in Judaic studies,  each student must define his or her primary disciplinary track (History,  Religious Studies, or Language/Literature). Concentrators will then be  assigned a faculty mentor in that discipline (within the JS faculty) to  help the students select courses and construct a coherent concentration  plan. Program in History or Religious Studies:  For  this track, students are expected to complete a minimum of four courses  in their area of disciplinary focus (History or Religious Studies), at  least one of which must and no more than two of which may be outside the  program in Judaic Studies in the department of disciplinary focus  (preferably methods courses, such as in the History department or RELS  1000). Students in this track, in consultation with the concentration  adviser and faculty mentor, may apply up to two additional Hebrew  language courses (JUDS 0300, JUDS 0400, or JUDS 0500) to the additional  four required courses for the concentration.Program in Language/Literature:For  this track, students are expected to complete five courses in Hebrew  language (JUDS 0100/JUDS 0200; JUDS 0300/JUDS 0400; JUDS 0500). In  addition, students will take Issues in Israel in Hebrew (JUDS 0600) and  one further course in Judaic Studies (within the disciplinary focus).  Two additional courses in the disciplinary focus, at least one of which  must be outside the Program in Judaic Studies in a department of shared  disciplinary focus (e.g. English or Comparative Literature), are also  required. Fulfillment of the Hebrew requirement through proficiency  examination does not reduce the requirement to take ten courses for the  concentration. 4) Of the courses required in the Program in Judaic  Studies, at least one should focus on the ancient period and one should  focus on the modern period.5) Each student, in discussion with his/her mentor, is  required to designate an advanced course (1000 level) in his/her senior  year either within the Judaic Studies program or in the corresponding  disciplinary department as the capstone for his/her concentration.  Within the frame of this capstone course, the concentrator will write a  final paper on a topic in Judaic Studies that displays the in an  appropriate way the theoretical and interpretive issues of the  concentration focus. If students opt to fulfill this requirement in a  course outside the Program in Judaic Studies, the student must get  permission in advance both from his/her mentor and from the professor of  the course in question since the student’s final project will address a  Judaic studies topic or theme.6) Students who study at other institutions, either in  the United States or abroad, may apply a maximum of four courses (two  topical and two language courses) to the concentration.7) Double concentrators may count up to two courses  that they have used to complete their concentration requirements in  another department towards their concentraion in Judaic Studies.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWriting an Honors Thesis in Judaic Studies For thousands of years, Jews, their religion, their history, and their culture have been the subject of significant scholarly attention.  We encourage you to make your own contribution to this tradition by doing original research on some aspect of Judaic Studies and writing an honors thesis.To do this, you will need to be a concentrator in JS with an outstanding record (A- average) in JS courses and you will be expected to write a full academic paper of some 35,000-55,000 words based on your own original work.   As in all research, you will need to invest your time in planning, reading, thinking, and writing.   Before you embark on the project, discuss it with the Concentration Adviser, to make sure that it is the right choice for you.  Do this in your sixth semester.   With the help of the C.A. identify a faculty member who will work with you as you write your thesis.  Like everything else, research skills need to be learned, and your thesis director is there to help you learn them.Together with your director, you will think about a topic that really interests you and begin to hone it into a research project.  You will also choose a second reader for your paper, who, though less involved than your director, will help you by bringing you different perspectives – and different research skills.  By the end of the sixth semester, you should be set, with a topic, list of primary sources, basic bibliography, and plan of research and writing.  You will submit these for approval in a formal thesis proposal early in the seventh semester.Then it’s up to you!  Independent reading and research are what it is all about.  You will meet with your director on a regular basis to make sure that you are on track and to help you learn the tricks of our trade (what we call, critical research methodology and a logical research strategy).  Once you are ready to write, your director will help you plan your thesis and work with you on each chapter in turn.  All told, research and writing will take you two semesters.At the end of the process, you will have written a genuine piece of scholarship.   Based on original research and the close reading of primary sources, your thesis will present an argument based on your own analysis and will engage an ongoing debate or discussion in the field you have chosen.  You will be able to demonstrate your knowledge of the major research done in that field until now and identify your own contribution.  Clearly and precisely written, the final thesis should also have a complete scientific apparatus – citations and a full bibliography – and so can take its place in the research library of the field.Once it has been accepted and graded by your director and the second reader, your thesis will be discussed by the faculty members of the Judaic Studies Program as they vote on granting you Honors.  It will then be published on the Program’s website and made available to a wide audience of scholars and interested readers.   On Degree Day, you will be a member of a select group of students awarded BA with Honors.  Congratulations!TimetableFor further details, consult the detailed description of the JS Honors Program in the section on the Judaic Studies concentration in the University Bulletin:   http://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/juds/Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
