          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownJanine Sawada, Director of Graduate StudiesThe graduate program in Religious Studies at Brown is one of the finest in the nation. From among a large pool of highly qualified applicants, the department admits four to six doctoral students a year. Our students receive five years of full funding; additional funding is possible but not guaranteed. The department's graduates have an excellent placement record, teaching in such institutions as Harvard, Stanford, Indiana University, University of California, Brooklyn College, Reed College, Haverford, and University of Wisconsin (Madison). Current graduate students have distinguished themselves by presenting papers at international conferences and earning recognition and support from prestigious external funding organizations.We offer Ph.D. studies in four areas: For more information on these programs, please click on the program link above.In all programs, our goal is to combine specialized, rigorous training with a common and more general disciplinary approach to the study of religion.  We do not offer a general Masters program, although under exceptional circumstances we will consider applications for a specialized MA program in one of the three designated areas.  Doctoral students are normally expected to complete two years of coursework beyond their Masters degree (or three years post-baccalaureate).  These courses are primarily drawn from seminars offered by departmental faculty, but also include individual reading courses as well as courses in other departments, such as Classics, Philosophy, History, Comparative Literature, Anthropology, Political Science, and the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World.  The third year is spent preparing for and taking Preliminary Exams, and the remaining years are devoted to developing the dissertation prospectus and researching and writing the dissertation.  Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownEach Ph.D. area has its own core faculty.  For 2017-2018, the core faculty members areAsian Religious Traditions (ART): Jason Protass, Harold Roth, Janine Sawada; also James Fitzgerald (Classics)Islam, Society and Culture (ISC): Shahzad Bashir, Nancy KhalekReligion and Critical Thought (RCT): Stephen Bush, Mark Cladis, Thomas A. Lewis, Paul Nahme, Andre WillisReligions of the Ancient Mediterranean (RAM): Susan Harvey, Nancy Khalek, Ross Kraemer (Emerita), Saul Olyan, Michael Satlow, Stanley Stowers (Emeritus)For the years prior to advancing to candidacy, the advising structure varies among the three areas.  In ART and RCT, students are individually assigned an advisor upone entering the program but are strongly encouraged to consult with other core faculty as well.  ART and RCT also have area advisors who are responsible for checking up on all of the area students and advising them regarding requirements.  RAM has two area advisors, one for students focusing on the religions of ancient West Asia, and the other for students focusing on the religions of the Greco-Roman or early Islamic Mediterranean.  The area advisor generally serves as the student's primary advisor through the Preliminary Examinations phase, except in RAM, where entering students are generally assigned an advisory committee upon matriculation. Graduate students, however, are expected to take primary responsibility for their schedules.  This means that while students must carefully consult with the members of the core faculty in their area, the faculty expect students to develop and be able to justify their own schedule.  Typically, students still taking courses should develop a preliminary schedule and discuss it with other core faculty as well as the advisor.Although students may begin formulating a dissertation topic at any time during their course work, during the early stages of the examination process students should be actively thinking about the formal dissertation proposal and the best person to advise the dissertation.Once a student has advanced to candidacy, the dissertation advisor serves as the student's primary advisor through completion.  Most graduate students continue to consult with other faculty in their area for advice about various aspects of their professional program.   Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department of Religious Studies expects that all Ph.D. students will make satisfactory and timely progress through the graduate program, and all funding is contngent on such progress.  Students whose work is ultimately deemed insufficient by the faculty may be terminated from the program, although such a determination is unusual and only reached after considerable consultation.  In some cases, students terminated from Ph.D. study may be eligible to receive a terminal M.A. Students whose work is otherwise acceptable but whose progress is not sufficiently timely may have their funding withdrawn, or may be terminated from the program.Graduate students are evaluated annually in writing: first year students are also evaluated at the end of their first semester in residence.  Currently, different areas use somewhat different evaluation processes.  In all cases, however, at the end of each academic year, each area's faculty discuss the progress of each student and then write a formal evaluation summarizing these discussions.  This evaluation indicates wheter the student is in Good standing, Satisfactory standing, or on Warning.  The parameter for each status are set forth in the Graduate Handbook, available on the Graduate School website.  They are intended to provide a formal mechanism that conveys the expectations of the faculty for the coming year.   Should a student fall behind or in another way not fulfill the faculty's expectations, the letter will specify precisely what the student needs to do, and in what time-frame, to maintain a status of "satisfactory progress" in the program.  Students are encouraged to discuss any issues raised in these evaluations with the appropriate faculty, and if necessary, wht the DGS as well.The evaluation is normally sent to the studnet by e-mail and hard copy (departmental mailboxes unless otherwise requested).  Hard copies are kept in the student's departmenal file.  The letters of evaluation are not routinely shared outside the department, although it may occasionally be necessary to share them with the Graduate School administration.  However, the student's standing is reported to the Graduate School each year (and at mid-year for first year students).  Please also note that the progress standings differ from those which appear on the student's transcript issued by the Registrar.  Good Standing with the Registrar means only that the student has successfully completed a minimum number of courses: a student whose progress is Satisfactory, or even Warning may still be in Good Standing with the Registrar.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownTeaching assistantships are an essential part of the graduate education.  In addition to providing graduate students with the opportunity to cultivate their skills as classroom instructors, assistantships also provide students opportunities to receive guidance and mentorship from a faculty member.Introductions Once teaching assistants have been assigned to a course, teaching assistants and instructors are encouraged to introduce themselves to each other.  TAs will likely describe their teaching experience and research interests.  Instructors may also wish to describe their teaching and research interests, or share the current draft of the course syllabus and invite the assistant(s), when appropriate, to offer feedback.  Instructors generally stive to help their TAs understand  the intellectual and pedagogical thinking behind the course and its design; by helping TAs achieve such an understanding, instructors can enable TAs to participate in the unfolding of a course more fully.  This first meeting plays a vital role in educating graduate students about course design as well as in determining if and how the course may relate to the student's own area of expertise.  Since the latter point profoundly shapes the TAs experience, it should be kept in mind througout the planning and conduct of the course. Course Design After sharing the syllabus (or discussing the course) with teaching assistants, instructors may wish to invite TAs to offer any constructive comments, questions, or suggestions regarding course design or requirements.  When appropriate to the student's expertise, instructors ordinarily provide TAS with the opportunity to lecture or lead class during periods of the course that they find most interesting or relevant to their own studies.  This will typically involve one or two class sessions per semester.Pedagogical aspirations and expectations If the course to which a TA is assigned falls outside of his or her subfield, the TA is encouraged to consider how that factor might influence her or his approach to the teaching assignment.  This is especially relevant for those occassions in which a TA from outside the department is working with an RS instructor, or when an RS student is acting as a TA outside the department; both scenarios may require additional communication with instructors about how best to work with these guidelines in mind.  In general, as future faculty members, TAs likely will be tasked with teaching a course outside their areas of specialization.  As a result, TAs should see teaching assignments outside their paritcular subfield (whether in RS or not) as an opportunity to stretch both intellectually and pedagogically.  Recognizing that TAs own interests and experiencs will orient their understanding of and approach to the course, instructors are encouraged to be in dialogue with TAs about how to approach their teaching assignment.Pedagogical aspirations and expectationsIdeally, the faculty member and TA(s) will meet in person at least once prior to the beginning of the semester.  Topics for discussion might include: Logisitical SupportAt the beginning of the course, teaching assistants may offer instructors assistance with logistical issues relating to the course.  These include but are not limited to: making sure books have arrived at the bookstore; updating the course's Canvas page; ensuring that readings will be uploaded to OCRA.  In general, it is desirable to avoid making last-minute or unreasonably time-sensitive requests.Discussion SectionsEarly in the semester, as enrollments stabilize, is when teaching assistants and instructors usually discuss any issues relating to potential discussion sections.  These issues might include assigning students to sections, for example, or deciding which sections the teaching assistants or instructor will lead.  Teaching assistants, generally, should lead no more than two discussion sections.It is also important to discuss the purpose and goals of discussion sections.  For instance, possible aims may include reviewing material covered in lectures, introducing supplementary new material to the students, having the students work independently on the material, or some combination of these.  Some discussion may be devoted to outlining the role fauclty and TAs each have in determining what takes place in the sections.Particularly in cases where students are teaching out of their principal area of expertise, it is often helpful for the faculty member to provide specific suggestions for discussion topics for the first couple of section meetings.TAs are also strongly encouraged to have some form of mid-semester evaluation of the discussion sections.  The Sheridan Center has many relevant resources for this process.Teaching ObservationRecognizing that classroom teaching and student grading are skills that improve with practice and constructive guidance, instructors amy arrange to provide TAs with feedback regarding their teaching and grading.  In addition to observing any lectures that TAs deliver (note: if an instuctor must be absent for a TA's lecture, the instructor may consider having the lecture video recorded), instuctors ordinarily attend at least one meeting of each TA's discussion section.  Observing teaching is a complex activity, and faculty are urged to consult appropriate resources prior to observing the TA.  Valuable resources can be found at http://1.umn.edu/obr/teachlearn/resources/peer/guidelines/index.htmland http:www.albany.edu/teachingandlearning/tlr/peer_obs/index.shtmlIt may also be helpful to implement some or all of the following guidelines in preparation for the observation of TA teaching sessions:Drafting assignments and examsIf appropriate, and at the instructor's discretion, TAs may be integrally involved in drafting paper prompts, exams, and any other assignments.  The experience could serve as an important part of their training as instructors, and TAs often have a strong sense of the undergraduate students based on their performance in discussion sections.Feedback on gradingAs students turn in their assignments, instructors should strive to communicate clearly with their TAs regarding grading rubrics and standards, and may also periodically review samples of work that TAs have graded.  Students particularly value the opportunity to talk with faculty about expectations for comments and about grading standards.  By reviewing TA grading, instructors can assess their TAs' teaching more comprehensively and can ensure equitable grading of all enrolled students.  Having faculty review even 5-6 papers with comments and tentative grades (across the grading scale) can be very effective. Teaching assessmentInstructors are generally encouraged to solicit student assessment of the course during the semester; when soliciting such assessment, instructors should make sure to provide students with an opportunity to assess their discussion sections and TA performance.  Instructors may also consider sharing and discussing student feedback with the TAs.Regular meetingsTAs and instructors may meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the course material, the progress of the course, topics with which students are having difficulty, and any other issues or concerns that arise.  It is helpful to schedule periodic face to face check-ins, rather than rely exlusively on brief converesations on the way in and out of class.  Ideally, TAs should expect to meet with the faculty member several times over the course of the semester.  During these meetings, instructors may invite TAs to offer their feedback on the progress of the course.  This also aids faculty as they generally maintain and awareness of how much time the TA is spending on the course and make sure that it is not interfering with the TA's other required work. Collaborative evaluationAfter the course, instructors and TAs are encouraged to meet to discuss how the course went.  This conversation not only will help instructors improve the course in subsequent offerings but also will allow TAs to continue thinking about course design and implementation.  Following this meeting, instructors are encouraged to record reflections about their TAs' performance in the course; these records will prove useful in the future, should the student ever ask for a letter of teaching recommendation.  These records also will be useful when feedback on teaching is solicited as part of the annual review process.What to keep and who should keep itTypically, any originals of student material that are not returned to the student (such as final exams) should be turned over to the faculty member and kept by the faculty member for one year.  TAs should also provide faculty members with copies of gradesheets and similar records.  In cases where electronic versions exist, it may make the most sense for both parties to retain copies in case of future student questions. As with all student records, these should be stored securely. In addition, TAs should consider retaining samples of student work with the TA's feedback as well as any course material they have produced to include in a teaching dossier.  TAs should consult both faculty and the Sheridan Center for suggestions on the teaching dossier.  Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownApplications are welcomed from students with a baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degree. Though most candidates admitted to the program have some M.A. level experience, exceptionally promising candidates may be admitted directly from the B.A.Prior to applying, students are encouraged to contact faculty with whom they are interested in working, and if possible, to visit during the academic year. Such prior contact allows students to gain a better sense of our programs than any materials can convey. For logistical help in arranging such a visit, please contact Nicole Vadnais (Nicole_Vadnais@brown.edu). We regret that we cannot provide any financial assistance for such visits. All applications are given the same consideration regardless of whether the applicant has contacted us in advance and/or visited Brown.Asian Religious Traditions (ART) and Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean (RAM) programs expect some proper preparation in relevant languages.  Applicants to ART: East Asian Studies (EAS) must have at least two years of Chinese or Japanese; three or more years is highly recommended. Applicants to ART: South Asian Traditions (SAT) should have at least two years of either Sanskrit or Hindi-Urdu. Students intending to specialize in some aspect of Ancient Judaism must have a minimum of two years of college level biblical Hebrew or its equivalent; a working knowledge of modern and rabbinic Hebrew and introductory ancient Greek are also highly desirable. Students intending to specialize in some aspect of early Christianity, or Greek or Roman religion should have college level training in at least one of the principal ancient languages for the program, Greek or Latin. Preference will be given to RAM applicants who have appropriate prior study of Greek (and other appropriate languages) and a reading knowledge of French or German, as well as prior work in the history, literature, and religions of the ancient Mediterranean.Excellent command of English, both spoken and written, is also required of all successful applicants. Please note that there is no minimum GRE score or GPA. While applicants are expected to have demonstrated excellent preparation, aptitude, and potential to be successful scholars and teachers, we carefully consider the complete application. We pay particularly close attention to the personal statement, so applicants should take care in articulating why they think that our department is an appropriate place for them to study.A writing sample is not required as part of the application. Applicants who wish to submit one should limit the sample to approximately 6000 words (about 25 ordinary typed pages).The application deadline for the next academic year is January 5. Applicants should apply online through the university Graduate School. Read these pages (particularly the "General Information" section) carefully before applying.Brown University admits students without regard to national or ethnic origin, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, and creed of handicap. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownIn any given year, the Department of Religious Studies at Brown receives 80 to 100 or so applications for Ph.D. study. Of these, fewer than 10% will be offered admission. The advice we offer here is intended to help you think realistically about whether to apply for Ph.D. work in general, and whether to apply specifically to the Religious Studies Department at Brown.Some General Things:Doing a Ph.D. is a major commitment of time and resources. Obtaining a Ph.D. at Brown in Religious Studies normally takes at least five years, and frequently more, even for students who come with a master's degree in a related area. It's a long haul, even with the five years of full-funding offered to all accepted applicants (which includes tuition, a stipend for living expenses, health care and health insurance, and modest support for a few professional expenses like research and conference travel).The workload of doctoral study will probably far exceed anything you have previously encountered, from extensive weekly reading (and often rigorous language courses), to the research and writing time necessary to produce multiple lengthy research papers each semester (25 pp.+ each). So-called “vacation breaks” are generally used for more work; and many students feel considerable pressure. At the same time, of course, for students who love the field they're studying, it can also be a source of much intellectual excitement, satisfaction and pleasure.So are you sure, this is what you want?What alternatives have you considered? Have you thought about what you will do if you are not accepted for Ph.D. study at a program appropriate for your interests? Are there other professional possibilities that might appeal to you equally?Do you have a well-informed understanding of what academic life is like, and what the academic job market is like? For instance, do you know how much college professors make? Current starting salaries for assistant professors in liberal arts environments are are as low as the mid-$50Ks a year, although some research universities pay as much as $75,000 a year, usually plus health benefits, retirement contributions, and varying amounts of research support (including use of a computer). Compared to a graduate stipend of about $20,000, this may sound like a lot, but compared to salaries in many fields requiring comparable (or sometimes even less) preparation, like medicine, law, business, engineering, it's not. Some offer more generous benefits, including subsidized child-care, assistance with college tuition, and so forth: others offer substantially less.We have an excellent placement record: our former Ph.D. students are teaching at the University of Wisconsin (Madison), Emory University, Marquettte University, Holy Cross, as well as Haverford, Oberlin, Brooklyn and Colorado Colleges. Still, the academic market is highly competitive. Every year there are far more applicants for entry-level teaching positions in Religious Studies than there are positions. Many of these positions are in large public universities and colleges with heavy teaching loads and little support for research. Others are in small colleges, or small departments. where faculty are routinely expected to teach broad undergraduate courses, and have little opportunity to teach the research specialties they acquired in graduate school.Assuming that you've satisfied yourself that you want a Ph.D., is the Department of Religious Studies at Brown a good place to do the work in which you are interested?Do you have a clear understanding of what the academic study of religion entails, as opposed to the practice of religion?Are your interests centrally located in academic work in religious studies, including explanatatory accounts of religion? Have you read work in the study and theory of religion? Are you familiar with some of the classic theories of religion (e.g. Durkheim, Eliade, Freud, Hume, James, Weber) as well as more recent theorists (e.g. Asad, Bell, Bourdieu, Boyer, Douglas, Horton, Mahmood, McCutcheon, Pyysaïnen, J.Z. Smith)? While we don't require applicants to have studied these theorists previously, all students take a required seminar that considers theory of religion at a professional level. Applicants who have read some of this work often have a better understanding of the academic study of religion.Do you have appropriate preparation for Ph.D. work?  While we do occasionally accept students who have only a B.A. degree, we only do so when those students have majored in Religious Studies, or in a closely related field (such as classics, or philosophy, or Asian studies), or have done considerable coursework in Religious Studies, and have studied some of the languages they will need in graduate work. Students who lack such preparation should first do a master's program, or a post-baccalaureate language program elsewhere, since Brown does not offer such study.Do you have a good sense of why Religious Studies at Brown is a good fit for your interests?Admission is based not simply on the academic potential of the applicant but also on the match between the applicant's interests and the areas of expertise of Department faculty.  Every year, we receive applications from prospective students who do not demonstrate much awareness of the areas of expertise of our faculty, and whose own interests would not be well-served at Brown.  All applicants should read our website carefully, and take time to learn something about the specific research and teaching interest of our faculty, available on our research profiles.  Don't just crib a line or two off our website and insert it into a generic application statement.  Show us how our interests and yours intersect.  Applicants who have read at least some of our work should have a better sense of whether and why Brown might be a good fit.  (This will obviously be true for applications you make elsewhere as well).  Graduate applicants often ask what we look for in prospective students, and whether there are any minum requirements for GRE scores, undergraduate and Masters GPA, etc.  We look for evidence that applicants have the intellectual capacity to do excellent scholarly work, as well as the requisite preliminary training, skills and personal traits to complete a Ph.D. program in a timely manner, and go on to a productive professional academic life. We also look for evidence that students are appropriately prepared to work in their particular areas of interest, including sufficient preliminary language training. To gauge your qualifications and preparation, we pay particular attention to your recommendations, and your personal statement. We also give considerable weight to your prior academic work, and to GRE scores, particularly the verbal and analytical scores.Students who take the GRE's numerous times should be aware that we usually receive all GRE scores, not just the highest scores. While most students admitted to our Ph.D. program tend to have very strong verbal and analytical GRE scores (650 or higher; 5.0 or higher) we have no absolute minimums for either GRE scores or GPAs, and we consider each applicant's file on its total merits. Applicants who are otherwise well-prepared and well-qualified for doctoral study, but whose GRE scores are below these levels are still given the most careful consideration. Last but not least, some advice on the application itself:Ask for recommendations from current and former teachers who know your work well, and, if at all possible, who work in fields close to those you wish to study, and can comment knowledgably about your preparations in these areas.  More general recommendations, or recommendations from scholars in other areas are of less help to us in assessing your scholarly potential.Put considerable effort into your personal statement. This is where you demonstrate to us that you are well-prepared to undertake doctoral work; that you know enough about the areas you wish to study, and about our work; that our interests and yours mesh well; that you write well and think clearly; and that you have the capacity to do innovative and imaginative academic work.  This is your chance to shine: use it wisely.Think seriously about coming to visit before you apply.  Such visits are not required, and we regularly accept students who have not visited, but such visits are often helpful to prospective students, as well as to us, in clarifying whether Brown is a strong fit.  You should give this especially serious consideration if your currently live relatively close to Providence, or will have some other occassion to be in the area.  Fall (before Thanksgiving) and spring, are esepcially good times to visit: classes are in session and faculty and current graduate students are usually available to meet with you.  If you can't visit, still be in touch with faculty.  Even more important than a visit to campus is some form of contact with faculty.  Email exchanges and in some cases phone calls can ve very useful in determining whether the Department of Religious Studies at Brown is a good fit for someone with your interests.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownRegardless of the specific focus, all Ph.D. work in Religious Studies at Brown has the same general five part structure: 1. Residence (coursework); 2. Satisfaction of Qualifying Requirements (languages, subject-specific competences, theory and method); 3.  Teaching Preparation; 4. Preliminary Examinations; 5. Disseration (Prospectus and defense, actual dissertation; final public oral examination).RESIDENCE (COURSEWORK)All students are required to complete the equivalent of three years (six semesters) of full-time study beyond the baccalaureate degree (i.e. twenty-four tuition units). Up to one full year of graduate work done in residence at other institutions and not used in fulfillment of the requirements for the Ph.D. elsewhere may, on the recommendation of the department faculty (normally the DGS)  and with the approval of the registrar, be counted in fulfillment of this requirement.  We encourage students to work and develop professional relationships with faculty outside of the Department who focus in cognate areas.  Students who have completed their formal coursework often continue to attend doctoral seminars until they have passed their preliminary examinations and begun work on the dissertation.QUALIFYING REQUIREMENTSAll graduate students should consult with their area advisor (and other faculty as appropriate) to determine the qualifying requirements for their particular program, which differ depending on the specific area of study.  These qualifying requirements ordinarily include language training as well as basic knowledge of, and competence in, the history and culture of particular traditions.  In addition, all RS grad students must demonstrate competence in theory and method in Religious Studies, ordinarily through successful completion of RELS 2000.TEACHING TRAINING All RS graduate students are expected to serve as Teaching Assistants for courses in their areas of specialization.  In addition, most students will be asked to serve as TAs in other departmental courses as our staffing needs require, or even in courses outside the department, as the University's needs require.  All RS graduate students are heavily encouraged to participate in the teaching training programs run by the Sheridan Center, including their Certification programs.PRELIMINARY (DOCTORAL) EXAMINATIONSOrdinarily, all Ph.D. students sit for the Preliminary Examination in at least three areas, a major area, a minor area, and the area of dissertation specialization.  Although the precise forms of these examinations are at the discretion of the area faculty and may vary depending on the specifics of the student's program, each area has designed its exams to help students acquire specialized expertise as well as disciplinary breadth.  All students should work out the format and general content of these examinations with their area advisor (and other faculty) early in their graduate programs: all areas require students to be involved actively in developing their own reading lists.  At the discretion of the area faculty, students may be required to revise portions of their exams or given an opportunity to rewrite or retake an exam.  If, in the end, the area faculty determines that the student has not passed the Preliminary Exams, the student will be asked to leave the program and the area faculty will decide wheter the student will be awarded a terminal M.A., contingent on the quality of the student's course work and examinations.DISSERTATIONThe dissertation requirement includes the following: the formulation of an acceptable dissertation topic; the preparation of a formal prospectus; a closed oral prospectus defense; the formation of a dissertation committee; the submission and acceptance of the actual dissertation; a final public oral examination.Dissertations regularly set one's scholarly program for years to come and contribute substantially to one's professional identity, including one's perceived suitability for various teaching positions.  Students should be thinking about possible dissertation topics from the beginning of their program, and should disccuss these aspects of prospective thesis topics early on with their advisors.  Topics or areas for dissertation research often develop out of work in seminars and courses, so students should choose course papers with an eye to their suitability for further research.  Once a student has identified a topic or promising area, the natural choice for first reader or advisor will be the faculty member whose specializations most closely match that topic.  The student should work with this person (and the other faculty members in the program) to develop a prospectus and to choose  second and third readers for the dissertation.  Students ordinarily devote at least two years to the dissertation, including research and writing, although occassionally less.DISSERTATION PROSPECTUSWritten ProspectusStudents who have successfully passed their examinations must then present a dissertation prospectus to the Religious Studies faculty for their discussion and approval.  The prospectus should present the proposed dissertation topic, explain its scholarly context and justification, describe the methodologies to be employed, put forth a plan for procedure (e.g., a tentative, annotated table of contents) and a select bibliography.  The ideal typical length of the prospectus is ten to twenty pages, including a bibliography.The student works closely with his or her advisor on the prospectus.  Before a prospectus meeting can be scheduled, the student should circulate a draft of the prospectus to all probable members of the dissertation committee, sufficiently far in advance to allow the committee members time to comment on the draft, and to allow the student to make any necessary revisions.  The student should also determine, in advance, the availability of committee members to respond to such drafts.Graduate students should allow at least four weeks for this part of the process, if not longer, depending on the state of the initial draft and the availability of the committee members.When the committee members have had an opportunity to comment on the draft, and when the proposed dissertation director is satisfied that the prospectus is ready, the meeting may be scheduled.  Once the dissertation director notifies the DGS that the prospectus is ready, prospectus meetings will be scheduled thought the Department Administrator, who will use a scheduling survey to identify a feasible time for the meeting.  The DGS then approves the meeting time, announces the meeting to the department faculty, and any appropriate outside faculty, and circulates the prospectus electronically.  The faculty should be given notice of the meeting, and be sent the approved draft of the prospectus, no less than two weeks in advance.  To facilitate this, the DGS should receive the approved prospectus no less than 17 days before the proposed meeting date, and ideally 21 days in advance of the proposed meeting. Prospectus PresentationThe prospectus presentation ordinarily takes place 2-4 weeks after submission of the prospectus.  Unlike the final oral defense of the dissertation, this is a closed meeting (ordinarily about 90 minutes), where the RS faculty (and invited faculty guests) and the student discuss the proposed dissertation.  This is a working session whose purpose is for the faculty to have constructive input early enought to avoid major problems later and to assist in clarifying the dissertation process.Ordinarily, the DGS presides.  After any appropriate preliminary consultation of the faculty, the student begins with a brief statement (10 minutes), describing the genesis of the project and how it relates to the work the student has done in the department.  After appropriate faculty questioning and discussion, the student leaves the room briefly while faculty assess the dissertation, raise any further issues, and clarify agreements about the dissertation committee.  The student then returns and is informed of the faculty's decision regarding both the prospectus and the committee, and given any further points of clarification, advice, or procedure.  Occasionally, the faculty may ask for revisions or clarifications prior to official approval of the prospectus.  When the faculty apprroves the prospectus, the student is formally advanced to candidacy. DISSERTATION COMMITTEE & ADVISINGThe student's dissertation committee will be determined upon consultation between the student and faculty.  The committee should be informally arranged prior to the prospectus meeting, with the help of the student's advisor and the DGS.  The committee is officially constituted at the conference on the dissertation prospectus.  Ultimately, the authority for appointing the dissertation director and the members of the dissertation committee rests with the faculty of the Department.The dissertation committee consists of an advisor and at least two other members.  Depending on the dissertation it may be advisable to have a fourth member on the committee (In exceptional circumstances, a fifth member is possible; but this is unusual and needs to be justified by the specific circumstances).  When deemed appropriate, it is possible to have scholars from outside the department to serve on the committee.Different institutions (and departments) have different procedures for dissertation advising.  In Religious Studies, it is often the case that only the advisor reads first drafts, and that second and third (and fourth, if applicable) readers only see and critique the project at a later stage.  These practices, however, are flexible, and students are encouraged to devise a process with their advisors that provides the most constructive guidance to the student, and produces the strongest possible result.  Students should keep in mind, though, that reading and critiquing dissertations is highly time-consuming for faculty.  Being mindful of faculty schedules and workload makes it more likely that students will receive productive feedback and complete their dissertation in a timely manner.  Students should always let faculty members know well in advance when to expect drafts, and should have reasonable expectations about faculty turn-around time.  DISSERTATION DEFENSE/ORAL EXAMINATIONThe Department of Religious Studies requires that the dissertation, demonstrating original research and advanced scholarship, be defended in an oral examination before the faculty.  This occasion brings the student together with the readers and other pertinent faculty and is usually open to the larger university community, including graduate students.It is the responsibility of the dissertation advisor to determine, in consultation with the full dissertation committee, that a dissertation is acceptable and ready for defense.  All committee members must thus have read the final version of the dissertation sufficiently to participate in this determination.  When the advisor, having consulted with the whole committee, judges that a dissertation is ready for defense, she or he will, in consultation with the DGS, schedule a date, time and place for the defense.  Defense are not ordinarily scheduled during Winter Break, when the University is not in session, nor during the summer months of July, and August, and June defenses are unusual.  Notice of the defense must be provided to the full faculty no less than two weeks prior to the defense.  An electronic copy of the dissertation and an abstract must also be circulated to the faculty no less than two weeks prior to the defense.The format of the defense, which is technically an oral examination, is similar to that of the prospectus meeting.  University procedures expect that the dissertation director will reside, but the DGS may also do so, often in concert with the dissertation director.  Normally, the faculty hold a brief closed meeting (without the candidate or any guests) to discuss the format of the defense, and to consider any last minute issues that may have arisen.  The candidate and any other guests attending then join the faculty.  After the candidate provides an overview of the dissertation, faculty ask critical questions, normally for about an hour and a half.  The faculty then meet in closed session to evaluate the student's work.  Faculty may ask for additional revisions prior to formally accepting the dissertation.  When the faculty formally accept the dissertation, including approval of the defense, the student has successfully completed the doctoral degree.DEPOSIT of the DISSERTATIONDetailed instructions for the preparation and subission of the dissertation and abstract, as well as information on filing fees, microfilm publication and copyright, are available on the Graduate School website.  Students should familiarize themselves with these requirements very early on in the writing process.  Students must allow a minimum of several days beyond the defense before formal submission, in order to incorporate any final changes or corrections from the defense before binding: several weeks are preferable.DISSERTATION DEADLINESThe Graduate School exepcts that all candidates will successfully submit and defend the dissertation within five years of achieving candidacy.  Students who have not done so may petition the Graduate School for a one-year extension, in the form of an explanatory letter, with the consent of the DGS.  A second one-year extension is also possible but requires action by the Graduate Council.  Such requests are not automatically granted, and students should make every possible effort to meet this deadline.RECEIVING THE ACTUAL DEGREEPh.D. degrees are awarded only at Spring commencement, regardless of when the actual defense takes place.  To receive a Ph.D. degree at commencement, students must submit the dissertation by the first business day in May, although an extension to May 15 is possible when a request is submitted to the Graduate School.  Students who anticipate completing the dissertation within one month of the semester following that in which they are presently registered may request a one month extension that allows them to complete their work without registering (and paying) for the following semester.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownART offers training in the study of Asian religions in their historical andcultural contexts.  Students are expected to choose their tradition or region of specialization from among the fields of expertise of the Brown faculty, currently in the following areas:EAST ASIAN RELIGIONS (EAR)SOUTH ASIAN RELIGIONS (SAR)EAST ASIAN RELIGIONS (EAR)DescriptionStudents of East Asian Religions specialize in the religious traditions of either China or Japan, but attain broad competence in the religious history of the alternate area as well.  Students may also choose to concentrate on a specific religious tradition (Daoist, Confucian, or Buddhist) as it developed in the East Asian historical context.  Those who specialize in the Daoist tradition study its origins and development in the intellectual context of early China and selected later developments.  Students who concentrate on the Confucian tradition study its emergence and development in the intellectual context of early China, as well as the major Neo-Confucian interpretations of China, Korean, and/or Japan.  The study of Buddhism at Brown currently focuses on Song Chinese Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism from the Tokugawa through the Meiji periods.  Regardless of their area of concentration, all EAR students are expected to develop an understanding of the key issues involved in the historical interaction of the religious traditions of East Asia.ADMISSIONSuccessful applicants to the doctoral program in East Asian Religions ordinarily possess an M.A. or the equivalent in a related field of study.  At least two years of either Chinese or Japanese is required; three or more years is highly recommended.  Excellent command of English, both spoken and written is essential.COURSEWORKCourses are selected in consultation ith the student's primary advisor, usually in a meeting at the beginning of each semester.  EAR students are expected to complete at least six graduate seminars or the equivalent; at least four of the seminars will be in the main area of concentration (China or Japan), and at least two in the secondary area.  With the approval of the area faculty, a Brown University undergraduate course numbered above 1000 may count toward the seminar requirement if the student submits a successful graduate-level paper for the course.Students should draw on resources at Brown University not only in Religious Studies, but also in East Asian Studies, History, History of Art and Architecture, Comparative Literature, and/or the social sciences, as appropriate. Students may also cross-register for specialized courses at Harvard University, as time permits, and subject to the approval of the ART advisor and the Harvard instructor. Before their first preliminary examination EAR students should also complete the following specific courses: RELS 2000 Theory of ReligionRELS 1190 Japanese Religious Traditions, or the equivalentA survey course in Chinese religions.RELS 2300C Chinese Bibliography and Reference Resources or a course in Japanese bibliography (in accordance with the area of speciaization).A course in the history of China, Japan, or Korea (number above 1000).A course in the literature or art history of China, Japan, or Korea (numbered above 1000). For current courses related to East Asia at Brown see "East Asia Related courses"  posted annually by the Department of East Asian Studies. LANGUAGESEAR students must attain reading competence in at least one modern European language other than English (ordinarily French): in consultation with their advisory committee, they may count one East Asian language for the departmental second modern language requirement.  Native speakers of an East Asian language will be asked to demonstrate mastery of a second modern East Asian language and a modern European language other than English.Students of Chinese religions must demonstrate competence in modern Chinese, proficiency in classical Chinese, and reading competence in modern Japanese.  Students of Japanese religions must attain proficiency in modern Japanese and competence in classical Japanese; depending on their period of specialization, they should also learn how to read Sino-Japanese (kanbun). Entering students are advised take diagnosticc examinations in modern East Asian languages, which are administered at the beginning of each academic year by the Department of East Asian Studies.  Successful completion of the language requirements will be certified by one or more of the following methods, subject to the discretion of area faculty.Modern East Asian languages:(i) Completion of the following courses, or the equivalent, with a grade of B or better: China concentrators: CHIN 0800 and JAPN 0600 Japan concentrators: JAPN 0800 or JAPN 0910(ii) Successful performance in a diagnostic exam administered by Brown University faculty.Classical Chinese and kanbun: Successful performance in an examination administered by the area faculty. These exams will ordinarily consist of a two - three-hour translation examination in which lexical aids may be used.  In some cases, advanced (graduate level) coursework, with a grade of B or better, may satisfy this requirement, subject to faculty approval. Graduate students are urged to take intensive language courses at accredited language programs, whether in North America or East Asia, during the summer whenever possible, so as to complete their requirements in a timely fashion.  Applications to these programs and associated fellowships, as well as enquiries about Brown financial assistance for language study, should be made well in advance of the projected study period.PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONSThe first two doctoral examinations are based on bibliographies negotiated by the student and the advisory committee.  The final bibliography should be submitted to the committee for approval at the latest by the end of the semester preceding the one in which the exams are taken.The first exam covers the history of Chinese and Japanese religions as a whole; the second focuses on the student's special field.  These two exams will be scheduled on a separate day within a one-week period and should be completed before the beginning of the second semester aftr the completion of coursework (ordinarily by the end of the third year in residence).  These exams are written and are followed by an oral defense that takes place one week after they are completed.The third and final examination is a research paper written under the guidance of the members of the examination committee.  The topic of the paper is chosen in consultation with the student's main faculty advisor, who in most cases will chair the examination committee and become the dissertation supervisor.  The purpose of the paper is to certify that the student is qualified to carry out research in her or his special field.  The topic should accordingly be related to the student's projected thesis area and demonstrate substantial use of primary sources in the student's main research language as well as critical engagement with secondary sources.  Ordinarily the paper will take the form of an analysis or argument based on the student's research into a primary text ot texts, and/or other relevant study materials.  Optionally, an annotated translation of the main research text may be included in an appendix.DISSERTATION RESEARCHStudents of Japanese or Chinese religions are generally expected to conduct on-site research using original sources, whether primary texts in archives and libraries, works of art in museums, interviews with subjects, or other materials.  In many cases, primary texts must be located, read, and understood under the guidance of a Japanese or Chinese specialist in the field.  EAR graduate students should therefore plan to conduct research for an extended period, usually one year, in China or Japan after their dissertation prospectus has been approved.  Ordinarily they will apply for fellowships to conduct research abroad in the fall of the year preceding the academic year in which they plan to live in China or Japan. SOUTH ASIAN RELIGIONS (SAR)DESCRIPTIONThe study of South Asian Religions at Brown currently focuses on traditions of the ancient period.  Students should work closely with the area advisor, Professor James Fitzgerald (Department of Classics), to develop a program that will best suit their interests and prepare them for a career as a teacher and scholar of South Asian religions.ADMISSIONApplicants should have significant preparation in the academic study of South Asia and South Asian languages, ordinarily including two years of Sanskrit.COURSEWORKStudents normally take six semesters of course work and then spend two years in the research and writing of the Ph.D. dissertation.  Depending upon the needs of their particular program, students are encouraged to take courses in other Brown departments that bring them into contact with modern and contemporary contexts of South Asian religions and to seek out opportunities for periods of study and research in India in the course of their graduate careers.  LANGUAGESThe study of ancient South Asian religions requires passing a General Sanskrit reading exam and a Special Sanskrit reading exam, and attaining reading proficiency in both German and French.  Students in this area are also encouraged to study Hindi.PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONSThe preliminary examination has two parts. The first covers the general history, sources, and themes of the Hindu Religions of South Asia.  The second covers the broad area and themes within which the student's dissertation research will take place.Segement IThis segement is a Breadth Examination on the general history, sources, and themes of the Hindu Religions of South Asia.  It will consist of two three-hour written exams, one on Ancient India (from Vedic times to roughly 500CE) and one on the medieval period (500 CE to 1500).  This exam must be passed no later than the end of the sixth semester of residence.  The reading lists for these exams will be set by area faculty.Segement IIThis segmenet is a Special Area Examination over the broad area and themes within which the student's dissertation research will take place.  The focus, limits, and reading list for this examination will be designed through consultation between the student and his or her advisor.  This exam will be a single four hour written exam taken no later than the end of the sixth semester of residence.Core FacultyEast AsiaSouth AsiaAssociated FacultyEast AsiaSouth AsiaProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownRCT students in this program focus on issues, problems, and texts concerning: The program endeavors to integrate these areas, encouraging students to work at the intersection of normative and critical approaches, topics and disciplines.Given the program's emphasis on theory and critical thought, students are given broad exposure to classic and contemporary issues, problems, and texts associated with philosophy of religion, ethics, social-scientific theory, theology, and political philosophy.  At the same time, students are required to gain competence in at least one religious tradition in order to lend specificity to critical reflection on various aspects of religion and the study of religion.Core FacultyAffiliated FacultyIn addition to working with RCT core faculty, RCT graduate students often work closely with other faculty members both within and outside of the Department.  For example, a student may wish to link a RCT project with a Religious Studies faculty member doing historical work in Asian, Christian, Jewish, or Islamic traditions.  For faculty outside the Department who are closely affiliated with us, please see the list below.AdmissionCandidates are admitted to the program with a Master's Degree and also directly from their undergraduate programs.  Typically, students will have done previous work in the socio-critical and philosophical study of religion.CourseworkStudents with a masters degree in a relevant field will normally take two years of coursework; students entering with a bachelor’s degree will normally take three years.  During the coursework stage, students are expected to enroll in 4 courses each semester the first year, and three in subsequent years.  Students in their first three years of graduate studies are normally expected to participate in all RCT seminars.  Afther the third year, students should consult with the RCT advisor about whether they are expected to take a particular RCT seminar.  Generally speaking, students will draw on resources throughout the humanities and social sciences, for examplie, in the departments of Philosophy, Political Science, Comparative Literature, Africana Studies, Judaic Studies, Classics, Anthropology, and Sociology.  In consultation with the coure RCT faculty, students will develop a schedule that will satisfy the requirement for competence in a religious tradition through coursework.  Additionnally, students must demonstrate familiarity with a second religious tradition; this religious diversity requirement, depending on the judgement of the RCT faculty, may be satisfied by coursework done prior to attendance at Brown or by one or two additional courses at Brown.  Annual Meeting with FacultyThe student will meet annually with the RCT core faculty, normally toward the end of the spring semester.  This informal meeting is an opportunity to talk broadly about the student's trajectory in the program, that is, about one's past, preset, and future work.Language RequirementsAll students must pass examinations in French and German before taking their Preliminary Exams; subject to approval, French or German (but not both) may be replaced with an alternate.  Depending on their areas of interest, students may need to acquire additional language competence, for which there is no set examination structure.Preliminary ExaminationThe Preliminary Exams should be concluded within a year of completing the course work.  Normally, then, the Preliminary Exams would be concluded at the end of May of the student's third or fourth year (depending on whether the student entered the program with a bachelors or masters degree).  Three of the four Preliminary Exams may be satisfied by papers of not more than 10K words, including notes, or else (in the case of up to two of the three) by the more traditional format of a "take-home exam" on an extended reading list.  These three exams are defined as proficient treatment of:The fourth Preliminary Exam is a 10-page review essay of a noteworthy book pubished within the last 10 years or so.The topic and format of the four exams -- along with the order of their completion -- are proposed by the student to the RCT faculty and are subject to their approval.  This exam proposal (which covers all four exams) is normally submitted no later than the first week of classes in the fall semester of the year dedicated to the Exams.  Two exams must be completed by mid-January; students missing this deadline may not be considered for a dissertation fellowship for the following year.  Shortly after the conclusion of these exams, students will meet with the Advisory Faculty for a full discussion.   These meetings are an opportunity for intellectual exchange as well as an opportunity for the student to demonstrate competence in the fields of the exams (although passing of the exams is determined primarily by the quality of the student's written work).Following the completion of the exams, the dissertation prospectus should be defended in the early fall, preferably by the end of September.  For students who enter with a masters, this will be September of the fourth year; for students entering without a masters, this will be September of the fifth year.Recent DissertationsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownDescriptionRAM students focus on the interdisciplinary study of religion throughout the ancient Mediterranean and Near-East.  Choosing both a major and a related minor area, students examine ancient religions synchronically, understanding how they formed and functioned in their social, intellectual, and political contexts.  Students may choose as either a major or a minor field work inIn addition to these, students may choose as a minor field of only:AdmissionMost successful applicants to RAM come with an MA in a related field, although exceptionally promising BA students with significant undergraduate study in appropriate areas are also considered for admission.  Students are expected to have had some training in the academic study of religion.  Students intending to specialize in any aspect of ancient Israelite or Judean religion (Judaism) must have a minimum of two years of college level biblical Hebrew or its equivalent; a working knowledge of modern and rabbinic Hebrew and introductory ancient Greek are also highly desirable.  Students intending to specialize in some aspect of early Christianity or Greek or Roman religion should have college level training in Greek or Latin, and ideally both. Students intending to specialize in any aspect of early Islam should have prior study of classical Arabic. Preference will be given to RAM applicants who have appropriate prior study of the major language(s) of their proposed field, and a reading knowledge of French or German, as well as prior work in the history, literature, and religions of the ancient Mediterranean.  CourseworkDuring the first year, students, in consultation with the RAM advisor and other appropriate faculty, design a curriculum that allows for exploration while remaining appropriately focused.  RAM students specializing in the Greek-Roman Mediterranean are expected to take two pro-seminars, one in Greek and Roman philosophy and religion, and the other on sources and methods for the study of Judeans/Jews through the Roman period, which are taught in alternative years, ordinarily in the fall.  RELS 2000, which is taught every other year, should be taken as soon as possible.  At the end of the first year, students choose both a major and minor field.  This advisory committee may or may not be identical to the student's eventual dissertation committee.Students are expected to complete at least three seminars (or independent studies) in the major field and two in the minor field.  All coursework must be completed prior to being allowed to sit for the Preliminary Examination. Qualifying RequirementsThese depend upon the student's specific areas of interest but always include language training, RELS 2000, and appropriate preparation in the sources and methods of the areas of focus.  Students should discuss the expectations for their particular areas with the RAM program coordinator, their advising committee, and any other appropriate faculty, as soon as possible.LanguagesAncient LanguagesRequired ancient languages are determinded according to the student's field, in consultation with the student's advisory committee. All major fields require knowledge of Greek; some require proficiency.  Israelite religion and all periods of Judaism also require proficiency in ancient Hebrew, and knowledge of Aramaic; early Islam requires proficiency in Arabic.  Students studying Christianity are ordinarily expected to learn Latin and/or Coptic or Syriac.  Diagnostic examinations are ordinarily given to students entering in Greek, Latin, and other langugaes as appropriate, typically consisting of a thre-hour translation test in which lexical aids may be used.  Students ma be asked to retake one or more of these examinations annually until they have achieved an adequate level of competence, as determined by the faculty.  In some cases, advanced (graduate level) coursework, with a grade of B or better, may satisfy the requirement, at the discretion of the faculty.  All language requirements should be completed by the end of the student's second year (third if the student entered without an M.A.), and must be fulfilled prior to sitting for the Preliminary Examination. Modern Scholarly LanguagesIn addition to demonstrating competence in two modern languages, ordinarily French and German, those students who major or minor in some fields, particularly Judaism in any time period, must also demonstrate competency in modern scholarly Hebrew.  Depending on the student's area of interest, additional modern languages may be desirable or even required, such as Italian, Spanish,  and others.  Competency in these languages can be demonstrated in one of three ways:Preliminary ExaminationThe RAM Preliminary Examination is taken in three parts: Major Field, Minor Field; Ancillary area.  Ordinarily, students who entered with a MA in a relevant field will spend their third year of study preparing for and taking the Preliminary Examination.  Students who entered without an MA in a related field are expected to complet the Preliminary Examination during their fourth year of study.  Preparation for these examinations, including reading lists for the major and minor fields, will be made in consultation with the student's advisory committee.  The various parts of the examination may be taken in any order, although the ancillary part is normally the last.The major field examination is administered by the major field advisor, in consultation with the advisory committee.  Its purpose is to assess teaching and resarch competency, and to assure broad competency in the scholarly discussions and major debates in the major areas of the student's primary field.  The minor field examination is administered by the minor field advisor, also in consulation with the advisory committee.  The purpose of this exam is to assure teaching competency, as well as competency in the salient issues relevant to the dissertation area.  The ancillary exam is determined in consultation with the advisory committee and may, as appropriate, involve the participation of additional faculty.  The ancillary area may address varying types of primary source data (e.g. archaeological or documentary, in addition to textual material), or the use of varying methodologies (e.g., anthropology).  The format of each exam will be determined by consultation between the student and the advisory committee.  Possible formats may include, but are not limited to: a one-week take-home exam, with option of writing on one big question (approx. 20-15pp.) or a choice of more specific questions (for example, 5 out 7 questions, for essays of 5pp. each); a 24-hour take home exam; a four-hour sit-down exam, writing on 2 out of 4 questions; or two papers on propsed thematic topics (10 pages each). DissertationRAM students follow the usual departmental procedures for the preparation and submission of a dissertation prospectus, appointment of dissertation committee, research, writing, submission and defense of the dissertation.  For details, see the handbook.Core FacultySusan Ashbrook Harvey, Royce Family Professor of Teaching Excellence, Willard Prescott and Annie McClelland Smith Professor of Religious StudiesNancy S.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownRCT students in this program focus on issues, problems, and texts concerning: The program endeavors to integrate these areas, encouraging students to work at the intersection of normative and critical approaches, topics and disciplines.Given the program's emphasis on theory and critical thought, students are given broad exposure to classic and contemporary issues, problems, and texts associated with philosophy of religion, ethics, social-scientific theory, theology, and political philosophy.  At the same time, students are required to gain competence in at least one religious tradition in order to lend specificity to critical reflection on various aspects of religion and the study of religion.Core FacultyAffiliated FacultyIn addition to working with RCT core faculty, RCT graduate students often work closely with other faculty members both within and outside of the Department.  For example, a student may wish to link a RCT project with a Religious Studies faculty member doing historical work in Asian, Christian, Jewish, or Islamic traditions.  For faculty outside the Department who are closely affiliated with us, please see the list below.AdmissionCandidates are admitted to the program with a Master's Degree and also directly from their undergraduate programs.  Typically, students will have done previous work in the socio-critical and philosophical study of religion.CourseworkStudents with a masters degree in a relevant field will normally take two years of coursework; students entering with a bachelor’s degree will normally take three years.  During the coursework stage, students are expected to enroll in 4 courses each semester the first year, and three in subsequent years.  Students in their first three years of graduate studies are normally expected to participate in all RCT seminars.  Afther the third year, students should consult with the RCT advisor about whether they are expected to take a particular RCT seminar.  Generally speaking, students will draw on resources throughout the humanities and social sciences, for examplie, in the departments of Philosophy, Political Science, Comparative Literature, Africana Studies, Judaic Studies, Classics, Anthropology, and Sociology.  In consultation with the coure RCT faculty, students will develop a schedule that will satisfy the requirement for competence in a religious tradition through coursework.  Additionnally, students must demonstrate familiarity with a second religious tradition; this religious diversity requirement, depending on the judgement of the RCT faculty, may be satisfied by coursework done prior to attendance at Brown or by one or two additional courses at Brown.  Annual Meeting with FacultyThe student will meet annually with the RCT core faculty, normally toward the end of the spring semester.  This informal meeting is an opportunity to talk broadly about the student's trajectory in the program, that is, about one's past, preset, and future work.Language RequirementsAll students must pass examinations in French and German before taking their Preliminary Exams; subject to approval, French or German (but not both) may be replaced with an alternate.  Depending on their areas of interest, students may need to acquire additional language competence, for which there is no set examination structure.Preliminary ExaminationThe Preliminary Exams should be concluded within a year of completing the course work.  Normally, then, the Preliminary Exams would be concluded at the end of May of the student's third or fourth year (depending on whether the student entered the program with a bachelors or masters degree).  Three of the four Preliminary Exams may be satisfied by papers of not more than 10K words, including notes, or else (in the case of up to two of the three) by the more traditional format of a "take-home exam" on an extended reading list.  These three exams are defined as proficient treatment of:The fourth Preliminary Exam is a 10-page review essay of a noteworthy book pubished within the last 10 years or so.The topic and format of the four exams -- along with the order of their completion -- are proposed by the student to the RCT faculty and are subject to their approval.  This exam proposal (which covers all four exams) is normally submitted no later than the first week of classes in the fall semester of the year dedicated to the Exams.  Two exams must be completed by mid-January; students missing this deadline may not be considered for a dissertation fellowship for the following year.  Shortly after the conclusion of these exams, students will meet with the Advisory Faculty for a full discussion.   These meetings are an opportunity for intellectual exchange as well as an opportunity for the student to demonstrate competence in the fields of the exams (although passing of the exams is determined primarily by the quality of the student's written work).Following the completion of the exams, the dissertation prospectus should be defended in the early fall, preferably by the end of September.  For students who enter with a masters, this will be September of the fourth year; for students entering without a masters, this will be September of the fifth year.Recent DissertationsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

However, these bodies of knowledge are not just static symbols on the bamboo scroll or palm-leaf page.  Rather, they are enacted and enlivened through dramatic performance and artistic representations, which amplify, illuminate and question lessons from the textual sources.  In this way, conceptions of sanctity and religious authority are constructed, multiplied, and materialized through the imbrication of literary, material, and visual cultures.This colloquium is generously sponsored by the Graduate International Colloquium Fund, India Initiative, China Initiative, and the Departments of Religious Studies, Classics, and History of Art and Architecture.9:00-9:30am Coffee and Welcome9:30-10:00am State of the Field: Asia Across the Disciplines10:00-11:15am Manuscript Culture of Asia: Authority and Ideals of Kingship(Led by Prof. Adheesh Sathaye, University of British Columbia & Prof. Sarah Allan, Dartmouth)11:15-11:30am Coffee Break11:30-1:00pm Epigraphy & Paleography: Media and Meanings(Led by Prof. Adam Smith, University of Pennsylvania; Prof. Sarah Allan, Dartmouth; Prof. Tamara Sears, Yale University)1:00-2:00pm Lunch2:00-3:15pm Performance & Narrative(Led by Prof. Adheesh Sathaye, University of British Columbia; and Prof. David Buchta, Brown University)3:15-3:30pm Coffee Break3:30-4:45pm Sanctified Spaces: Monumental Places and the Construction of Authority(Led by Prof. Tamara Sears, Yale University & Prof. Padma Kaimal, Colgate University)5:00-6:00pm Public Lecture: "How to Become a Brahmin and Get Away With it: The Social Power of Hindu Mythology" (Joukowsky Forum, Watson Institute)(Prof. Adheesh Sathaye, University of British Columbia)One of the most well-known features of classical Hindu thought is that it is impossible for an ordinary individual to change one's caste.  But in the Sanskrit epics, the mythological sage, Viśvāmitra is said to have done exactly that - to have become a Brahmin by amassing a tremendous amount of acsetic power, or tapas.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownIntroduction:This conference seeks to explore and bridge the surprising gap between "genealogy" and "family" in the study of religion. Conversations about genealogy and family often appear disengaged from one another and can become embedded in problematic dichotomies. Genealogy implies patrilineal descent, while "domestic religion" is often used synonymously with "women's religion." Similarly, genealogy is associated with science, history, and rationality; family with nature, daily life, and emotion. Why have "family" and "genealogy" been bifurcated in religious studies? What can we learn from bringing them back together?By approaching these topics in tandem, we hope to engender critical reflection about the subtle relationships between "families" and "genealogies," and to interrogate the prevailing split that seems to separate the two.  Conference Schedule:Friday, March 18th9:00am: Introductory Remarks | Continental Breakfast9:30am-11:30am: Session 1: Mortality and MourningDiscussants: Daniel Picus and Caroline Kory, Brown University11:30am-1:00pm: Break1:00pm-3:00pm: Session II: Fictive FamiliesDiscussants: Adrien Stoloff and Justin Byrd, Brown University3:00pm-3:30pm: Break3:30pm - 5:30pm: Session III: Transmission and InheritanceDiscussant: Mark Cladis, Brown University6:00pm: Keynote Address: Professor Tomoko Masuzawa, University of MichiganSaturday, March 19th8:30am: Continental Breakfast9:00am-11:00am: Session IV: Adapting Across BoundariesDiscussants: Nicholas Friesner and Megan McBride, Brown University11:30am-12:30pm: Closing remarks by Professor Tomoko Masuzawa, University of Michigan. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownDaniel Vaca, Director of Undergraduate StudiesTina Creamer, Departmental Administrator Concentration in Religious Studies includes course work in Religious Studies 1000 (junior seminar in methods in the study of religion) and eight other courses conforming to the following requirements:Each student in consultation with appropriate faculty members devises a concentration program, which may include up to three courses given outside the department.  The student presents (for approval by the concentration advisor) a written statement of the objectives of his or her concentration program and a list of the component courses.  The program is expected to encompass the study of at least one religious tradition from each of the following groups. Ordinarily, this requirement is satisfied by two or more courses in each of these areas:The plan of study must take account of more than one approach to the study of religion, e.g., philosophical and historical; contain at least two Intermediate-level courses (0200-0999), RELS 1000, and two additional advanced-level courses (above 1000).   This means that no more than four courses (out of nine) can be at the introductory level.No later than the end of spring registration in the junior year, the concentrator will determine if they wish to write an honors thesis or choose a capstone course for his or her concentration. A capstone course will be selected in consultation with the concentration advisor and other faculty as appropriate. Within the frame of this capstone course, the concentrator will address the theoretical and interpretive issues of his or her particular focus in the Religious Studies concentration.HONORSTo receive Honors in Religious Studies, a student must write an Honors Thesis. A thesis is an opportunity for students to conduct extended independent research under the guidance of faculty. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 (A=4, B=3, C=2) on courses that count toward the concentration. Additionally, to be eligible for honors, concentrators can elect to take no more than two of the concentration courses with the "S/NC" option, after declaring an RS concentration. (If a student is philosophically committed to taking the majority of her or his courses as Brown as "S/NC," that student may petition the Department to waive the "S/NC" limit.) Writing the thesis is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for receiving Honors. The thesis must earn an A from its readers for the student to receive Honors, and the student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 in the concentration (as well as satisfy all the other concentration requirements). Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownDaniel Vaca, Director of Undergraduate StudiesTina Creamer, Departmental AdministratorReligious Studies explores religious thought and practice in various historical, cultual, and social contexts, in order to understand and interpret societies and cultures throughout the world.  It fosters scholarly skills such as close reading (of text, images, artifacts, and other social data), excellence in writing and verbal expression, interpretation of the past from multiple forms of evidence, and assessment of contemporary social issues.  By exploring the public and private concerns that a focus on religion highlights - for example, the creation of community, the nature of the individual, suffering, and death, good and evil - students discover new ways of interpreting the complex world in which they live.  As studens examine religious activity in regions like Asia, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, they not only learn about the formation and transmission of beliefs, behaviors, values, rituals, and identities but also come to understand how divers peoples have expressed religious understandings of themselves and others through social policies, institutions, and conflicts often seen as secular1. Basic RequirmentA concentration in religious studies includes a minimum of nine semester-long courses, including RELS 1000 (a junior seminar in methods in the study of religion) and eight other courses conforming to the concentration requirements.  Students who transfer to Brown or study abroad must complete at least five courses in Religious Studies.2. Distribution of Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced CoursesAmong the eight concentration courses, no more than four courses (out of nine) can be at the introductory level (below 1000).  In addition to any introductory courses and RELS 1000, the plan of study must include at least two intermediate-level courses (0200-0999) and  two advanced level courses (above 1000).3. Geographic and Methodological DistributionIn order to ensure that students study a diveristy of religious traditions, through multiple methods of study, ethe eight concentration courses (in addition to RELS 1000) must: 1) reflect more than one approach to the study of religion (e.g., philosophical and historical); and 2) examine more than one religious tradition.  To ensure that students examine multiple traditions, the plan of study ordinarily should include two or more courses in each of these areas:- Traditions that emerge from West Asia and the Mediterranean world (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Islam).- Traditions that emerge from South and East Asis (e.g., Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism)4.  Courses in Other DepartmentsCourses listed in other departments but taught by religious studies faculty count toward the program of study.  In addition to courses taught by religious studies faculty, up to three courses taught by faculty in other departments can count toward the program.  Students who transfer to Brown, study abroad, or otherwise petition to include Brwon courses not cross-listed with Religious Studies must still complete at least five courses in Religious Studies.5. Capstone ProjectNo later than the end of spring registration in the junior year, the concentrator will determine how he or she will complete a capstone project for the requirement - either by selecting a capstone course, or by undertaking an honors thesis.  A capstone course will be selected in consultation with the concentration advisor and other faculty as appropriate.  Within the frame of this capstone course and through work completed for the course, the concentrator will address the theoretical and interpretive issues of his or her particular focus in the religious studies concentration.Honors Thesis (Optional)A thesis is an opportunity for students to conduct extended independent research under the guidance of faculty.  If a student chooses to write an honors thesis, in addition to completing the typical eight concentration courses (in addition to RELS 1000), the student will enroll in RELS 1999 during both semesters of the senior year.  Whether or not a student receives honors, RELS 1999 will serve as the student's capstone course.  To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have eanred a grade point average of greater than 3.5 (A=4, B=3, C=2) on courses that count toward the concentration.  Additionally, to be eligible for honors, concentrators take no more than two of the concentration courses with the "S/NC" option, after declaring a Religious Studies concentration.  (Note: if a student is philosophically committed to taking the majority of her or his courses at Brown as "S/NC," that student may petition the Department to waive the "S/NC" limit.)  Writing the thesis is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for receiving Honors.  In order to receive Honors, the student's thesis must earn an A from its readers, and the student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 in the concentration and satisfied all other concetration requirements.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownDescriptions for Religious Studies Concentrators.  What is the difference between a Capstone and a Thesis?To complete a concentration in Religious Studies, a student must either a) complete a course designated as a capstone course, or b) write a senior Honors Thesis.  The decision regarding which of these options a student wishes to pursue must be made by the end of the student's sixth semester (normally the spring of junior year).Capstone Course: The capstone requirement is designed to provide a culminating focus for a student's concentration.  The content of the course designated as a capstone should build on a student's previous work in the department and at Brown.  The background should enable the student to engage the topic of the course with a depth and sophistication he or she could not bring to just any course.  In principle, any course offered by the department can be designated a capstone course, including independent studies.  In practice, most students designate an upper-level course or seminar as their capstone course.  When the student has a potential capstone course in mind, he or she should approach the faculty member teaching the course and ask about the possibility of using the course as a capstone.  If the faculty member agrees, a discussion about the nature and form of the capstone project itself should take place.  The faculty member may require periodic meetings in addition to the regularly scheduled class meetings, or may ask the student to write a more substantial research paper than the other students in the class, etc.  In the fall of senior year, the student should fill out a capstone proposal form, write the castone proposal itself, obtain the necessary signatures, and submit these materials to the Departmental Administrator, Tina Creamer.  Honors Thesis:To receive Honors in Religious Studies, a student must write an Honors Thesis.  A thesis is an opportunity for students to conduct extended independent research under the guidance of faculty.  To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 (A=4, B=3, C=2) on courses that count toward the concentration. Additionally, to be eligible for honors, concentrators can elect to take no more than two of the concentration courses with the "S/NC" option, after declaring an RS concentration. (If a student is philosophically committed to taking the majority of her or his courses as Brown as “S/NC,” that student may petition the Department to waive the “S/NC” limit.) Writing the thesis is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for receiving Honors. The thesis must earn an A from its readers for the student to receive Honors, and the student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 in the concentration (as well as satisfy all the other concentration requirements).     Students write their thesis in their final two semesters.  In his or her sixth semester, a student contemplating a thesis should approach the faculty member with whom he or she hopes to work.  The student should ask the faculty member if he or she is open to the idea of working with the student on the thesis.  The faculty member may decline for any number of reasons or may suggest other members of the department better suited to work with the student.  If the faculty member agrees to advise the thesis, the student begins honing the topic of the thesis in consultation with the faculty member.  Before the student finishes the sixth semester, the contours of the project should be laid out so that the student can commence productive research at the very beginning of the sventh semester.  In the spring of junior year, the student should fill out a senior project information form, write a thesis proposal, obtain the necessary signatures, and submit all these materials to the Departmental Administrator, Tina Creamer.Questions?
