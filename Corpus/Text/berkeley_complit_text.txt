Congratulations Irina Popescu and Mary Mussman!  Irina won the Samuel C. Irving Prize for American Wit and Humor and came in 2nd place for the Lili Fabilli and Eric Hoffer Essay prize, while Mary won the Emily Chamberlain Cook Prize.Judge’s comments on Irina Popescu’s “From NAMUH to GOD” (Irving Prize):“‘From NAMUH to GOD'” is a humorous poem that poses the question, in a fresh and witty manner: did we domesticate dogs or did they domesticate us?  The narrator aspires to be a pit-bull:  ‘They got a bad rap, but I’d be the coolest pit-bull around. / I’d lay on your lap and run marathons with you.  / I’d have a black patch on one eye like a pirate. / I’d have a cute snore that you would record and put on Youtube.'” Judge’s comments on Mary Mussman’s “Greek Poetry Composition”:“‘Greek Poetry Composition,’ dedicated to Max Ritvo, a Los Angeles poet who died of cancer in 2016 at the age of 25, is a complex and often startling poem.  It is an elegy for Ritvo wrapped inside of a framing conceit, within which is gathered several brief narratives about love, learning, sex, and death.  I especially admire the poet’s ability to shift and bend registers, and the poem moves from the matter-of-fact quasi-academic style of the opening stanzas to an anecdotal register about halfway before intertwining several registers within the poem’s powerful final stanzas.  This poem is intellectually ambitious, describing not only the process of reading ancient Greek – working one’s way through ‘the salt flats of ancient text’ – but also speculating on what we might call the poetics of astrophysics.”We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

A first generation Nigerian born and raised in the Bay Area, she grew up in Antioch, CA and was a part of the first graduating class of Dozier-Libbey Medical High School.  English is her primary language, but she grew up around Igbo as well. Winner of the Gilman Fellowship, she tells Comparative Literature chair Miryam Sas about her plans.
CL: Ozi, we’re so proud of your win. What are you planning to do with the Gilman Fellowship?I will be participating in the Multi-Site study abroad program in Paris and London where I engage in studies around space, identity, and citizenship. I will be documenting my experience on an online blog so people can also experience these places with me!CL: How did you get interested in Comparative Literature?I have always had a love for reading and writing. When I was younger, I spent a lot of summers buried in books and if I wasn’t reading, I was writing short stories in composition books then creating covers for each one. It only seemed natural for me that whatever I chose to study in college would be centered around my passions. So, as I sat in my room and explored majors at Berkeley four years ago, Comparative Literature with its broad approach to literary studies seemed too good to be true.I arrived at Berkeley as a declared Comparative Literature major and if I had to do it all over again, there is nothing that I would change about that. It has kept me grounded and continues to develop my writing as well as analytical skills, but what I really love about the major is that it encourages me to study beyond my comfort zone and to delve into other worlds, experiences, and narratives. I have spent a large majority of my college career- specifically my first, second, and third years- studying French and French literature, which is not a native language for me so was indeed challenging yet extremely rewarding. When I reflect on my newfound abilities to read novels, write papers, and hold conversations in French, I realize that it it offers me entry into so many unfamiliar spaces and places. However, I have not been bound only to French, but rather have had the chance to incorporate disciplines such as English, African-American Studies, and Ethnic Studies, to shape my experience as a Comparative Literature major.CL: Who are some of your favorite writers? What have been some of your favorite classes in Comp Lit?I enjoy a wide variety of writers so I don’t think that I necessarily have a favorite, but if there is one that has reoriented my idea of what writing can look like and continues to make me thing critically, I would say James Baldwin!  Truthfully, I think I have enjoyed each of my Comp Lit classes, but my intro class with Professor Francine Masiello, which focused on narratives in spaces considered to be of the “South” was foundational in my aim to utilize Comp Lit as a means to study literary pieces on marginality or peripheral experiences. This semester I took a class with Professor Judith Butler, which was exciting to hold space with a scholar who have been reading since my first year at Cal, but also because the class focused on the works of Franz Kafka with whom I am largely unfamiliar—it was intriguing to say the least!CL:  What has your experience in Comp Lit been like?I would describe my experience to be like a river…like a steady flow that reaches a larger body of water, it has been a point in my life that only adds to my greater knowledge, being, and politics. It has been helpful to develop my writing. I am honored to be published by the Comp Lit Undergrad Journal this fall, which for me reflects the opportunities that the major makes available to its students. I would say that it has been accessible as I can always reach my advisor for help! However, I would love to come back in a few years and see more representation of different experiences and identities in the major classes. It is an exciting field that most students do not even realize exists or they may misunderstand how useful it can be in future endeavors  because a liberal arts degree is wrongfully undervalued.  Just an additional plug for folks to check out the Comp Lit Undergrad Journal to read my piece and also to stay tuned for the blog where people can keep up to date with my travel experiences!CL: Thanks so much Ozi! We look forward to your article and your blog, and bon voyage! We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page. But we'll leave it to you to decide if this is where you are supposed to be. What drew you to this place? Is there something you can learn from it in your short time here? Look deep into your soul.

H. CruzTaking on the attributes of the opposite gender is as ancient an act as it is problematic. What exactly is so threatening about this kind of crossing? As with most kinds of border disruptions, this one threatens to spread and multiply to other types or kinds of disruptions and must therefore almost always be contained. However, not all crossings are as dangerous. Some even serve to reinforce the received hierarchy of gender while others risk dissolving the very basis of our society. In this class we will examine various examples of masculine women and feminine men across a variety of genres and time periods, in order to identify any possible connections between gender and genre. We will also look closely at the political implications of these crossings for different communities, societies and the states.Texts:Films:Course Catalog Number:

T. Warner & Mandy CohenFrom the Tower of Babel through contemporary narratives of immigration, exile, and displacement, linguistic confusion is a venerable motif. So what is a reader to make of a story that “stops making sense?” In this course we will read and discuss many varieties of linguistic confusion. These will include multilingual texts that address multiple audiences, as well as works that mix sacred, profane, and even dead languages. Some of our readings will frustrate interpretation with secret codes while others will tantalize with open secrets. We will also discuss mixed media works that employ several genres. By considering novels, plays, films, poems and comics that refuse to be transparent in their communication, we will take linguistic confusion not as a problem to be solved but as a strategy that can be productive and provocative. This being a 1B course, the focus will be as much on writing as on reading. Our hope is that the confusion we confront in our readings will help us develop valuable analytical tools in class discussion and hone our ability to write subtly, critically, and insightfully.Readings may include:Course Catalog Number:

J. BulgerThe term “Modernism” coarsely describes a cultural movement that began during the sunset of the nineteenth century and continued into the first half of the twentieth century. Modernists experimented with new ideas and forms in order to liberate their arts from tradition. Yet as artists strove headlong into the future, they did look in the rear-view mirror to the distant past – to antiquity. In particular, Greek and Roman ideas, forms and texts litter the modernist literary canon as modernist authors translate and transmute the works of classical antiquity in order to advance their artistic projects.This course will examine the modernists’ engagement of classical Greek and Roman works. Why does the modernist author use the ancient in a project to create the new? How does the author give a new voice to ancient ideas and forms? What is lost or gained in the shuttling of material between 2000 years? How can ancient material refer to a modern context? As a reader, what is our relationship with the modern text, if we know the ancient source?Our readings will focus on a series of paired texts – one classical and one modern. We will begin in the 19th century and see how authors are using classical texts so as to highlight the differences or similarities found in the modernists. In our journey between periods and texts, we will get to know figures such as Odysseus, Tiresias, Helen and Orpheus as both classical and modernist characters. As we engage with different texts and their respective heroes, we will focus on not only how the authors rethink “stories” or characters, but also how and why they rework genres, such as epic, lyric and drama. We will consider, furthermore, how modernist film and opera engage classical characters and stories.This examination of how modernists read and revise ancient texts and literary structures will inform a sustained dedication to making you a better reader and reviser. Bouncing between millennia on the hunt for ancient voices and modernist re-vocalizations, you will be developing your own voice through a number of in-class and take-home writing assignments. As a 1A/1B class, you will learn to read texts closely and analyze them critically. With respect to your writing skills, you will master the basics of sentence structure, paragraph development and essay composition. In the spirit of this course, you will write and revise, revise, revise your old work.PRINCIPAL TEXTSCourse Catalog Number:

SetterHow is it that what seem to be our most spontaneous, personal, and intimate experiences – love, desire, affection – tend to appear as banal, scripted ones? Or is this only a function of the way – highly formalized indeed – in which these private experiences are represented in communicable, repetitive, public words? What is the role of speech, linguistic gestures, address and call, narration and self-narration, in desire, and what is the relationship between desire and writing – the writing of desire and the desire to write? Is it possible to talk or write about desire without betraying it? Or in Raymond Carver’s words, “what do we talk about when we talk about love”?We’ll start the course by considering Roland Barthes’s suggestion that the basic structure of a lover’s discourse is “someone speaking within himself, amorously, confronting the other, the loved object, who does not speak.” Then, while reading novels, short stories, poems, and letters, and watching films, we’ll follow, examine, refine, and complicate this structure. Among the things which might help us challenge, or maybe reinforce, it are: the possible existence of a speaking beloved, the significant role of the narrator/voyeur within the erotic scene, pederasty as an alternative organization of desire, pedophilia as a potential form of love, the ascetic/sexual love of knowledge, and the realistic utopia of an erotic community. In addition to reading widely in these different forms of writing desire, we will also try to increase our own, or at least improve our writing skills and get to know our desires better.Texts will include:The Song of SongsBarthes, Lover’s DiscourseGoethe, The Sorrows of Young WertherDuras, Ravishing of Lol SteinPoems by Sappho, Frank O’Hara, Jack Spicer, Adrienne RichPoems/letters by Emily Dickinson Films:Capturing the Friedmans (Jarecki)Contempt (Godard)Course Catalog Number:

G. ZupsichIn this course we will investigate absurdist humor as a mode of social critique and means of philosophical teaching. Our discussions will touch on a broad range of theories of the absurd from Kierkegaard and Camus philosophical inquiries into social ethics and the human experience to Vian, Artaud and Beckett’s aesthetic responses to certain existential and social problems posed by philosophical Absurdism. Questions we might consider include What is absurdity and why does it make us laugh? Are there some subjects that should not be mocked? Why or why not? Should absurdity be a laughing matter?We will examine various comedic treatments of absurdist themes in French, Spanish, British and American texts from Renaissance and neoclassical antecedents to the absurd to 20th-century American comedic film. Some of these texts explore the absurdity of marriage and family life, nobility, medicine and education, while others recount the adventures of absurdist heroes or comment on absurdity and the search for meaning in everyday life. Independent student research will be centered on theories of humor in film and literature. Students will write 3 papers, the first of which will be 3 pages and the following 7-8 pages each with outside critical support.

B. Clancy & A. TranA central aspect of the aesthetics of the novel involves the task of representing the passage of time. This course will start by looking at how literary temporality is addressed in antiquity in order to gain a better understanding of the role that the representation of time plays in establishing the sets of criteria that help to define literary genres. Another concern of the course will thus be to determine the way in which the novel’s various approaches to time, particularly in the twentieth-century, play a crucial factor in the aesthetic innovation of the genre. Here we will examine time in relation to things such plot-structure, characterization, style, and epistemology. We will then focus on distinct techniques used by twentieth-century authors to engage with this problem, seeing how such techniques produce unique images of temporality, as well as what the broader implications of such developments might be for narrative aesthetics in general.Texts:Aristotle, The PoeticsHomer, The OdysseySophocles, Oedipus the KingShakespeare, King LearVirginia Woolf, To the LighthouseMarcel Proust, Swann’s WayJames Joyce, UlyssesFranz Kafka, The Metamorphosis

S. Schwartz & M. ZaydmanIn this class, we will explore the idea that texts are made up of moving parts—not just that books are composed of pages that turn, or that “film” means a series of still images running through a projector.  We will also consider the possibility that the whole inside of a text consists of elements that are constantly, and not always predictably, in motion.  In an actual mechanical object, moving parts—housed inside a stable structure—are supposed to go on clicking and whirring and spinning and interlocking; that’s how the device works.  However, mechanically speaking, they are also the components in a machine that tend to break down and wear out, to cause trouble, to disrupt the process.What happens when the mobile part of a story refuses to move the way it should, or when the images of a film won’t progress in the proper order? If a moving part fails, can another mechanical part substitute for it? Can some parts—characters, for example, or category nouns—be considered more or less interchangeable?  When the moving parts of a text confuse themselves with the stable structure that surrounds them, is it dangerous?Mechanical designers generally try to reduce the number of moving parts, because of these components’ tendency to end up in some kind of entropic or chaotic state.  Poets, filmmakers, choreographers, photographers, writers, sculptors, and painters, on the other hand, seem to love this state—and all of the possible kinds of moving parts that get them into it.  Working with this premise, we will explore a set of texts with hyper-mobile parts, mechanical problems, bent wire and thin string, strange substitutions, the tendency to go backwards in third gear, shifting frames, frozen screens, lost directions, bad reception, and something that keeps rattling when you turn it upside-down.  Students will have the opportunity to analyze these texts individually as well as collaboratively, and to create written papers and multi-media presentations that express their unique insights and ideas.  This class includes two formal papers and many short writing assignments, and places a strong emphasis on active, creative student participation.BooksIf On A Winter’s Night a Traveler—Italo CalvinoOthello—William ShakespeareThe Age of Wire and String—Ben MarcusFilmsVertigo—Alfred HitchcockModern Times—Charlie ChaplinThe Mirror (Zerkalo)—Andrei TarkovskyMeshes of the Afternoon—Maya DerenA Study in Choreography for Camera—Maya DerenLa Jetée—Chris MarkerVisual and Performing ArtSelected Untitled Film Stills (photographs)—Cindy ShermanSelected paintings—Gerhard RichterArtifact Suite (dance)—William ForsytheSynchronous Objects for One Flat Thing, reproduced(dance/architecture) —William ForsytheSelections in the course reader: Metamorphoses (Ovid), “The Nose” (Gogol), Hopscotch (Cortázar),The Gay Science (Nietzsche), Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (Freud), Capital (Marx), “Art as a Device” (Shklovsky)Course Catalog Number:

J. Bodik & S. CochranLiterature is often about conflict—about individuals, nations, and worldviews at odds with one another. Within texts, characters “plot” and scheme against one another, and texts themselves can become involved in the social and political contentions that continually unfold in the real world.  Conflict in literature, in turn, is at the heart of narrative intrigue.  And intrigue often has a great deal to do with how individuals cope with their differences: how they define themselves and strive to define others.  In this course we will explore how intrigue as a literary phenomenon is not just a force that drives plot forward but also a lens through which to study the construction and representation of identity.This is a writing-intensive course with an emphasis on the development of research skills.  In addition to frequent short homework and in-class writing assignments, students will be expected to write a midterm paper and a final research paper.Texts:Homer, The OdysseyShakespeare, OthelloThomas Wyatt, selected poemsPierre Choderlos de Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons Charlotte Perkins Gilman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”Franz Kafka, “A Hunger Artist”William Faulkner, “A Rose for Emily”Martin Luther King, “Letter from Birmingham Jail”Ishmael Reed, The Terrible TwosFilm:James Toback, Black and WhiteBeeban Kidron, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

S. ChihayaContrary to popular belief, it takes a lot of energy to do nothing. This course will investigate the activity of inactivity – what do we really do when we’re supposedly not doing anything? From classic exemplars of idleness and indecision to contemporary depictions of procrastination and all-out ineptitude, we will examine the various anxieties, difficulties and pleasures that surround inactivity. How do characters “kill time” and why do they need to? How do writers and filmmakers depict this odd space of nothingness – and still hold our attention? What is it about the figures of the idler, procrastinator, and slacker that make them so appealing to us? How do we deal with characters that are actively indecisive, or alternately, decisively idle? Finally, why are we so fascinated with our own inability to act?Through a wide range of readings and viewings, we will seek to answer these questions and more.

We will consider how experimenting with different ideas of alternative humanities, whether by human integration with the decidedly (or not so decidedly) nonhuman or by exposure to extreme circumstances, serves to highlight and/or question prevailing values. Such speculation and experimentation allows these texts to demonstrate their political and philosophical relevance, in addition to giving us the opportunity to analyze how fiction functions as an expository mode of writing. Likewise, a heavy load of writing assignments will emphasize how to assume a critical (as opposed to a moral or purely aesthetic/affective) stance and how make a logically coherent literary argument. Readings include fantastic, science fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction and film, in addition to several articles of literary criticism and relevant non-fiction essays that will act as models for your own analysis and research.Readings: Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, Selections from Milton’s Paradise Lost, Ursula K.

T. Wolff & J. HockCan one talk about a story without mentioning a hero? Must a hero always be the story’s center? If so, who (and what) is at the periphery — that is, what sets the hero apart from a crowd? What distinguishes traditional “foil” characters from the conventional hero (e.g. villains, outcasts, eccentrics, fools), and what happens when these characters gravitate toward the story’s center, i.e., begin to steal the show? How does the figure of the hero adapt and transform according to cultural desires and preoccupations? Perhaps we should agree that in the end, each hero is simply the product of a poet’s creative powers, as Maurice Blanchot suggests: “The hero is born when the singer comes forward in the great hall.” Then the question becomes: How does an author, or even the text itself, assume the hero’s vanity to become the centerpiece of a fiction?In this course, we’ll try to attack some of these big questions about heroic stereotypes across various literary forms and periods, by looking at, for example, a clever domestic servant, an existential anti-hero, and a bumbling detective. Our underlying motive throughout, however, will be to observe and describe the story’s counter-narratives. We will experiment with imagining the story and its hero as one perspective or argument, and investigate what alternative perspectives, or “arguments against,” the story proposes. A recurring theme will thus be issues of narrative centrality and eccentricity, of deviation and social hierarchy. There will be extra assignments along the way (including readings, written work, additional film viewings, and in-class presentations), but the emphasis is on literary and critical analysis — though we will also be analyzing things like news media, advertisements, and cartoons.

A. YoungHow do the dead speak?  How does history make itself felt as a painful or disquieting presence? In this course we will examine how the past haunts “the modern” in a number of theoretical and literary texts.“Modernism” refers to a wide range of artistic trends that emerged out of the political, technological and social upheavals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the wake of monumental change, many writers and artists found conventional modes of representation inadequate, abandoning them in pursuit of novelty and formal experimentation. But breaking with tradition did not necessarily mean turning one’s back on the past. Indeed, how to reckon with the past is a question posed, either implicitly or explicitly, in many modernist texts. We will read works by Vallejo, Woolf, Eliot and other nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors who explore the demands the dead—both literal and figurative—make on the living.Readings will include:César Vallejo, selected poemsRainer Maria Rilke, Duino ElegiesT.S. Eliot, The Waste LandVirginia Woolf, To the LighthouseHenrik Ibsen, GhostsWilliam Shakespeare, HamletJuan Rulfo, “No Dogs Bark”James Joyce, “The Dead”Arthur Schnitzler, “The Dead Do not Speak,” “The Second”Pablo Neruda, “From the Heights of Machu Picchu”Paul Celan, selected poemsAdditionally, we will read critical essays by Eliot, Woolf, Matei Calinescu, Raymond Williams, Octavio Paz and others.Course Catalog Number:

WeinerRomance proposes that we discover love through the act of reading about the experiences of its protagonists.  These stories help us to refine our ideas of love, both in its constructive and destructive capacities.  Tales centering on love define it by way of other central human emotions and cultural activities.  Stories of wandering and lust, wars and conflicts within society, sickness, death and loss are the avenues along which literature’s heroes travel to discover, lose, and often recover love.  In this course, we will begin by exploring the romance genre, which has established the rules and the models of amorous narratives, and thereby conditioned our expectations of the love story.  How does it employ the literary artifices of providence, coincidence, and repetition to structure our experience?  And how do the social forces of loss and social upheaval create the conditions and produce the circumstances for the elaboration of familial and romantic love?After introducing the romance paradigm, we will go on to explore other models emphasizing different aspects of the human psyche and our various cultural and social conflicts across the centuries.  Focusing on the opposition between constructive and destructive love, we will read stories centering on loss, lust and the compulsion to repeat, sickness and death, money, social upheaval, and class strife.  We will also encounter less comfortable passionate expressions of the human psyche, such as mourning, narcissism, sadism/masochism, and the death drive.  Readings come from the French, Italian, Spanish, German, Latin American, and Anglophone traditions, spanning the first through twentieth centuries.  We will supplement our reading of the literary texts with psychoanalytic theory, philosophy of literature, structuralist and post-structuralist theories.NOTE:  This class includes several long novels and should only be undertaken by those who have the time to spend reading.  Students are expected to read Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind before the first day of class.

N.  Cleaver“In Bologna I once heard many vices of the devil told, among which I heard that he is a liar and the father of lies.” (Inferno 23.142-4)“Hail, horrors, hail, / Infernal world, and thou, profoundest Hell, / Receive thy new possessor: one who brings / A mind not changed by place or time. / The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heaven out of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.” (Paradise Lost 1.250-5)“Think, now: where would your good be if there were no evil and what would the world look like without shadow?” (Master and Margarita)Monsters, demons, witches and other evil creatures have surfaced almost continuously in the cultural imagination, from classical epics to the horror film.  In this course, we will examine representations of evil in its purest form, the figure of the Satan himself. How does the portrait of the devil change over time and across various cultural boundaries? If evil is that which a society strives to avoid, why does the devil appear so often in literature, and why does he make so charming a protagonist? Why and how are we encouraged to sympathize with him as an anti-hero?  In artistic terms, is Evil simply more interesting than Good?Beginning with Dante and Milton, we will consider the character of the devil in theological terms. What explanations do these texts offer for the existence of evil? Is it fundamentally a human quality, or is it divine/supernatural in nature? With these authors, as well as with Bulgakov and Rushdie, we will also examine the way in which the character of the devil reflects their concerns with the political conflicts of their time as a contemporary assessment of the nature of human evil: the turmoil of trecento Italy, Reformation England, Soviet Russia, and post-colonial India. What are the political consequences of representing the world as an eternal opposition between good and evil?We will conclude with readings from Barnes and Garcia Marquez which move beyond this dualism, and question whether there exists anything which can be characterized as good or evil, and whether a belief in absolute evil may not be dangerous in itself.  Throughout this course, we will also consider related examples from the visual arts, including the drawings and paintings of Gustave Doré, Hieronymus Bosch, and William Blake.

T. HamptonDiscussion Sections:In many ways Shakespeare is the literary inventor of modernity. His plays depict the psychological, political, economic, and social upheavals that mark the transition from the pre-modern world to a world that is recognizably our own. But he is also the most international of all writers. This course will explore Shakespeare’s extraordinary literary originality by studying his most influential plays in an international context. We will locate Shakespeare in the culture of his period by reading his plays in dialogue with masterworks from across Renaissance Europe. We will consider how he and his contemporaries engage with issues of international scope at a time (like our own) of extraordinary political, religious, and economic turmoil. We will read eight major plays by Shakespeare, as well as works by Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Cervantes, Erasmus, and Petrarch. This course thus offers an introduction to early modern Europe, an exercise in reading literature in an international context, and an in-depth study of a major author.Reading List:Course Catalog Number:

In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party sometime, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S.

A. GadberryIn this course, we will consider the importance of cruelty to theatre and the various ways in which theatre portrays and defines it.  We will look at plays that have particularly savage acts at their center (or just offstage…), and we will ask ourselves how and why these plays cast cruelty, its victims, and its agents as they do.  In doing so, we’ll consider what it might mean to use this medium in particular to represent cruelty, what the stakes are of allowing the cruel to gaze back into its viewers.   We’ll ask ourselves what the theatre of cruelty can do and how it might (and might not) continue its work into the theatre of the world.  How does theatre modulate, exaggerate, or banalize the cruelty of its protagonists?  How does it handle the victim, the bystander, the “collateral damage” ?  What’s left after the cruel performance; what catharsis from cruelty is available (or not)?  What relationships do these plays forge between the cruelties they portray and the viewer who beholds them?We will read plays across cultures and time periods, and we will examine other primary and secondary texts that concern themselves with both cruelty and theatre — in particular those that worry about real cruelties in the real world — as well as spectacles of punishment and power as we consider the dimensions political, social, and aesthetic of cruelty on stage.Please note:  There will be required screenings of film adaptations of some of the plays we  discuss in class, and there likely will be an excursion to a local theatrical performance.Required Texts:– Aeschylus.  Agamemnon.

Luis RamosThis course takes as its object of reflection a question Gustavo Pérez Firmat nearly two decades ago posed:  Do the Americas share a common literature? That is, do the two Americas, both North and South, mainland and insular, polar and equatorial, share—if not geographic—textual common ground? If so, what similar literary strategies and common critical concerns might such an ensemble of texts bring to the fore? This course takes up these questions from a historical—and materialist—perspective; that is, from one that views history (and by extension, literature) from the violent and traumatic conditions from which they both emerge. In so doing, however, we will not subscribe to a deterministic or defeatist view of either, but rather, to one wherein both emancipation and conquest, resistance and domination, dispossession and regeneration, are accounted for in equal measure. Thus students should expect not only to devise novel strategies of conceiving the relation between literary traditions typically understood as distinct, but moreover, to articulate previously unforeseen ways of thinking about the Americas as an expanded category of aesthetic and geopolitical thought. In keeping with the above aims, the course will be structured into four related units: The meaning of freedom and self-awareness in Anglo American and Latin American republican thought (1); the burden of chattel slavery in Afro Cuban and African American testimonial narrative (2); the legacies of conquest in American Indian and Mayan historical consciousness (3); and finally, the histories of Chinese new world migration in Asian American and Cuban American fiction (4).Required texts:Films:*Course reader including seminal texts in political and critical thought (Jefferson, Bolivar, Emerson, Marti, Arendt, Derrida Saldivar and Hartman) will be available the first day of class.Course Catalog Number:

Students are expected to have some competence in at least one foreign language and to be acquainted with the rudiments of literary analysis. The thematic focus of this course will be crises of patrilinearity—family romances gone sour. More specifically, we will be looking at how such family crises enable and generate narratives, but also perturb them; how subjects are constituted and deconstructed through descent groups; how the crisis of patrilinearity can become an emblem in literary texts for other cultural crises; and how this theme intersects with the issues of gender and race. Course requirements include three short writing assignments and a final paper based on an oral presentation of a text chosen by the student and read outside of class.Our reading will embrace both literary texts and theoretical/critical discussions of them. Primary reading will include:Homer Odyssey (tr. Lattimore)Aeschylus Oresteia (tr. Lattimore)Sophocles Oedipus the King (tr. Fagles)Euripides Medea (tr. R.

M. BernsteinAlthough our subject is “Modernism’s Epic Ambitions,” I will not be concentrating solely upon the relationships of the works we are discussing to any single over-arching motif, nor to various more traditional literary-philosophical taxonomies. Instead, I want to explore a set of issues, both historical and theoretical, whose specific family resemblance will only emerge as our discussion itself unfolds.  Close attention will be paid to the ways in which modernist artists experimented with the technical issues of form and structure as well as with their innovative use of new thematic materials.In the first part of the semester, we will be investigating several of the most important modernists figures involved in both the theoretical conception and the artistic creation of a new sense of what a modernist masterpiece entails. From that foundation, we will read James Joyce’s Ulysses, the archetypal modernist prose masterpiece. Regular and active in-class participation and a willingness to engage in copious reading are the principal prerequisites for the course.Required Reading:Various hand-outsJames Joyce, Ulysses, Random House (paperback)Course Catalog Number:

First, we will investigate the history of the lyric genre and consider both the continuities and discontinuities within what has been labeled “lyric” in different periods, literatures, cultures. What are the advantages and disadvantages of thinking of these disparate forms as manifestations of a common genre? Second, we will be examining the contexts in which lyric has been produced and circulated at any given historical moment — how do factors such as educational practice, orality, musical accompaniment, performance, printing, canonization, etc. affect the way lyric looks and sounds? These two sets of questions are not independent and throughout the semester we will be working on both tracks simultaneously. The selection of readings will include some classical Latin and Greek and some examples of English and Italian Renaissance sonnets. Other periods, languages and sub-genres will be chosen on the basis of student interests.Course Catalog Number:

Ashley Brock and Jordan BulgerContemporary debates about social matters often turn to nature to decide them.  Parties debating a common issue will attempt a familiar gesture: each will claim that its position is natural and therefore true. Why would an appeal to nature decide a social issue and what relationship between society and nature does this appeal assume?This course will consider what literature can contribute to an understanding of nature and society and their relationship.  While mining the literatures of disparate times and places, we will explore the implications of different modes of seeing the relationship between the natural and the human: as one of opposition, continuity, determinacy, etc. We will also consider the multiplicity of “natures” that have been generated in different cultural contexts, historical moments, and individual situations.As we consider nature from the various vantage points offered by our literary texts, you will be encouraged to think about the argumentative appropriation of nature in contemporary debates: gender, race, class, sexual orientation; development versus conservation; local versus global; old versus new; science versus religion; man versus animal; and individual versus collective.In addition to focusing on the ways in which nature and society appear within the texts, we will also examine the role of fiction in shaping our cultural values and public policies with regards to nature. Why would one choose the written word as an approach to the natural world in the first place? What can literature do that other ways of thinking about nature cannot? Most urgently, what kind of solutions or insights can literature offer to those of us trying to address problems and tensions in the world beyond the written page?Throughout the semester, we will ask how reading about fictional worlds can be a means of better understanding our lived world: how do the situations and characters we encounter in the texts invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and decisions? In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument.Reading List may include:Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps

L. Ramos & L. WagnerWhat is world literature? In this reading and writing intensive course, we will examine works of literature not simply as products of their local environment, but rather, as windows into global cultural relations. In other words, we will uncover how writers imagine a world beyond their immediate circumstances by situating their work in an international context. Beginning with the concept’s origins in Goethe and Marx, we will read works that reveal an understanding of the world as a planetary order in concert and in conflict and as a geopolitical space of antagonisms and alliances. By closely examining texts that dramatize the relation between the local and the global in its manifold manifestations (center versus periphery, metropole versus colony, north versus south and private versus public), our aim will be to unsettle common assumptions about the nation as the primary locus of literary enunciation. However, rather than subscribe to a cosmopolitan view divorced from history or politics, we will strive precisely to reveal both the perils and the promise, both the pitfalls and possibilities inherent in the exchange between cultures across national boundaries.Texts:The Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Kingdom of this World, Alejo CarpentierHeart of Darkness, Joseph ConradSeason of Migration to the North, Tayeb SalihAutobiography of My Mother, Jamaica KincaidFilms:Happy Together, Wong Kar WaiBabel, Alejandro González IñarrituCourse Reader:A course reader that includes short stories, poetry, essays and criticism by Goethe, Marx, Borges, Dereck Walcott, Alejo Carpentier, George Lamming, Gayatri Spivak and David Damrosch will be available to be purchased the first day of class at Metro Publishers, 2440 Bancroft Way, (510) 644-1999. Course Catalog Number:

J. DeAngelis & B. RubergIn this class, we will consider texts that present ‘re-visions’ of earlier texts through adaptation and intertextuality.  What new critical perspectives emerge when all or part of a narrative is redistributed in a different context?  How do factors such as a change in genre, a change in historical or cultural context, or even a change in the gender of the author create a unique dialogue between earlier texts and later re-visions of them, and what critical purpose does this dialogue serve in each case?  For example, we will consider the relationship between Charles Perrault’s seventeenth-century fairy tales and Angela Carter’s postmodern feminist versions of them.  We will also consider Carter’s intertextual use of the violent pornography of the Marquis de Sade.  What do the genres of fairy tale and pornography have in common?  How do Carter’s re-visions develop interesting arguments about both?All of the main texts on the syllabus were written by female authors, and a majority of the pre-texts were written by male authors.  Questions concerning gender will therefore guide part of our inquiry into literary re-vision.  Women spent ages on the margins of the authorial literary landscape, though they were frequently the subjects of men’s stories.  In some traditions, the female body itself has been associated with rhetorical artifice, both frequently considered in need of regulation and control by men, as the male-authored texts on this syllabus will demonstrate.  How have female authors re-treated women through literary revision?  Specifically how have they re-treated the female body?  In what ways might revising texts written by males be seen as an assertion of women’s intellectual authority? (‘Author’ comes from the Latin auctor, a person who was once considered to possess auctoritas, or ‘authority.’)  What limits on such an assertion are posed by speaking from within the confines of previously written texts?With respect to the medieval and early modern texts on the syllabus, we will also consider how issues pertaining to textual criticism relate to the main questions guiding this class.  How is our modern conception of a ‘text’ altered by considering the fact that numerous medieval manuscripts and early modern printed editions offer different versions of the same story?  How did the simultaneous circulation of multiple versions of the same story inform medieval and early modern reading practices, and how do modern editors grapple with the ‘problem’ of multiple versions?  We will consider how these questions, seemingly unique to medieval and early modern textual matters, actually provide a basis upon which to formulate interesting questions about modern adaptation and intertextuality.We will explore the topics above through active class discussion, critical research, and intensive writing and essay revision.Main texts, with pre-texts in parentheses, include:Course Catalog Number: 17215

B. ClancyWhat do we mean when we use the word fiction? How does this term help us to understand the relationship between language and the world, as well as the role that literature might play in our lives? Beginning with texts in antiquity and the medieval period, this course will examine in depth the concept of fiction itself, and in particular the relationship between fictionality and the novel form, with an emphasis on novels written in the 20th-century. Here we will also consider the relationship between narrative and the representation of time, the relationship between fiction and truth, while examining historical shifts in the way in which the reader approaches narrative art epistemologically.

S. Scala Often when we think of urban fiction, we think of the relationship of the text to the outside, to the cityscape. In this course, we will move indoors and concentrate on the ways authors depict urban interiors and how these interior spaces interact with the outside cityscape. We will ask: What kinds of stories tend to take place in such interiors? Is there a specific literature of apartments? How can we articulate the relationship between interior and exterior in the urban text? Ultimately, we will consider what models of reading such a consideration of interior space affords us. In addition to our reading of texts that take place in cities, we will read Pride and Prejudice as an example of a text that takes place outside of the urban setting. The readings for this course will be either in the original French or in English translation.Austen: Pride and PrejudiceLa Fayette: La Princesse de ClèvesLaclos: Liaisons dangereusesBalzac: Le Cousin PonsRodoreda: The Time of the DovesDuras: La douleurIonesco: RhinocérosPerec: La Vie: mode d’emploiA reader with relevant theoretical and critical works including exerpts from Marcus’ Apartment Stories and Erich Auerbach’s “La Cour et la ville”Course Catalog Number:

P. Dimova & J. RaischThe magical power of transforming the self and the world has held a compelling sway over the literary imagination throughout the centuries.  In this course, we will look at the ways in which literature has reflected man’s fascination with magic as supernatural capacity to transfigure reality, as superstition, as verbal magic, as carnivalesque playfulness, and as Romantic imagination. We will read texts that take magic and divinities for granted, explain the world by means of metamorphosis and magic, read metamorphoses as historical allegories, and posit the human capacity for imagining as the ultimate magic. We will discuss novels, plays, poems, fairy tales, and essays across cultures and time that lend storytelling, love and death, art and history, words and ritual, dreams and nature the magic power of transformation. Finally, the literal or figurative metamorphoses that we will encounter in our readings will provoke us to inquire into notions such as identity, corporeality, power, censorship, and resistance.Since writing will be the main focus and concern of this course, we will address how our conceptions of magical narrative can play a role in our own critical writing, and we will try to introduce magic into our own narratives. Students will be encouraged to explore and combine different possibilities in analytical, comparative, and personal responses to the texts. We will focus on the process of academic writing through research, paper revision, editing, and class workshops to reconsider and build up student arguments.Tentative Reading List:Films:Course Reader: Poems by Charles Baudelaire, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Konstantin Pavlov.

Jennifer Lillie & Lynn XuThis course includes a wide-ranging selection of texts and films that each involve deconstructing what it means—and reconstructing what it doesn’t mean—to be a human being. We will consider how experimenting with different ideas of alternative humanities, whether by human integration with the decidedly (or not so decidedly) nonhuman or by exposure to extreme circumstances, serves to highlight and/or question prevailing values. Such speculation and experimentation allows these texts to demonstrate their political and philosophical relevance, in addition to giving us the opportunity to analyze how fiction functions as an expository mode of writing. Likewise, a heavy load of writing assignments will emphasize how to assume a critical (as opposed to a moral or purely aesthetic/affective) stance and how make a logically coherent literary argument. Readings include fantastic, science fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction and film, in addition to several articles of literary criticism and relevant non-fiction essays that will act as models for your own analysis and research.Readings: Stanislaw Lem, Solaris, Ursula K.

P. Dimova & K. Dickinson Considered a non-representational art medium, music poses a challenge for artistic representation: how can music be expressed in literature or explained by philosophy? How can music depict or narrate, and how can we make sense of music if it does not convey precise images or does not tell articulate stories? And, finally, how can literature render the subtle nuanced affects that music delineates? Music has captured the literary imagination over the centuries, and writers, poets, and philosophers have tried to recreate its essence in words. Enchanting, transfiguring, transcending death, destructive, dangerously contagious, moving to tears, or unveiling the deepest recesses of the soul, music has reigned supreme among the arts with its unconquerable, uncontrollable power. In this course, we will read lyric poetry, novels, and philosophical texts informed by music thematically and structurally. Furthermore, we will listen to Romantic songs and operas and examine literature and music, as they attempt to capture and evoke the expressive modes of the other art. We will discuss literary music in its capacity to affect, infect, or transform the characters or the poetic subjects; to transport them to the world beyond, from life to death, and form death to life; and to create a psychological space where emotions, desires, and affects proliferate in their non-verbal precarious or sensuous ambiguity.While writing, presenting, and actively participating in discussions on various aspects of the literary-musical interface, students will improve their analytical reading skills, conceptual and critical thinking, and expository writing and style. Students will be required to submit a diagnostic essay and several essays of progressive length. Two of the essays will be extensively revised; the final paper will have a substantial research component.Tentative Reading List:Mann, Thomas, Doctor FaustusPushkin, Alexander, Eugene OneginRilke, Rainer Maria, Sonnets to OrpheusShakespeare, William, Midsummer Night’s DreamTolstoy, Leo, The Kreutzer SonataWilde, Oscar, SaloméCourse Reader: selections from Homer’s Odyssey and Ovid’s Metamorphosis; philosophical texts by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Adorno; lyric poetry by Celan, Goethe, Keats, Mandelshtam, Pushkin, and Rilke; shorter prose works by E.T.A.

Do they suffer from an idealism that outweighs that of their
male counterparts? When women become superheroes, what remains of their femininity? To what extent is superpower masculinized?  Deified? Do super-heroines break through the stereotypical virgin/whore dichotomy? How do superpowers affect traditional roles of motherhood and marriage?

Alvin HenryHe that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.Sigmund Freud, Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria“Nothing exists outside us except a state of mind . . . a desire for solace, for relief, for something outside these miserable pigmies, these feeble, these ugly, these craven men and women.”Virginia Woolf, Mrs. DallowayIn this reading and research writing composition course, we will examine the questions of “how and why have literary artists transformed representations of consciousness across time and place” and “what critiques do these artists make by shifting the forms of their art?” We will begin our conversation in Renaissance England where everyone worried over who would succeed Queen Elizabeth—and if a bloody war would be required to instate the new monarch. William Shakespeare captures this social anxiety in his comedy Measure for Measure. Our task includes interpreting why Shakespeare would write about fear and confusion in a comedy rather than another form, say the seemingly more obvious choice of tragedy. Hopefully by digging into the dirty little secrets of the play, we can come up with some fun ideas. As our tools, we will explore these questions and the larger course questions by performing close readings: paying attention to grammar, parts of speech, word choice, and a host of literary devices. We will continue our readings by covering more literary genres include poetry, the novel, the short story, and an encounter with psychoanalysis.In addition to answering and challenging the course themes, we will foster your academic reading and writing skills. We will learn how to perform a critical analysis and close reading of a text along with mastering a variety of rhetorical strategies in order for you to craft a research essay.

S. England & S SchneiderIraq’s history is often told as a series of endings. After the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 C.E., survivors reported that the Tigris River ran ‘red with blood and black with ink.’ Arab historians extolled the grandeur of Baghdad’s architecture, as well as the city’s royal and private libraries, largely destroyed during the siege. The Mongol invasion put an end to five centuries of the Abbasid empire, during which time Iraq had become the economic and intellectual capital of the Middle East.The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent looting of the Baghdad Museum and national archives, was another ending of sorts. Although Baghdad had long ago lost its lofty architectural distinction, its reserves of artifacts and manuscripts made up perhaps the world’s longest-running local archive of ancient, medieval, and modern civilization. What is—or was—that space, in particular from a literary standpoint? The object of this course is a critical and historical discussion of literature in Iraq. Our readings will include Iraqi Arabic poetry and prose (in English translation), literature about Iraq by visitors, as well as films. A key premise of this course is that the literature we will read is inseparable from its social and political environment. For that reason, much of the fiction and poetry we read will accompany historical texts and commentaries. Throughout the course, we will probe ideas of nationality, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism as they pertain to modern Iraq.

His plays depict the psychological, political, economic, and social upheavals that mark the transition from the pre-modern world to a world that is recognizably our own. But he is also the most international of all writers. This course will explore Shakespeare’s extraordinary literary originality by studying his most influential plays in an international context. We will locate Shakespeare in the culture of his period by reading his plays in dialogue with masterworks from across Renaissance Europe. We will consider how he and his contemporaries engage with issues of international scope at a time (like our own) of extraordinary political, religious, and economic turmoil. We will read eight major plays by Shakespeare, as well as works by Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Cervantes, Erasmus, and Petrarch. This course thus offers an introduction to early modern Europe, an exercise in reading literature in an international context, and an in-depth study of a major author.Reading List:Shakespeare-Plays

In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party sometime, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.”In this class we will read a number of “classic” poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types, and students will encouraged to find other poems for the group to read.Students will be required to memorize and recite between 50 and 75 lines of poetry throughout the semester. In addition, students will prepare a short anthology of their favorite poems, with an explanatory introduction for each poem.Course Catalog Number: 17287

N. CleaverWe tend to think of epic as long and serious, full of noble characters at war with vengeful gods and impossible monsters. It takes place in a “masculine” world, glorifying great men engaged in lofty battles. The subject matter is weighty, following the fate of a single hero who ensures the triumph of a chosen people by destroying all obstacles, human, divine, or monstrous, that stand in the way of that nationalistic destiny.In this course we will question this conventional view of epic. What makes an epic an epic? Can this genre be defined coherently? What do we do with epics that do not fit all or even part of this description? After a brief historical overview of the epic tradition of western Europe, we will read four major epics from four different national traditions in their entirety: Lucan’s Pharsalia, Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, Rabelais’s Gargantua, and Milton’s Paradise Lost.While these are major texts of the epic tradition, in many ways they violate the rules of the genre. What do we make of Lucan’s mutilated bodies as a metaphor for a state ripped apart by its own desire for empire? Where do we place Rabelais’s obscene, extravagant giants and parodies of noble genealogies? What of Ariosto’s women warriors and Satan as the epic hero of Paradise Lost? Do we still consider them epics? How do these disparities affect our ability to define genre? Required Texts: Lucan, The PharsaliaAriosto, The Orlando FuriosoRabelais, GargantuaMilton, Paradise LostAristotle, The PoeticsCritical and Secondary Readings(Selections from these texts will be available in a reader and on the course bSpace site.)Durling, The Figure of the Poet in the Renaissance EpicGiamatti, Earthly Paradise and the Renaissance EpicGreene, The Light in TroyLukács, The Theory of the Novel Quint, Epic and EmpireZatti, The Quest for EpicCourse Catalog Number:

H. Freed-ThallIn this course, we will read some of the most experimental and adventurous literature of the 20th century. Instead of understanding texts as mirrors of social reality, we will consider them as laboratories—spaces for testing out, working through, or mixing up new ideas, categories, and ways of seeing and feeling. We will pay special attention to 20th-century international avant-garde movements, including Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and we will explore the relation of the literary avant-garde to the avant-garde in painting, cinema, and music. Some of the experimental texts we will read engage specific scientific and philosophical theories, including Freud’s theory of the unconscious, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of perception, and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Throughout the semester, we will be particularly attentive to the politics of literary form, the intimate relation between mass culture and the avant-garde, and the ways in which aesthetic experimentation manipulates perceptions of time and space.A course reader will include theoretical writings, short fiction, poetry, and manifestos by a variety of authors, including Marinetti, Apollinaire, Breton, Bataille, Leiris, Césaire, Proust, Kafka, Beckett, Borges, Ellison, Perec, Saussure, Freud, Benjamin, Shklovsky, Merleau-Ponty, Scarry, and Bürger.We will also read 5 or 6 novels. Please do not buy them until the first day of class, as the list is subject to revision. Students with a command of Spanish and/or French are encouraged to read in the original language.Aragon, Paris PeasantWoolf, To the LighthouseFaulkner, As I Lay DyingPuig, Kiss of the Spider WomanToussaint, MonsieurChamoiseau, School DaysCourse Catalog Number:

Six hundred persons, mostly widows and orphans, driven from their homes, hunted into the mountains like wild beasts, and living upon the herbs, grass and what they could pick up about the rocks….. I spent the day giving billets to the poor who came in from the surrounding mountains, where they lodge in holes and caverns, and who hearing of the distribution had come down for their share, and to eat bread the first time perhaps for months….” (Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe, Editedby Laura E.

M. A. BernsteinAlthough we will be focusing primarily on James Joyce’s Ulysses, the archetypal modernist prose masterpiece, our real subject could be named more aptly, Modernism’s Epic Ambitions.  By reading Ulysses together as our proof-text, we will be able to explore a set of issues, both historical and theoretical, that are constituitive of high modernism, but whose specific family resemblance will only emerge as our discussion itself unfolds. Close attention will be paid to the ways in which other modernist artists, alongside Joyce, experimented with technical issues of form and structure, as well as with innovative uses of new thematic materials.Regular and active in class participation and a willingness to engage in copious reading are the principal prerequisites for the course.Course Catalog Number: 17317

P. BritoThis class is about texts that want to take in entire worlds. It’s about stories, novels, and poems that aspire to the comprehensiveness of encyclopedias. This ambition gives them a strange, hybrid quality: the way that they catalog and communicate vast quantities of information often makes them seem more like non-literary texts than what we traditionally think of as literature. They will allow us to think about the often-complicated relationship between fiction and non-fiction, to consider the many ways in which texts connect both to the “real world” and to one another, and to reflect on what it means to read literature at a time when seemingly everything worth knowing is instantly available on the Internet.First and foremost, however, this is a writing course. It will be focused on the process of writing–on the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader. Texts will include:–The Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges –Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace–The Rings of Saturn by W.G. Sebald–The Wasteland by T.S. Eliot–Sans Soleil by Chris MarkerThe course reader will feature selections from the work of François Rabelais, Herman Melville, Gertrude Stein, Thomas Pynchon, and Helen DeWitt; short fiction by Vladimir Nabokov, Donald Barthelme, Italo Calvino, Roberto Bolaño, Lydia Davis, and Charles Stross; and poetry by Marianne Moore, César Vallejo, Bertolt Brecht, Pablo Neruda, Elizabeth Bishop, and Anne Carson.Course Catalog Number:

L. Wagner In this course, we will consider a range of texts that challenge us to engage critically with the act of reading itself.  From unreliable narrators to mystified characters, from wordplay to narrative holes, from histories of trauma to postmodern detective stories, these texts complicate and frustrate our initial attempts at interpretation.  And yet it is through their gaps, silences, and ambiguities that these works retrain their readers in the art of reading, forcing us to pay close attention not only to their meaning, but also to the manner in which they create (or obscure) this meaning.  As we interrogate the very process of reading, we will seek to develop a careful and critical stance not only as readers of fiction but also as writers of our own analytical prose. Texts and films will be chosen from among the following:The Marquise of O—, Heinrich von KleistThe Unknown Masterpiece, Honoré de BalzacBeloved, Toni MorrisonThe Crying of Lot 49, Thomas PynchonAtonement, Ian McEwanRope, Alfred HitchcockThe Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer A course reader will include excerpts from Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, short stories such as “The Vane Sisters” by Vladimir Nabokov, “The Figure in the Carpet” by Henry James, and “Eckbert the Fair” by Ludwig Tieck, and poetry such as “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer” by John Keats. Course Catalog Number:

K. CohenIn this course we will explore the relation between globalization and literary representation, asking how literary works come to imagine colonial encounters and the expansion of capitalism. We will explore several key aspects of globalization – colonization, consumerism, ethnicity, and images of totality – through novels, films, travel narratives, and critical essays. Through these texts, we will try to asses not only how works of literature and expository texts think of globalization but also what are the limits of such attempts at giving a figure to systems and totalities.Assignments will include: short analytical responses and other writing assignments; occasional responses to other students’ work; 2 short papers engaging texts studied in class and one longer paper. All papers will require a first draft and a revisionCourse ReaderThe course reader will include articles of and excerpts from: Stuart Hall, Fredric Jameson, Naomi Klein, Montesquieu, Michel de Montaigne, Immanuel Wallerstein, and others.

J. RaischIn this course, we will be examining a number of texts that tell the story of being lost: at sea, in labyrinths, in time. In thinking about how being lost functions as mode of story-telling, we will necessarily spend time also thinking about travel narratives and the genre of fantasy. What is it about “the wrong-turn” or “the shipwreck” that so captures our imagination? How does going the wrong way allow us construct other worlds and better understand our own? Beginning with the prototypal journey of Homer’s Odysseus, we will trace lost travelers from Lemuel Gulliver to Dorothy and Toto to the ensemble cast of J. J. Abram’s influential television show. Texts will include the following novels and short stories:Homer, The OdysseyShakespeare, The TempestJonathan Swift, Gulliver’s TravelsFerenc Karinthy, MetropoleJorge Luis Borges, The Garden of Forking Paths and The ImmortalPenelope Fitzgerald, OffshoreVictor Flemming, Wizard of OzHayao Miyazaki, Spirited AwayTelevision episodes of LostCourse Catalog Number:

R. Lorenz & J. NelsenIn this course, we will read stories of people seduced away from a well-balanced life by the allures of beauty, art, revenge, sex, sentiment—or even by rational thought pushed to extremes. Although we could label these characters as mentally ill, many of the texts we will read portray their deviance as an ambiguous sort of exaltation. Accordingly, we will analyze how each text presents the terrible costs of losing grip, as well as how the characters, from the point of view of their extreme principles, offer a twisted justification for the unbalanced life.These texts will offer stimulating material for the primary aim of the course, which is to teach you how to write convincing essays filled with intelligent analysis and argument. A considerable amount of class time will thus be devoted explicitly to writing instruction, so that you can exit the course with some well-honed and very useful practical skills.

D. Inciarte & I. PopescuThe Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read sections from Raman Selden’s, A Reader’s Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory, which will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.Please buy the editions specifically ordered for this class.Course ReadingPlato, Symposium ISBN 0-14-044024-0Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel, selected chaps from Book 1 ISBN 0-14-044-047Cervantes, Don Quixote, 1st five chapters, 0-06-093434-4Nabokov, Pale Fire, 0-425-03784-3Shakespeare, As you Like It 0-451-52678-3Bernhard, Old Masters 0-226-04391-6Strunk & White, Elements of Style 0-205-31342-6 In reader: Selections from Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Franz Kafka, Donne, Lucretius, Clément Marot, James Joyce, Alice Munro, Shirley Jackson, Mary Oliver, Wislawa SzymborskaMovies: Dancer in the DarkCourse Catalog Number:

If, as Husserl argued, one must “get back to the things themselves, we will attempt instead to go forward to ourselves as things by considering the function of the body in marginalized literatures.

C. Piser & K. KadueIn this course we’ll study the connections between multilingualism, multiculturalism, and marginalized communities in literature. We’ll look at different ways of storytelling to determine how narratives are structured formally and linguistically. We will read literature as a political tool for the assertion of a marginalized identity, and to this end, question the use of multilingualism in the representation of multicultural communities. We will look at space as well – both the space of identity formation, and the space of communities living on the margins, separated by race, culture, ethnicity, language, and class. We will read literature from a wide variety of cultural and linguistic traditions, and our discussions will be informed by critical readings.Our goal this semester will be to learn how to read, write, and talk about literature; ultimately, we will write research papers that take our literary analysis a step further. Completing all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participating in class are key components of discussion courses, and you should be prepared to do both.

Margarita Gordon (formerly: Zaydman)Stories usually spring from extraordinary circumstances, when the quiet hum of everyday life is disrupted by a climactic event.  Crisis, defined as a turning point, can take many forms, from the economic one currently plaguing our country to the psychological and physical crises we face in our personal lives.  In this class, we will explore by what means crises arise, what they look like, and how, if at all, they are managed.  These verbal, visual, and cinematic texts will lead us through the disasters of war, the vertiginous heights of romantic obsession, the shame of betraying one’s own ideals, and the challenges of self-understanding and self-formation.“Crisis” is also the root word for “critical.”  This class is designed to encourage critical thinking, an attention not just to what a text might be saying but to how it goes about saying it, what linguistic or visual devices it draws upon.  You will learn to read attentively, write analytically, and participate actively and creatively in class discussion.Readings will be chosen from the following:Joseph Conrad, Lord Jim

B. RubergMonsters come in many forms: furry and clawed, grotesque and menacing, mysterious, dangerous, unclassifiable, sometimes surprisingly human. Every society constructs its own monsters, and so does every piece of literature. Here, we’ll question what makes a creature a monster in the first place: an unusual body, violence behavior, unacceptable passions? With an emphasis on queer and feminine monstrosity, this course explores the “wild” while emphasizing reading, writing, and critical thinking skills.Main TextsWhere the Wild Things Are, Maurice Sendak

D. Inciarte & K. Kadue The Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read sections from Raman Selden’s, A Reader’s Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory, which will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.Please buy the editions specifically ordered for this class.Course ReadingPlato, Symposium ISBN 0-14-044024-0Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel, selected chaps from Book 1 ISBN 0-14-044-047Cervantes, Don Quixote, 1st five chapters, 0-06-093434-4Nabokov, Pale Fire, 0-425-03784-3Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice (any edition)Bernhard, Old Masters 0-226-04391-6Calvino, If on a Winter’s Night a TravelerStrunk & White, Elements of Style 0-205-31342-6 In reader: Selections from Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Franz Kafka, Lucretius, Clément Marot, Shakespeare (sonnets), Shirley Jackson, Mary Oliver, Wislawa SzymborskaMovies: Dancer in the Dark SyllabusCourse Catalog Number:

T. Wolff & J. GreenwaldThis course experiments with different approaches to close reading through the diversions and subversions of comedy. We will get used to treating the forms of wordplay that provide most jokes with their punchlines as corresponding to aspects of literary style, from ambiguity to anticlimax, from clashing registers to the much-maligned pun. We will also look for ways that the same slipperiness of meaning plays a role in our own everyday speech habits, and in the media that saturate our social formation and participation. The course theme is intended primarily to attune the undergraduate reader and writer to fine stylistic distinctions in literary texts, but also secondarily to reveal, and to offer descriptive terms for, the ways language plays games in our lives at large (a central topic throughout will be problems of translation and communication). For this reason we will read particularly with an eye out for the ways language and comedy structure and reconfigure broader social themes, from gender and sexual politics, to childhood and family psychology, to the establishment of cultural and legal norms. The course balances texts from a range of genres and media (including film, television and advertising) with critical texts that suggest the unexpected force of play and the “comic attitude” in and out of literature. As always, students should be aware that an R/C course is especially writing-intensive, but in this course an additional willingness to pause over, discuss and play with linguistic details is a must. Readings will be chosen from the following:Aristophanes, LysistrataWilliam Shakespeare, As You Like It, selected SonnetsHonoré de Balzac, “The Girl with the Golden Eye” or “Sarrasine”Emily Dickinson, selected poemsLewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland (& Through the Looking Glass, “The Hunting of the Snark”)Gerard Manly Hopkins, selected poemsEdward Lear, selected poemsOscar Wilde, The Importance of Being ErnestDonald Barthelme, selected storiesHarryette Mullen, Muse & DrudgeGeorges Perec, from Life: A User’s Manual (and further Oulipo excerpts)Marx Brothers, Duck Soupselected episodes of Arrested DevelopmentFriedrich Schiller, Letters on the Aesthetic Education of ManFriedrich Schlegel, from Athenaeum FragmentsJohan Huizinga, from Homo LudensSigmund Freud, from The Psychopathology of Everyday LifeD.

T. Singleton & T. LuuThis course will follow the body in literature by looking at texts that deal with physical, religious, social, cultural and psychological transformations. How do our bodies experience and perform changes within and outside of ourselves? Are bodily performances representations or products of change? We will examine texts from the early and late classical periods and follow the theme of bodily and mental change reaching into the late 20th century. If, as Husserl argued, one must “get back to the things themselves, we will attempt instead to go forward to ourselves as things by considering the function of the body in marginalized literatures.

Harsha Ram Course Description: What is a hero? What are the origins of the hero as a cultural and literary construct? Originating in myth, the folktale and religious cult-worship, the hero is also present in most literary genres as a central protagonist who acts or is acted upon, and around whom the plot generally revolves. Literary genres determine the kind of heroes that arise, their internal traits and their mode of being in and acting upon the world. This semester we will be examining various types of heroes as they relate to their fictional worlds and to the genres they inhabit: the mythic hero, the tragic hero, the epic hero, the hero of romance, and variants of the romantic hero such as the Gothic and the Byronic. We will be reading extensive literary criticism and some literary and philosophical theory, from Joseph Campbell and Northrop Frye to Hegel, Kojève, and Bakhtin. We will be examining different approaches to literary texts, from traditional historical philology to structuralism, philosophical criticism, and feminism. The course can also be read as a survey of certain aspects of the Western tradition from ancient Greek myth and tragedy, via Milton’s epic, down to nineteenth-century British and Russian romanticism. Throughout the semester we will be following on the heels of the hero Prometheus – rebel and trickster, the stealer of fire and mentor to the human race. Prometheus is the prototypical hero, embodying the collision between human creativity and freedom and the constraints of a social or divine order. He has surfaced at different moments in Western history, from archaic Greece to Athenian democracy to modern Europe in the wake of the French Revolution. The crisis of the Promethean hero delineated by the European romantics allows us to ask what kind of hero – or antihero – is still possible in modern literature.SyllabusBooks to be purchased at the Student Bookstore:Hesiod, Theogony, trans.

Enrique LimaThe Hungarian Marxist thinker Georg Lukács argues in his influential The Theory of the Novel (1920) that the outward form of the novel is essentially biographical. That is, the novel explores a problem symbolized by the story of a character’s life.  Ian Watt, a thinker of a very different political and aesthetic temperament than Lukács, says in his equally seminal The Rise of the Novel (1957) that novels are obligated to convince their readers of the individuality of their characters. Most theorists and historians of the novel would concur with Lukács and Watt on the centrality of the individual to the development of the novel. But what if a novel orders its narrative universe with something other than a central figure whose experiences provide the organic limits to the story? What if in complicating the seeming naturalness of the biographical form a novel manages to perform a critique of the historical association between the “rise” of the novel as a literary mode and the universalization of the discourses of the individual that sustained the emergence and global spread of capitalist modernity? This course addresses these questions through careful readings of British, U.S., and Latin American novels. We will also read significant theoretical works on the novel.Possible readings include: William Faulkner Absalom, Absalom!, José María Arguedas Yawar Fiesta, Georg Lukács The Theory of the Novel, Nancy Armstrong How Novels Think, Alex Woloch The One vs. the Many, and Charles Taylor Sources of the Self.Course Catalog Number:

Professor B. SpackmanThis course will examine a selection of travel narratives within the context of contemporary postcolonial theory and “mobility studies.”  Throughout the course, we will be acquainting ourselves with recent theoretical work on travel, Orientalism, and tourism.  Readings of primary texts will begin with a glance backward to Marco Polo’s thirteenth-century account of his travels to the East and Columbus’s account of what he thought was his voyage to the East, as well the early modern accounts of the voyages of discovery by Bartolome de Las Casas and Jean de Léry. We will then shift to a selection of modern travel narratives, both fictional and non-fictional.  Questions to be addressed include: the relation between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.   How does travel contribute to the construction of a place called “home,” and how might it disrupt that construction? What happens to Orientalist discourse when the Orientalist who enters and exits the harem happens to be a woman? What fantasy compels Europeans to find “cannibalism” in the East and the New World, over and over again? Authors read will include Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Bartolome de Las Casas, Jean de Léry, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Mark Twain, Xavier de Maistre, and Italo Calvino.  We will also read theoretical work by Said, Greenblatt, Culler, Kaplan, Pratt, Hulme, and others.Course Catalog Number:

N. LargierEuropean cultures of the 16th and 17th centuries have been obsessed with the power of images and imagination, of figures and figuration. Poetic practices of mirroring, linking, and folding are at the center of this culture of the imagination that in recent years has often been compared to forms in which images and texts are used in cyberspace. The seminar will deal with this topic from different angles. First, we will discuss rhetorical theories of the power of images and some theoretical approaches to baroque literature. Then we will analyze texts and images from the early modern period, especially visionary texts, baroque theater, poetry, and the art of emblems. Based on this and on the individual projects of the participants, we will investigate analogous structures of the uses of images and texts in cyberspace. This will include the question of how pre-enlightenment uses of images might help to understand postmodern imagination and the production of virtual worlds.Course Catalog Number:

Professor V. KahnThe history of Western literary theory is often told in terms of the concept of mimesis. But there is another, equally powerful, anti-mimetic strand to this history, and that is the critique of mimesis as a form of idolatry. In this course, we will explore this critique from the prohibition against images in the Hebrew bible up through modern attacks on mimesis as inherently ideological. Our main literary texts will be taken from Plato, the Hebrew Bible, Tertullian and Reformation England (especially Marlowe, Bacon, and Milton), when there was a fierce debate about the harmful power of images and the necessity of iconoclasm. But we will also discuss the afterlife of iconoclasm in Kant, Marx, Freud, Benjamin, Baudrillard, and Althusser . Students whose interests lie primarily in other national literatures are welcome, and may write their final papers on primary texts not discussed in class, though they must engage the theoretical texts assigned for the seminar.Course Catalog Number:

(This is a room-share with German 268.   Professor Teng notes that Students should be able to read German. However, the texts will be also available in English, so those students not as proficient in German may also take the course. French is not required, the French texts will be in translation.)In recent years, both literary studies and philosophy have taken great interest in tragedy, a literary genre usually considered the highest and – since German idealism – the most philosophical in the generic hierarchy. Against the background of recent literary scholarship and critical theory, this seminar examines the development of tragedy from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. Concerned with the irresolvable conflicts in ethical life, tragedy in this period registers the vicissitudes of European modernity by means of ever evolving poetic and aesthetic programs. The seminar will try to map three interrelated domains: Poetics of tragedy from Aristotle through French classicism and German classicism to formal innovations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; philosophy of the tragic from German idealism (Hoelderlin, Hegel) through cultural theories around 1900 (Nietzsche, Simmel, Benjamin) to contemporary critical theory (Adorno, Menke, Cavell); main issues of the modern age as reflected in the key works of the tragic genre such as sovereignty (French classicism and the baroque Trauerspiel), moral and legal order (Diderot, Lessing, Goethe, Ibsen), exigency of history (from Schiller to Heiner Mueller), and crisis of selfhood (expressionism).

FrancoisA comparative course exploring the intersections of literature, psychoanalysis, queer studies, and environmental studies.Popular environmentalist discourse is often portrayed as the province of misanthropes, lonely-hearts and “kill-joys,” whose “downer” ethics can only be articulated in the negative—as the demand to curb and curtail hedonistic consumption.     »  read more  »Course Catalog Number:

Andrea Gadberry & Jocelyn Saidenberg“The way down to hell is easy…” – Virgil, Aeneid 6.126“Does the Eagle know what is in the pit?” – William Blake, The Book of ThelThis semester we will plunge into the abyss, taking our cue from many distinguished literary trailblazers as we study critical reading and composition.  Since antiquity, epic heroes have gone to hell (or Hades) and back: Odysseus goes to the underworld, Aeneas follows his example, and Dante heads to hell, and, more recently, Alice Notley’s Alette descends into subterranean New York, to name just a few examples. This course takes katabasis, or the descent to the underworld, as its point of departure for its study of descents into depths literal and figurative.  In poems, novels, plays, and works of art, we will study the spelunkings of heroes epic and otherwise into abysses below and within.  We will explore the encounter between life and death that katabasis dramatizes, and we will ask what sort of knowledge an abyss might offer – or what kind of “gazing” an abyss might be able to do.  What is the relationship between the underworld and the world above, and how does the experience of descent shape the return (for those who do return)?  What are the qualities of the protagonists who plumb these depths?  How might a literary investigation of the deepest fathoms help us understand the forms of the unfathomable?We will also apply the attentive gaze we cast into the abyss to the art of writing.  Over a series of short essays and slightly longer papers, students will practice expository writing and close reading, studying the craft of producing argumentative essays sustained by careful readings.  In addition to these written assignments, students should expect to participate actively in class discussions and make an oral presentation.

According to the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, we live in “the best of all possible worlds.”  Whether or not that’s true, it hasn’t prevented us from ceaselessly imagining – or even creating – alternate realities: shiny fantasy worlds where our most cherished dreams come true or, when we’re feeling less optimistic, nightmarish dystopias where they are mercilessly crushed.  What constitutes a possible world or parallel universe?    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number:

Margaret Gordon & Keith BudnerThis is a course about people who fall short, plans that go bust, and stories that don’t turn out like you thought they would. Not that you’ll be spending the semester suffering through a series of tragic disappointments. For as we explore the making and unmaking of lofty ambitions, romantic aspirations, prophecies, and personal and collective ideals, we will also be questioning whether they’re all they’re cracked up to be, or even worth pursuing in the first place. Where do these enthralling, often crushing expectations come from? In what way do they shape our attitudes towards the past, the present, and the future? How are they framed within artistic works? With what preconceptions do we approach these works, and how might the works respond to them? Whether as characters, narratives, or readers, could going halfway, amiss, in the opposite direction, or nowhere at all towards fulfilling expectations—going somewhere completely unexpected—bring its own rewards?A significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing and revising three papers as well as completing a number of short writing assignments. You will also create and present a multimedia group project. Please purchase the following texts in the editions specified:William Shakespeare, King Lear (Penguin; ISBN 978-0140714760)Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot (Grove; ISBN 978-0802130341)Nathanael West, Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust (New Directions; ISBN 978-0811218221)Shorter written texts, films, songs, and visual art may include:The Bible, selectionsVirgil, from The Aeniad Apuleius, from The Golden AssMiguel de Cervantes, from Don QuixoteKatherine Mansfield, “The Baron”Jorge Luis Borges, “The Library of Babel”Henry James, “The Beast in the Jungle”James Joyce, “Araby”Roberto Bolaño, “Gómez Palacio”Elizabeth Bishop, from Questions of TravelFranco Marinetti, The Futurist ManifestoVladimir Mayakovsky, “At the Top of My Voice”Leonard Cohen, “Waiting for the Miracle” and “The Future”Hieronymus Bosch, The Last JudgmentGregory Crewdson, Beneath the RosesTex Avery, selected cartoonsElia Kazan, On the WaterfrontLars von Trier, MelancholiaJohn Huston, The Maltese FalconAndrei Tarkovsky, StalkerFritz Lang, MetropolisCourse Catalog Number: 17209

Gabe Page & Caitlin SchollThis is a course about the pleasure particular to reading and reflecting on literary texts, especially those short narrative texts known as tales. It is about learning to become the kind of reader capable of being seduced by a literary text: by its language, plot, sheer inventiveness – even by its ambiguity. This course will also serve as an introduction to world literature. We will read tales from around the world and across the ages: folk tales, epic tales, strange and fantastic tales, metaphysical parables, travel tales, tales of crime and detection, the realist short story, and postmodern metafictional narratives. We will discuss the differences between oral tales and written tales, and the ways in which oral structures are presented in many of the literary texts we will be reading. This is also a writing intensive course; while not everyone immediately associates writing with pleasure, we will approach writing as an activity of experimentation and discovery – never easy, sometimes frustrating, but truly exhilarating when we finally find the language to give form to our experience of a literary text, enabling us to communicate that experience to others.Readings are likely to include selections from The Odyssey, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Chuang Tzu, A Thousand and One Nights, the Ramayana, The Decameron, various Romantic narrative poems, the Sunjata and Mwindo epics, short stories by Poe, Gogol, Diop, Borges, and Calvino, Kafka’s parables, Chamoiseau’s Solibo Magnificent, and Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard. We will complement our literary readings with theoretical essays by Vladimir Propp, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Peter Brooks, Walter Ong, and others.Course Catalog Number:

Sydney Cochran and Diana ThowIn this course we will consider madness in its many forms and characterizations in literature, film, and visual art.  Our study, however, will not be of madness itself so much as the way it exemplifies the close connection, for all of us, between what we see and the imaginative lens through which we see it.We will meet Don Quixote who, pathetic or profound, sees a world that is precisely as romantic as he wishes it to be, and a Little Prince who knows for certain, when looking at a sketch of a wooden box with holes, that inside that box is a live sheep. We’ll listen to the townspeople, in “The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World,” as they re-imagine the village they thought they knew in the course of telling to each other the likely story of the dead body that washes up one day on their beach.  We will watch as the narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper” encounters successive new versions of herself in the paper that covers her room.As we examine the texts before us, we will consider how the process of reading fiction and of viewing art is also an exercise of the imagination: the worlds and characters we “see” before us are worlds and characters we ourselves, in part, create.  What does it mean to read?  What is the place and the process of interpretation?  And how do our interpretations of art impact the world we encounter and the self we create when we leave the classroom?  Is reading any less a process of intellectual creation than the one of writing: that exercise by which we give form and shape to our interpretations—represent and communicate to others what we see in the art we analyze?This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, interpretation, and research.WRITTEN TEXTS:FILMS:Course Catalog Number:

Paco Brito & Marianne KaletskySome texts have the ability to confound us. A hole in the plot, an unresolved ending, a word that feels wrong: these moments of ambiguity can frustrate our attempts to pin down what a text is really saying. But such riddles can also spark our curiosity and deepen our understanding of how literature works.Each of the texts we’re reading presents an insoluble mystery. In some, we can’t distinguish between fantasy and reality. Others challenge our moral intuitions. And some revel in the obscurity of a crucial word, event, or character. These texts are ideally suited for close reading and careful interpretation. The central focus of the class will be to help students write analytical essays in response to the texts. Texts will include:Novels:The Kingdom of this World by Alejo CarpentierThe Turn of the Screw by Henry JamesBeloved by Toni MorrisonFilms:Do the Right Thing by Spike LeeMulholland Drive by David LynchSolaris by Andrei TarkovskyDrama:A Midsummer Night’s Dream by William ShakespearePoetry by A.

Jessie HockCourse Description: In The Republic, Plato condemps poetry for being too far removed from reality. A feeble imitation of the world (itself an imitation of ideal Ideas), poetry isn’t “true,” distorting human understanding of the world influence on young people to behave badly. In the Poetics, Aristotle argues that didactic, or scientific, verse isn’t really poetry. From the Greeks onwards, we have tended to distinguish poetry and science as different modes of thought with different relationships to truth or the real, and different functions in society. This course will take a long view of this troubled history and read classic scientific writings, poetry, and poetic theory to question the traditional generic boundaries between scientific and literary texts and practices. From the farming manual that is Virgil’s Georgics to contemporary scholarship that uses neurological advances to analyze literature to science fiction from all periods, we will question the boundaries between science and literature and the practice of each.

Course Description:Contemporary debates about cultural matters often appeal to nature to decide them. Parties debating a cultural issue will attempt a familiar gesture: each will claim that its position is natural and therefore true. What relationship between society and nature does this appeal assume?  Why is nature seen as factually accurate or true?  Why would an appeal to nature decide a cultural issue?Reading literary and theoretical works from different cultures and historical moments, we will identify and compare the multiplicity of “natures” that have been generated in these different contexts.  By continuation, we will explore the implications of different modes of seeing the relationship between the culture and nature: as one of opposition, continuity, ambivalence, etc.Throughout our exploration of literature, nature, culture, you will think about the argumentative appropriation of nature in contemporary debates about gender, race, class, sexual orientation; development versus conservation; local versus global; old versus new; science versus religion; man versus animal; and individual versus collective.In addition to focusing on the ways in which nature and culture appear in the texts, we will also examine the role of fiction in shaping our cultural values and public policies with regards to nature. Why would one choose the written word as an approach to the natural world in the first place? What can literature as fiction do that other ways of thinking about nature cannot? Most urgently, what kind of solutions or insights can literature offer to address problems and tensions in the world beyond the written page?Throughout the semester, we will ask how reading about fictional worlds can be a means of better understanding our lived world: how do the situations and characters we encounter in the texts invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and decisions? In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument.Possible Reading List:Course Catalog Number:

Celine Piser & Oya ErezIn this course we’ll study the connections between multilingualism, multiculturalism, and marginalized communities in literature. We’ll look at different ways of storytelling to determine how narratives are structured formally and linguistically. We will read literature as a political tool for the assertion of a marginalized identity, and to this end, question the use of multilingualism in the representation of multicultural communities. We will look at space as well – both the space of identity formation, and the space of communities living on the margins, separated by race, culture, ethnicity, language, and class. We will read literature from a wide variety of cultural and linguistic traditions, and our discussions will be informed by critical readings.This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, and two analytical research papers. Primary Texts will be chosen from the following:The Old TestamentErez Biton, “Summary of a Conversation” and “Shopping Song on Dizengoff”Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, DicteeJunot Diaz, DrownMichel de Montaigne, “On Cannibals”Vladimir Nabokov, “The Seaport”Emine Sevgi Ozdamar, Mother TongueCynthia Ozick, “Envy, or Yiddish in America”Henry Roth, Call It SleepLeila Sebbar, SherazadeCourse Catalog Number:

Adeline Tran & Oya Erez“To look at a thing is not the same as seeing a thing.” – Oscar WildeTaking our cue from Wallace Stevens’ poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” we will be exploring how different ways of looking, seeing and observing are portrayed through narrative point of view in literature and film.  How does point of view shape, control and manipulate the narrative structure of a given text?  What is the difference between looking and seeing?  Is there a right and a wrong way of looking at something, or are there infinite ways of looking that are all equally valid? We’ve all heard the expression “I know it when I see it,” but is seeing the same thing as knowing?  Can the gaze be purely objective, or is it always (at least in part) subjective and biased?  In this course, we will take up these questions of the gaze through a comparison of various forms of narrative point of view, from the covert exchange of gazes in Princesse de Cleves, to the multiple shifts in perspective in To The Lighthouse, to the unreliable first-person narration in Lolita. In our discussion of narrative perspective in film, we will look at how point of view is presented visually through techniques such as camera shots, framing devices, and lighting.  Throughout the course, we will examine the relationship between ways of looking and ways of knowing, and ask ourselves whether seeing really is believing.  In addition, this class requires active student participation and places a strong emphasis on improving student writing skills through weekly worksheets, in-class workshops, and two formal papers.Required Texts:Madame de La Fayette, La Princesse de ClevesCaspary, LauraWoolf, To The LighthouseNabokov, LolitaSebald, AusterlitzFilms:Kurosawa, RashomonBergman, PersonaCourse Catalog Number:

Jeffrey WeinerDescribing, performing, and creating ecstatic experiences has been one of the great stumbling blocks in literature.  Whether it is a physical or a spiritual elevation beyond the norm, the ability to articulate the transcendent has challenged writers in terms of the forms that can be used to express the ecstatic; this obstacle has also, debatably, given rise to a huge release of creativity and the rise of new forms.  We will explore the very limits of human experience in theatre, fiction, scripture, opera, and lyric poetry.  Euripides describes what will be the ongoing tension between freedom to experience aggressive and extremely pleasurable states with a need for the order and restraint of communal living.  From the time of the ancients to the present, individuals and societies have negotiated the restrictions on the experience of ecstatic states, and new cultural forms have come to fruition at that border.  We will explore the explosive collision of destructive and creative manifestations in texts through a variety of genres from different historical periods, and with the cross-disciplinary curiosity that defines Comparative Literature.Euripides, The BacchaeBible, selections from Gospels, Isaiah and Acts of the ApostlesApuleius, MetamorphosesJohn of the Cross, The Dark Night of the SoulShakespeare, The Winter’s TaleShelley, Mont Blanc Wagner, The Twilight of the GodsKushner, Angels in America: PerestroikaAristotle, short selections from Poetics and RhetoricBurke, Edmund, A philosophical enquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautifulCicero, short selections from On the Ideal OratorFreud, selections from Civilization and its DiscontentsHepburn,  “Wonder”James, short selections from Varieties of Religious ExperienceLonginus, On the SublimeMatthew Wilson Smith, selections from The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to CyberspacePlato, selections from Phaedrus____, selections from IonCourse Catalog Number:

Trinh LuuThis is a reading and composition course that will introduce a broad selection of texts on war and its aftermath. The readings will explore premodern Vietnamese civil war, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam wars, and the Algerian civil war. The wide selection is based on the assumption that there is something universally comprehensible about the experience of war. And yet, by reading these texts closely, we will try to tease out the social and cultural specificities that mark these different articulations. The course will address questions like: How can we talk about the legacy of war and survival ethically? What is its representability? How can we confront the horrors analytically? How do we speak of the war dead without “consuming” them?

J. Lillie & M. Renolds“Style is the thing that’s always a bit phony, and at the same time you cannot write without style.” (Elizabeth Bowen, The Death of the Heart). This course operates on the premise that style is more than a “phony” necessity; in fact, it can also be a means of self-discovery, self-invention, and a fair amount of fun-having. It’s all too easy not to pay attention to what characterizes one’s writing, to passively reproduce assembly-line structures and nutritionally worthless truisms. This course aspires to help us break free of that. By learning to recognize and interpret the styles of other writers, we’ll uncover and develop aspects of our own, and prove that analytical and creative writing are not two mutually exclusive categories. In accordance with that premise, in this course our enemies will be the bland and rote, our friends the idiosyncratic and experimental. Creative and complex arguments will be made fearlessly at the expense of always being right. Grammar rules will be discussed, admired, and from time to time, firmly stepped on. Clichés (especially those that tend to plague writing about literature) will be hunted and used for taxidermy. As you play with your writing through mimicry and invention (on paper) and by analyzing works through a variety of media (including in-class performances), we hope you’ll learn as much about your written voice as about the texts at hand.Works for the reading and viewing lists were selected for their provocativeness (to encourage valuable debate), for the extent to which they reward close reading, and for overall degree of fun and weirdness (always good indicators of a work that takes its style seriously). In addition to being written in unique (and sometimes notorious) styles, many incorporate style as a theme of the narrative itself, in which liberties and trappings of the written language play a crucial role.Possible Readings:• Sei Shonagon, selections from The Pillow Book• Kawabata Yasunari, some Palm-of-the-Hand Stories• Murakami Haruki, “On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning,” “The Elephant Vanishes,” “The Zoo Attack”• Project Itoh, Harmony• Eileen Chang, “Lust, Caution”• Raymond Carver, “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” “Cathedral”• Lydia Davis, The End of the Story or selections from Break It Down• Jenny Erpenbeck, Visitation• Alexander Pushkin, Eugene Onegin• Italo Calvino, If on a winter’s night a traveler• James Joyce, “The Dead”• Edgar Allan Poe, “Ligeia,” “The Man of the Crowd”• H.

Kfir Cohen & Johnathan VakninIn this course we will develop writing and argumentative skills through exploring imaginative and theoretical texts that offer us models of alternatives worlds whose social structures attempt to solve some of the perennial problems of modern living. We will think through questions concerning the consequences of industrialization, gender relations, and the conditions needed to bring about a just society, among others. We will watch several contemporary films, and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on utopian fiction and sci-fi. We will consider some of the following questions: under what social conditions an “alternative world” becomes desirable? What do we mean by “world” and what might be its opposites? What role do literary form and genre have in constructing an alternative world? What kind of attitude do we adopt vis à vis such texts whose implicit or explicit aim is to be “more” than an imaginary experiment?Other than regular writing assignments, students will be asked to write a short piece elaborating an alternative world of their own.

This course will explore the interplay of drama and tedium in day-to-day life. All of the works we will read eschew a purely heroic or marvelous mode and instead focus on petty concerns or mundane experience. But these texts do so in a way that is far from ordinary or boring; each offers a distinct creative perspective on everyday life. Some of the works we’ll read highlight the intense and dramatic undercurrents of routine existence. For example, Virginia Woolf “tunnels” deep into the inner life of a middle-aged woman who views each day as a “dangerous” feat; Nikolai Gogol turns a bureaucrat’s quest for a new coat in a darkly humorous, overblown farce; and Emily Dickinson, although she hardly left her room, wrote poetry suffused with extremes of despair, exultation, passion, faith and doubt. Other texts take the opposite approach, underlining the contrast between our romantic dreams and the monotony of daily experience. Euripides, for example, will show us how a heroic quest deteriorates into bickering and jealousy; Platonov, one of the most remarkable writers of the Soviet era, portrays the tragic failure of utopian hopes; and Chekhov’s plays offer masterful depictions of lassitude and gradually fading ambition. As we read each text, we’ll discuss how it illuminates the intertwined monotony and intensity of everyday experience, but we’ll also move beyond the course topic to read each text for its own sake, paying attention to multiple prominent themes and motifs. We will also devote substantial class time to instruction in argumentative writing and research skills. As in all R&C courses, you will write several papers. The ultimate goal of the course is to develop your critical thinking and writing skills as well as your ability to enjoy the creative complexity of literary texts.Texts:Platonov, The Foundation PitWoolf, Mrs. DallowayChekhov, The SeagullGogol, “The Overcoat”Dickinson, selected poetryEuripides, MedeaCourse Catalog Number:

Kanayo AgbodikeThis course will consider a number of literary texts with an eye to how they explore themes of pathology at both the individual and collective levels. Literature frequently involves critical reflections on both characters within texts and the social contexts that shape them: Plays and novels often imagine personal crises, as well as responses to disruptions within familiar or established public orders; lyric poetry can express conflicts between self and society. We will be considering these and other examples of how various literary forms explore the conditions and implications of pathology, or deviation from what is considered “normal” or “healthy.” Does literature tend to reinforce such norms, question them, or some combination of the two? What specific forms and techniques do texts involve in their representations of pathology? What do cultural reflections on pathology reveal about contradictions within systems of normative values and practices? These are some of the questions that will shape our discussion of a series of relevant texts.This is a writing-intensive course. In addition to active in-class participation, coursework will include frequent short writing assignments and two longer essays.

Brian ClancyIn the opening section of his work Poetics, Aristotle moves from a brief discussion of means of representation to a focus on objects of representation that persists throughout his text. Although Aristotle’s theory of mimesis would be considered by many as a blueprint for fashioning narrative fiction through this focus on the objects and human actions that language allegedly refers to, this course examines how many 20th-century modernist literary projects appear at odds with Aristotle’s theory, while seeking to build narrative art on the basis of altogether new aesthetic premises. Moreover, the modernists viewed language as an aesthetic medium and oftentimes borrowed techniques from the visual arts in their exploration of narrative language’s many potential uses. This course thus seeks to fill the gap in narrative aesthetics set in motion by Aristotle’s theory of mimesis by studying the modernist literary techniques of the 1920’s that forever changed fiction despite the persistence of Aristotle’s ideas. As a way of critiquing Aristotle’s influential theory, this course grasps narrative language as an aesthetic medium in itself, not as a mode of representation that merely imitates action in the world. This course furthermore argues that narrative is not a host of symbols that stand for things we already know. In contrast, the epistemological function of narrative art (especially in the context of modernist literary experiments) is more complex and ambitious than often assumed. After looking at Aristotle’s Poetics, we will examine continental modernism to gain a better understanding of the actual materials of narrative art and their diverse functions. For example, we will examine the modernist literary experiments of authors like Joyce and Woolf through close reading, learning how to both decipher these authors’ literary techniques while constructing original arguments about the latter. We will look at how modernist literary experiments take place at the crossroads of experience, perception, and the formation of knowledge of the world. Modernist narrative language arguably creates the image of completely new matter in the texts under discussion through the construction of worlds unbound from plot and semantics. We also wish to examine how modernist literary techniques and effects differ from those used in painting, sculpture, music, dance, as well as other aesthetic mediums.

I envy you your broad scope, Jim.” –Jules et JimWe don’t often pay attention to bugs, unless they bite us, eat our plants, compromise our computers, or otherwise annoy us. In this course, we will try to put aside our squeamishness and examine plays, stories, poems, films, and scientific literature involving insects, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that may be visible only under a magnifying lens. We will cultivate our close-reading skills as we learn to analyze language and images with focus and care, without losing sight of the broad scope, the textual ecologies that our specimens inhabit. And we will consider what happens when tiny insects, writ large, are made to exemplify or critique human virtue, vice, and social organization. This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on revision, and students will be asked to complete small, focused writing assignments as well as more protracted essays. Texts may include:Aristophanes, WaspsPoe, “The Gold-Bug”Kafka, The MetamorphosisNabokov, “Father’s Butterflies”Hooke, Micrographiaselections from Seneca, Montaigne, Donne, Mandeville, Keats, Wordsworth, Dickinson, PollanFilm:Perrin, Microcosmos: Le peuple de l’herbeLasseter, A Bug’s LifeCourse Catalog Number: 17491

Julia NelsenIn this course, we will read stories set primarily within the walls of various hotels. Situating our texts in the broader context of the travel narrative, we will first consider the relationship between hosts and guests, the traditional “inn,” and storytelling. We will then shift our focus to modern representations of the hotel and its rooms as unique sites of betweenness, mobility and transgression, alienation and anonymity, where the world is seen and experienced from an altered vantage point. Questions to be addressed include: how do hotels dramatize, emphasize or disrupt the distinction between public and private, personal and impersonal, domestic and commercial? What does it mean to “live” in a hotel? How does the hotel represent both an escape from and a desire for a place called “home”? What of the vacant hotel? Beyond typical overnight accommodations, we will also consider similar spaces that highlight the relationship between permanence and transience, solitude and community, the exotic and the ordinary. Finally, we will explore what it means to consider the literary text itself as a figure for hospitality.Readings may include:Homer, The Odyssey, selectionsGeoffrey Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, selectionsThomas Mann, Death in VeniceVirginia Woolf, The Voyage OutFerenc Karinthy, MetropoleAli Smith, Hotel WorldWayne Koestenbaum, Hotel Theory, selectionsSiegfried Kracauer, “The Hotel Lobby”Selected poetry by T.S.

(1 unit Pass/No Pass)People today do not have enough poetry in their heads, and everyone should be able to recite one or two of their favorite poems. In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party some time, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.” In this seminar, we will read a number of classic poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types. Students will be encouraged to find other poems for the group to read. Participants will be required to memorize and recite 50-75 lines of their choice, and to prepare a short annotated anthology of their favorite poems.Steve Tollefson, a lecturer in the College Writing Programs, is the author of four books on writing and grammar as well as articles on a variety of subjects and several short stories.

Professor Timothy HamptonPlease note this course will meet for the 10 weeks.  The first class meeting will be Thursday, Sept 6th.Bob Dylan has named the nineteenth-century French poet Arthur Rimbaud as one of his major sources of inspiration.   In this seminar we will explore the connections between these two important writers.  First we will read carefully through the poetry and letters of Rimbaud, one of the most original and powerful of modern poets. We will try to get a sense of what makes Rimbaud’s poetry so influential, not only for Dylan, but for a whole host of modern artists.  Then we will study the intersection between Rimbaud’s work and Dylan’s.  Central to our concerns will be the role of the senses in poetic creation, as well as, of course, the relationship between lyric poetry and song.   Students will gain familiarity with the writing of a major modern poet and have the chance to work closely on issues of poetic language and versification.  Students will be expected to participate actively in the discussion and write two short papers.  The course will be in English.  No knowledge of French is required.Books on order:Rimbaud, Arthur.  Complete Works, Selected Letters, trans.

[PLEASE NOTE: This “introduction or gateway to the advanced study at the core of the comparative literature major” is expressly designed for students in, entering, or intending to enter the Comparative Literature Department’s major and/or students majoring in other literature departments, or in closely related areas within the humanities.  This seminar is UNSUITABLE FOR STUDENTS OUTSIDE THE COMPARATIVE LITERATURE MAJOR AND/OR CLOSELY RELATED LITERARY/HUMANITIES MAJORS due to the seminar’s intense literary and literary-critical specificity; it is NOT designed to meet the needs of students seeking to satisfy either general or area requirements of the University or of the College of Letters and Science.]
This seminar takes up a very big question as a way to begin exploring what comparative literary study is:  How do American poets, from about 1950 to the present, attempt formally and thematically to engage ethics and politics? An otherwise impossibly large field of inquiry will be delimited by our emphasis on something at the heart of this seminar’s status as a gateway or introduction to the advanced work undertaken in the Comparative Literature major: the process and experience of comparison itself. For while there would be many perspectives from which to approach American poetry’s ethical-political commitments during the last five decades, this particular seminar will focus on the ways that later-modernist and contemporary American poetry (mostly U.S., but with some attention to Latin American, Caribbean, and Canadian texts) have frequently sought to broach ethics and politics through a very specific dialogue: a dialogue with post-World War II German poetry and poetics. Most specifically, we will consider the powerful, extraordinarily influential, and very difficult work of the German-language poet Paul Celan (1920-1970) (often called one of Europe’s greatest poets–-perhaps its greatest–-since 1945). Born and raised in Romania (but with German as a foundational language if not a mother-tongue), interned in a Romanian-fascist labor camp during the war, Celan–-having lost his parents to the Holocaust–-lived most of his postwar life in France. Because Celan composed almost all his most significant poems in German, not the least difficult issue confronting him was how to write poetry in the very language in which the Nazi genocide had just been carried out. His grapplings with that and related problems–-and his astonishing development of unprecedented formal means of artistic expression (not least, a severely attenuated lyric musicality nonetheless breathtaking in its virtuosity and beauty) that could begin to do justice to his given materials (those materials stemming from and related to “what has happened,” as Celan sometimes referred to the Holocaust)–-led to the creation of a remarkable body of poetry that broke new ground while holding on to much in the history of lyric poetry.We will spend the first few weeks of the seminar considering Celan’s work (and, briefly, that of kindred post-World War II German and European poets, filmmakers, critics, and philosophers); we will then spend the rest of the seminar seeing how American poetry and poetics, starting in the mid-1950s, attempts to understand what Celan is doing in poetry and what he is asking postwar poetry to attempt. Among our questions–-which we will see various American poets likewise posing–-will be the degree to which Celan proves translatable (in the literal sense of the translation of his poems into English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc.; and in the metaphorical sense of attempted translations of his poetics, aesthetics, and ethics to American contexts that will involve, among other things, the concerns and claims of the civil rights, anti-colonialist, feminist, and anti-war movements–-and we will perhaps see this questioning above all in terms of American poets’ thinking, in their poetry and criticism, about what is shared and what is different in the historical experiences of European anti-semitism and New World slavery and racism: their thinking, in short, about what in Celan’s pathbreaking poetry in the wake of European fascism and genocide can, and cannot, help them as their artistic work develops its own relationships to pressing ethical and political matters). Throughout the course, these questions will help us pursue and develop our inquiry into just what comparative literature and comparative literary study are.(Additional Note: All texts originally written in German, French, Spanish, etc., will be read in, and our discussions will be based on, English translations; but we will almost always also have available, in facing-page editions or xeroxes/photocopies/PDFs, the original-language text for reference and comparison. Students will not be required to read German–-or French or Spanish–-though ability to read in those languages will of course add greatly to students’ encounters with the poems and translations originally made in those languages.)Course Catalog Number:

Professor Anne-Lise FrancoisHow do literary and filmic texts disclose and simultaneously keep their secrets? This course examines the role of secrets in producing and blocking narrative movement, and in releasing and withholding meaning. Particular attention is given to secrets such as the gay closet or racial passing, that, like Poe’s “Purloined Letter,” hide “in plain sight.” In comparing tragedies, films, case histories, novels, and short stories, we discuss the role of narrative and confessional acts in the construction, circulation and concealment of public and private identities, marked and unmarked by gender, sexual identity, race, or class. We also critically examine the implied analogies between interpretation and detective work, and between reading and religious election. What distinguishes interpretive “insight” from naïve reading? What kinds of ironic relationships obtain between “blind” characters and “perceptive” readers?Texts:Cortazar, “The Devil’s Spit”

AscoliAlso listed as Italian Studies 120Among the many attempts to prove that William Shakespeare was not really William Shakespeare but someone else, there is a little book entitled “Shakespeare fu un italiano”: Shakespeare was an Italian. This course will argue no such thing. Rather, we will explore the various ways in which Shakespeare was touched by and touched Italy, a country he only knew through books and second hand report. We will look at some of the works of Italian literature that he read and rewrote in his plays (works by Boccaccio, Ariosto, Bandello, and others), plays of his that are set in Italy (Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Merchant of Venice), Italian operas, works of literature, and films which re-present or appropriate Shakespeare’s oeuvre (Verdi’s Otello; Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author; and so on). In the process we will think about the process by which works circulate between places and over time, and how two very different cultures reciprocally interpret each other and in so doing, reveal themselves.Requirements: attendance and participation; in-class presentations and short assignments; 3 papers (1250-1750 words); final take-home exam or longer paper (2500 words)Readings: William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet, Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Merchant of Venice, OthelloGiuseppe Verdi, OtelloLuigi Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an AuthorGuido Ruggiero and Laura Giannetti, trans.

Maria KotzamanidouThis course focuses on the examination of female deviance from the accepted standards of society in terms of attitude and behavior. This course examines representations of deviance and the violation of the norms (social, cultural, gender, biological) by central female characters in 19th and 20th century Modern Greek fiction. By accepting these literary texts as cultural texts, and by placing them in their historical context, this course also examines how these powerful, polysemic characters are associated not only with literal but also with mythological levels of meaning. As Greek society shifts its focus from the community to the individual, the creation of these voices appears to echo the authors’ own concerns regarding the death of national ideologies, the disunity of the nation and the traumas of its modernization.All Greek materials for the Course are available in English translation.Foreign Films are subtitled.Course Catalog Number:

Professor Judith ButlerWe will focus on the short fiction, parables, and letters of Kafka – as well as The Trial –  in addition to theoretical discussions of Kafka’s works by Theodor Adorno , Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Georg Lukács, Gershom Scholem, and Jacques Derrida.  We will ask in what way Kafka’s work poses philosophical questions for his time, focusing on historical progress, authority, and the bodily form of human life.  We will engage in close readings of Kafka’s work to find out in what ways philosophical questions are posed in his writing, and how fiction becomes part of philosophical inquiry.texts:Kafka, The Blue Octavo Notebooks (Exact Change Press)1878972049

Professor Miryam Sas This seminar is designed as an introduction to graduate study in Comparative Literature. The readings and discussions consider theoretical models central to the discipline and their influential critiques. We begin with genealogies (origins) of the discipline, questions of reality and representation, and move on to consider the era of disciplinary revision/crisis, “high” theory and New Criticism, psychoanalysis and queer theory, theories of temporality and phenomenology, and postcolonial criticism, ending with  more recent works on affect and new media. Readings include works by Lukács, Auerbach, Benjamin, Adorno, Bergson, Foucault, Johnson, Ngai, Hansen, and others.The seminar will be coordinated with CL 201 (the Comparative Literature Proseminar) and a series of three or four events and performances on and off campus.Required texts:Reader will contain most readings (to be made available at Replica Copy, Oxford Street)Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, trans.

Christopher DavisThe poets known as the troubadour flourished in the South of France during the twelfth century; however, their poems had a vibrant afterlife, circulating in a variety of forms, both musical and textual, and shaping the development of subsequent European literatures. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the Occitan language and to the major poets, forms and movements that characterize the troubadour “tradition.” Among the works we will read are lyric poems by Bernart de Ventadorn, Arnaut Daniel and Bertran de Born, the parodic romance Flamenca, and the groundbreaking greammatical treatise of Raimon Vidal. We will also study authors such as Dante and Ausias March who were influenced by the troubadours and in turn played a role in defining their tradition. Special attention will be given to issues of orality and textuality, medieval language theory, manuscript studies and the emergence of regional languages and literatures. Readings will be in English, French and Occitan.Course Catalog Number:

An introduction to Renaissance humanism, focusing on the work of Petrarch, Bruni, Salutati, Valla, Machiavelli, Castiglione, Erasmus, More, Ascham, Elyot, Lipsius, and Shakespeare. In addition, we will read some of the classics of Renaissance scholarship (Burckhardt, Kristeller, Baron, Garin, Trinkaus, Greenblatt, Cave and Greene), as well as more recent work in the field. Topics will include Renaissance theories of imitation and literary production, the revival of classical rhetoric, humanist pedagogical practices, the civic and political function of rhetoric, the transformation of political theory, the relationship between Christianity and classical culture. We will also discuss the critique of humanism both in the early modern period and in modern evaluations of Renaissance humanist pedagogy by Grafton and Jardine, Halpern, Crane, Dolven and others. Reading knowledge of Italian or Latin is particularly useful but not required.This course satisfies the “intellectual history” requirement of the new Designated Emphasis in Renaissance and Early Modern Studies.Course Catalog Number:

C. SchollIn this course, we will explore the relationship between how literary empires are forged and how they are challenged. Reading texts regarded as classics of the Western canon* alongside 20th– and 21st-century texts from Africa and the Americas produced in self-conscious relationship to the earlier works, we will consider the ways in which narratives are transformed by authors writing from different historical and cultural locations. In doing so, we will see that, in fact, the canonical pre-texts are also appropriating and rewriting narratives generated by Europe’s imperial expansion—meaning that all of the texts we will be reading are in some sense postcolonial rewritings.This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on the practice of global revision/rewriting as a fundamental part of the writing process. Students will learn how to develop interesting arguments about the texts we are studying and how to refine these ideas through their drafting and revision of several analytical essays.* Canon: “A body of literary works traditionally regarded as the most important, significant, and worthy of study; those works of especially Western literature considered to be established as being of the highest quality and most enduring value; the classics (now freq. in the canon)” (OED). From ancient Greek kanon, meaning a “reed” or “rod” used as an instrument of measurement. Possibly derived from kanna, the etymological origin of both cannon, the heavy artillery used in European imperial expansion, and of the sugar cane that played a significant role in motivating and fueling the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism in the Caribbean.Possible textual pairings include:Homer, The Iliad and The Odyssey (selections) / Derek Walcott, Omeros (selections)

G. Page & K. FordThis course will focus on the relations between literature, history, and cosmopolitanism. We will read a selection of literary texts produced in the greater Atlantic region – Europe, North America, the Caribbean, and Africa – since the arrival of the Europeans in the Americas. The history of conquest, colonialism, plantation slavery, decolonization, and postcolonial migration makes the Atlantic region a zone of cultural exchange and creolization. As we read literary narratives that represent lives conditioned by this Atlantic history we will reflect on the concept of cosmopolitanism, interrogating the role that literature might play in producing transnational or cosmopolitan modes of thinking and feeling.Primary readings will likely include The Tempest, Robinson Crusoe, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, The Kingdom of this World, Home to Harlem, Voyage in the Dark, and White Teeth, but students should wait until the first day of class before purchasing the texts. This is also a writing intensive course with several essay assignments. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will learn how to articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying.Course Catalog Number: 17223

J. Hock and P. GerardIn The Republic, Plato condemps poetry for being too far removed from reality. A feeble imitation of the world (itself an imitation of ideal Ideas), poetry isn’t really “true” and thus distorts our understanding of the world and is a bad influence on young people. In the Poetics, Aristotle argues that didactic, or scientific, verse isn’t really poetry. From the Greeks onwards, we have tended to distinguish poetry and science as different modes of thought with different relationships to truth or the real, and different functions in society. This course will take a long view of this troubled history and read in the history of science, poetry, and poetic theory to question the traditional generic boundaries between scientific and literary texts and practices. From the farming manual that is Virgil’s Georgics to contemporary scholarship that uses neurological advances to analyze literature to science fiction from all periods, we will question the boundaries between science and literature and the practice of each.Reading List: Readings will likely include selections from the following works and authors, among others. They will be available at the University bookstore, in the course reader, or on bSpace.Hesiod, TheogonyPlato, RepublicOvid, Metamorphoses

D. Thow“The word “translation” comes, etymologically, from the Latin for “bearing across.” Having been borne across the world, we are translated men.” –Salman Rushdie, “Imaginary Homelands”Translation is everywhere.  But what is it, exactly?  The term is often used to mean anything transferred, adapted, communicated, displaced or interpreted. What does it mean when something is “lost in translation”?  What is the difference between a translator and an author?  In this class will examine translation as a creative process that bears meaning from one language to another, and think about many of the metaphors implied by the term. We will also examine the figure of the translator as a character in literature and film as someone who enables movement, transferal, transformation, adaptation, interpretation, but also loss.We will read many works of literature in translation and perform close comparative readings of various short translated passages over the course of the semester.   Our focus in this class will be to hone our analytical reading and writing skills, and translation will therefore serve as a model, one that makes interpretative claims about the meaning of a text.Course objectives:This is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper.  We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper.Required textsWilliam Shakespeare, The Tempest

B. Ruberg & C. GoldblattLike the time traveler revisiting to a fateful moment in history, literary and sci-fi authors alike return again and again to the theme of time travel. The trope dates back as far as mythology, appearing in early Jewish and Japanese texts. More recently, in the century following H. G. Wells’ Time Machine, innumerable characters have been hopping across the space/time continuum.  The popularity of these stories — A Wrinkle in Time, The Time Traveler’s Wife — challenge us to question: what about time travel, as a literary device and a thought experiment, so compels us? Dr. Who, the most prominent pop culture time traveler, has been on the air for sixty years! We might even extend the topic of time travel to include memoirs, historical fiction, anachronisms: all textual attempts to retell fact and self through temporal displacement.This course will stress both literary analysis and writing skills. Creative exercises will be paired with close readings and writing workshops, while we explore the history and attraction of time travel in fiction.Reading ListThe Time Machine, H.G. Wells (1895)

S. Schneider & O. ErezHow would our lives change if we lived in a two-dimensional universe? If we could travel freely, without subjection to borders, but had no one place to call home? How can a whole city be invisible? This course will encourage building critical reading, thinking and writing skills around literary works and theoretical essays, and films that consider space as a primary concern. These texts explore the invisible or unspoken laws governing even the most familiar places. Some of our texts ask how real or imaginative spaces reflect the encounters, experiences and memories of an individual. In others, space itself becomes the protagonist or antagonist. We will use our critical analyses to question how geographical, architectural and fictional spaces are manipulated or in turn manipulate us.Writing shares much with space-building: whether they be in a room, a city street, a border crossing or outer space, imaginative narratives are inextricable from their environments. Similarly, critical arguments also require a considered framework for their composition. By engaging with works of literature, film and photography that make clear allusions, through their depiction of space, to their mode and style of composition, we will consider the way we compose. Through readings and class discussions, we will focus on how to frame our narratives and arguments to get our audience on the same page with us.As this is a writing intensive course, many of our activities will be dedicated towards refining your prose. Assignments include a diagnostic paper, a 6-7 page analytical paper and a 10-page research paper. The two larger papers will include a draft and the final paper, and we will place a major emphasis on the process of revision. Other assignments include approximately bi-weekly bSpace postings, group presentations, a final, independent presentation and in-class writing exercises.Texts and films may include:Edwin A. Abbott Flatland

S. Cochran & O. ErezHunger is fundamental: both because it is utterly ordinary, shaping the course of our daily life, and also because it is simultaneously one of the most complex and mysterious of yearnings, shaping the murky landscape of our psyche.  It is as mundane as a craving for a ham sandwich and as abstract and often unconscious as a need to feel loved, a need to feel safe, or a need to feel connected to a community.In this course we will explore literature in which characters experience hunger of all sorts but are often uncertain of what exactly they are hungering for.  We’ll discuss Kafka’s “hunger artist,” who, as he performs great feats of starvation for crowds of spectators, feels perpetually misunderstood and lonely and can only think to starve himself for longer and longer periods of time.  We’ll meet a group of terrifying, flesh-eating wolves in Angela Carter’s short story, who never cease, nonetheless, to mourn their irremediable appetites.  We’ll read about the fairy tale witch who fattens up a little boy and girl to gobble them up herself.  And we’ll even meet on film “Hannibal the Cannibal” in the Silence of the Lambs, whose brutality in eating human bodies is matched only by his cultured politeness to the FBI agent whose own unconscious hungers he is keen to point out to her.This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, and research.Reading list:

L. Wagner & H.

M. LuceyIn the masterful hands of Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust, the novel becomes an instrument for studying and for experiencing what it means to exist in the world and in time. Both Woolf and Proust saw the world around them changing rapidly – the world of the new twentieth century, increasingly global, a world of artistic revolution, of technological innovation, of political upheaval,  of rapid social change, of international warfare. They wrote novels as part of studying that change, as part of thinking about the experience of change itself, the effects of change on our ability to perceive the world we live in.  In turn, their novels changed how people thought about and read novels. Some would say their novels contributed to changing our ability to see the new world around us. The novels of Woolf and Proust (Woolf, in fact, was an admiring reader of Proust) are now thought of as some of the most inventive, challenging, and influential novels ever written.  In this course we will explore Woolf and Proust’s aesthetic, philosophical, historical, and sociological experiments within the form of the novel.  We’ll read four novels by Woolf, part or all of four of the volumes of Proust’s seven-volume masterpiece, In Search of Lost Time, along with a few of their essays and a few essays by other writers.Marcel Proust, Swann’s Way, In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, Sodom and Gomorrah, Finding Time Again  (We will be reading the Penguin translations, series editor Christopher Prendergast.)Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, The YearsCourse Catalog Number: 17287

(1 unit Pass/No Pass)Bob Dylan has named the nineteenth-century French poet Arthur Rimbaud as one of his major sources of inspiration.   In this seminar we will explore the connections between these two important writers.  First we will read carefully through the poetry and letters of Rimbaud, one of the most original and powerful of modern poets. We will try to get a sense of what makes Rimbaud’s poetry so influential, not only for Dylan, but for a whole host of modern artists (including such figures as Patti Smith and Johnny Depp).  Then we will study the intersection between Rimbaud’s work and Dylan’s.  Central to our concerns will be the role of the senses in poetic creation, as well as, of course, the relationship between lyric poetry and song.   Students will gain familiarity with the writing of a major modern poet and have the chance to work closely on issues of poetic language and versification.  They will be expected to participate actively in the discussion and write a short paper.  The course will be in English.  No knowledge of French is required.Book on order:Rimbaud, Arthur.  Complete Works, Selected Letters, trans.

S. TollefsonPeople today don’t have enough poetry in their heads, and everyone should be able to recite one or two of their favorite poems. In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party sometime, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.”In this class we will read a number of “classic” poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types, and students will encouraged to find other poems for the group to read.Students will be required to memorize and recite between 50 and 75 lines of poetry throughout the semester. In addition, students will prepare a short anthology of their favorite poems, with an explanatory introduction for each poem.Course Catalog Number: 17287

M. KoernerIn this course we will explore the diversity of selected works of American literature, film, and music produced during the “long sixties” (1955-1975). Placing considerable emphasis on the relationship between artistic experimentation and emancipatory social movements, we will consider how innovative practices of language, image, and sound were mobilized alongside the more directly political actions associated with the Civil Rights Movement, the Student Movement, the Black and Red Power Movements, and the Women’s and Gay Liberation Movements. How have writers, filmmakers, visual artists, and musicians used their work to challenge war, racism, social and economic inequality, sexual violence and gendered discrimination? What critical and conceptual tools emerged in the encounters between artistic and social movements? What critical practices and theoretical orientations might enable us to better understand the points of connection between aesthetic and social revolutions? What, for instance, is at stake in the notion of a counter-culture or a cultural revolution? What criteria do we use to define “political art”?Given the persistence of the “sixties” in the U.S. cultural imaginary – mostly recently evidence by a range of new films, documentaries, and television series focused on this transitional period in U.S. history – a significant portion of this course will also be devoted to critically engaging contemporary adaptations and representations of past works, events, and figures associated with the “sixties.” How and for what purposes does the present “revision” the past? What claims does that past still make on our own present?Course materials include texts (poetry, fiction, journalism, manifestos), images (photographs, independent films, television clips, visual art), and sounds (music, recorded voice performances and political speeches) produced between 1955-1975, as well as selected contemporary films, documentaries, and critical essays. Written assignments include include several short response essays, a research paper and contributions to a course blog.Course Catalog Number: 17308

K. KurkeThis course will study sexuality and gender in two very different historical periods–ancient Greece and 19th-century Europe.  Sexuality will be defined as including sexual acts (e.g. sodomy, pederasty, masturbation); sexual identities (e.g. erastes and eromenos); and sexual systems (e.g. kinship structures, subcultures, political hierarchies).  Readings and lectures will focus on situating queer sexualities relative to dominant organizations of sex and gender.  Topics will include Greek democracy and male homosexuality; the biology of sexual difference; the politics of sodomy; “romantic” friendship between women and men; and the emergence of strictly defined homosexual and heterosexual identities.  We will read literary texts along with historical documents and critical essays to constitute a comparative analysis of ancient Greek and 19th-century European systems of gender and sexuality.Authors to be read include Hesiod, Sappho, Aeschylus, Plato, Wilde, Freud, and Foucault.There will be two papers and a final exam.  There will also be required weekly reading questions that will count towards your final grade.Course Catalog Number: 17335

The seminar will offer readings, discussions, and a sense of the trajectory across time and circumstance of some of the most influential texts in literary theory, criticism, and aesthetics from Plato and Aristotle until today. We will also attempt to apply these theoretical traditions to the actual practice of literary criticism by engaging (in essay assignments) the various theories and methodologies we’re studying with particular literary texts that students will likely be writing about in their Honors Theses. We’ll thus likewise consider some of the nuts and bolts involved in undertaking the sustained critical essay of forty or more pages that the Honors Thesis involves. The theory and criticism we’ll read and apply will include aspects of Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Neo-Classical, Enlightenment, Romantic and post-Romantic traditions, although we will emphasize the study of modern and recent trends (including New Criticism, Reader-Response, Psychoanalysis, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism/Deconstruction, New Historicism, Marxism, Feminism, and Race, Gender, and Sexuality-focused criticism). Our double-focus throughout the seminar will be on how literary theory and criticism have historically helped­-or hindered­-understandings of literature and literary/cultural works, and of how students can make literary theory and criticism help them as they think and work towards their upcoming H195 Honors Thesis projects (in terms of interpretation, analysis, methodology, and the practical tasks involved in writing a sustained critical essay).Course Catalog Number: 17353

Jessica Crewe & Cory MerrillTales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”?    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17209

Keith FordMemory is essential for personal and cultural identity; and memory is, for the most part, constructed as a narrative. Our sense of who we are – as individuals and as members of groups – depends upon the stories we tell about ourselves: stories that establish continuities over time, assign meanings to certain experiences, and create values.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17212

In an age crazed with reality television and celebrity biographies, the documentary genre throws into relief a number of questions that have long vexed and animated literature, photography, and film: What does it mean to show a life “as it really is”, to tell a story “as it really happened”?   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17266

Philip Gerard       – Maurizio Lazzarato, The Making of Indebted ManDebt is a way of life. In California, 50% of college seniors who graduated from non-profit institutions last year left school with some form of student debt. From this pool, the average obligation comes out to $20,250. As any 19th century novelist could tell you, this is an auspicious way to begin a story.In this Reading and Composition course we will pursue the topic of debt beyond the bounds of economics. From social obligations to moral duty, from financial lending to literary borrowing, we will examine the meaning(s) and genesis of debt as a concept and a metaphor. As we go over our own set of books, drawing on a series of artistic, anthropological and philosophical treatments of debt from a range of historical periods, we will refine our critical reading skills and study the art of making and defending an argument.As we explore the sorts of obligations that bind us, we will also be studying the craft of writing and revising an analytical paper.  Students can expect to write and revise two papers, give an in-class presentation, and complete several smaller assignments.Books  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17245

Adeline TranIn this course, we will investigate the question of narrative reliability and whether an objective, ‘reliable’ representation of reality is really possible.  We will look at the complexities of narration in fiction and film by first asking how we define the nature of truth and reality.  Is truth an objective viewpoint on our world or a set of subjective interpretations?  What role does ‘lying’ play in society, and how would the perspective of a biased or deceptive narrator problematize our interpretation of a text or film?  How do issues of perspective affect our perception of truth and reality?  We will examine how individual points of view shape the way we think, and we will be interested in how the themes of reliability and unreliability in art can help us learn about our own development as writers of essays.  This class includes two formal papers and places strong emphasis on active student participation.Texts:

Mandy CohenWhat if the Cold War became hot? What if John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry had succeeded?  What if the bomb under Hitler’s desk hadn’t missed? “What if” is the question that jump starts the imagination of children and scientists, writers and science fiction nerds, oppressed peoples and activists—everyone who thinks about making a different world possible. Science Fiction in general has sometimes been called “the literature of change”: take the world you know, imagine a possibly possible change, and chart the way from here to there. This course will zoom in on the hybrid child of science fiction and history: Alternate History. Alternate histories are science fiction that can take place in the past, the present or future, if only something in the “real world” had gone a little differently. We’ll look at examples from the hey-day of SF in 20th century US literature, but we’ll also explore older historical works and works from other literatures which ask the same question, “what if?”  Rather than escaping through a wormhole in search of sexy green aliens, we’ll investigate works in which “the literature of change” is concerned with this world: why are things the way they are? What’s gone wrong? And what are the political alternatives that might not be so fantastic, if we could only see the way from here to there?The major goal of this course is to develop and practice critical reading and writing skills for a broad range of analytical and research writing, with the alternate histories serving as rich, stimulating and hopefully fun material for our writing. Through workshops, revisions, and collaborative work we’ll improve our ability to read a text analytically, create interesting and meaningful arguments, and support those arguments through research. In addition to the works of fiction, we’ll read literary and historical essays both as writing models and to engage our readings with their ideas.Texts for the course will be:Octavia Butler. Kindred

Margarita GordonWe tend to view fact and fiction as polar opposites, opposites that shape our concept of knowledge, truth, and morality. Yet when we speak of “actual fact” in contrast to “mere fiction,” we often take for granted or simply ignore the basis for differentiating them from one another. In this course, we will endeavor to define the precepts—cultural, philosophical, and psychological—that govern this distinction.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17263

(1 unit Pass/No Pass)People today do not have enough poetry in their heads, and everyone should be able to recite one or two of their favorite poems. In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party some time, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.” In this seminar, we will read a number of classic poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types. Students will be encouraged to find other poems for the group to read. Participants will be required to memorize and recite 50-75 lines of their choice, and to prepare a short annotated anthology of their favorite poems.Steve Tollefson, a lecturer in the College Writing Programs, is the author of four books on writing and grammar as well as articles on a variety of subjects and several short stories.

One of the enduring appeals of novels is their ability to offer us access to other mind. Thus fictional characters can feel like close friends, and reading books can often be a practice in empathetic imagination, giving us the chance (at least for a few hundred pages) to walk in another’s shoes.

What can twenty-first century readers get out of reading works that were written in Greek and Latin thousands of years ago?  Is the primary goal historical understanding? the pleasure of an engaging story? a meditation on human emotions that transcend vast shifts in culture and time? In this class we will read some central texts from Greco-Roman antiquity, with the goal of exploring different notions of why this practice makes sense and what we can do with it.  Rather than start from the assumption that reading ancient texts is worth doing, this class will ask students to think critically about why and how such reading might matter or not matter. In fact, the questions we will ask are relevant for reading in general – what do we get out of texts that intersect with our own experience and what do we get from those very foreign to our own experience?Course Catalog Number: 17295

Professor Karl BrittoIn recent years, many of the most celebrated and widely-read authors of postcolonial literature have produced novels that engage with a variety of sub-genres within the field of crime fiction, including the “hardboiled” detective novel, the roman noir, and the serial killer novel. What might account for this literary turn toward the dystopian, toward texts constructed around mysteries and often marked by shocking descriptions of extreme violence? In what ways do the genres of crime fiction allow writers to engage with long and complex colonial and post-colonial histories, and to address issues of social, political, and economic injustice? To what extent is storytelling itself implicated in these narratives of crime? In what ways do writers push the generic boundaries of crime fiction, and to what ends? How do bodies function as sites of textual meaning in crime fiction, and how do crime narratives complicate notions of identity and identification? In this seminar, we will consider these questions and others through readings of several novels whose narratives emerge out of different historical, cultural, and geographic contexts. Please note: because electronic devices make interesting conversation difficult, students are asked to come to class with paper copies of the course reader and books. In addition to secondary readings, texts to be considered include:Patrick Chamoiseau, Solibo Magnificent (Anchor)

Maria Kotzamanidou course has no prerequisitesThis course is concerned with works of fiction written before or after the seven-year military dictatorship of 1967, a regime marked by various degrees of censorship. These works examine the relationship between established structures (social, historical, religious) and modern worldviews that reflect multiple levels of reality and multiple belief systems. In these novels, whether written before or after the Greek totalitarian regime, the vision of the future is prophetic and frequently apocalyptic.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17323

We will consider the critical and ethical debates that have arisen around the book, and we will look at the novel’s transposition to the screen (Nabokov’s screenplay, Kubrick’s classic and Lyne’s recent treatment). We will examine the novel’s relationship to the genre of pornography and to notions of a discursive “body.”   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17329

Professor Robert KaufmanThis seminar is an introduction to graduate study in Comparative Literature for incoming Comparative Literature Ph.D. students. Our readings and discussions will attempt to at least begin a formal, critical-theoretical, and historical overview—including considerations of influential critiques of the discipline—of Comparative Literature.  Along the way, we’ll look at developing notions of how scholars, critics, and literary historians (not to mention artists) have understood terms like text, form, genre, history, culture, theory, criticism, methodology, and, of course, literature and comparison themselves.   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17374

We will focus on early modern to twentieth-century poetry written in English, French, German, Italian and Japanese, in the age of print culture or what will later become, in Walter Benjamin’s terms, the “age of mechanical reproducibility.”   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17379

Professor Judith ButlerThe seminar will consider how different versions of critique are developed within some major figures in Critical Theory. We will consider how Kant formulates the notion of critique in some of his essays and in sections of the Critique of Pure Reason, especially as it seeks to delimit the phenomenal world in which certain kinds of knowledge are restricted. We will then ask in what forms critique reemerges within Hegel’s writings, focusing on the opening chapters of The Phenomenology of Spirit and some of his early essays on sensuous understanding and property. The course will end with a consideration of the early Marx, focusing on his own critique of German Idealism, abstraction, and the importance of sensuous and embodied action and thought. One task of the course will be to understand the grounds and objects of critique in these thinkers, underscoring points of convergence and divergence.This course is instructor approval only. The application process is as follows: please provide Professor Butler with a brief one page letter explaining your background and why you are interested in taking the course (including whether the course counts as a requirement for your major or emphasis).Letters are due by email (jpbutler@berkeley.edu) by May 10th.Course Catalog Number: 17392

There is both a vast and various literature written from and about desert ecosystems and a literature that uses the figure of the desert to explore cultural barrenness, human mortality, and catastrophe. In this course we will read texts from these diverse traditions, including poems, tracts, essays, novels, and films about life in the Sahara and the Sonora, about mystical and secular experiences of the non-human world, celebrations of sublime nature, and portentous visions of a post-human future.Though the idea of the desert is relevant to a host of contemporary concerns, from droughts and other forms of ecological threats and transformations to the wars, migrations, and varied humanitarian crises taking place in deserts around the world today, this course will also look back to history and prehistory, to forms of culture and expression that developed and flourished in what we tend to think of as the least generative of landscapes. While global in scope, our course will place a particular emphasis on the literatures of the Arab world and the Americas.In the same way that the works examined here explore the delicate and complex systems that underlie the idea or symbol of the desert that we often take for granted, so too will we explore the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader, focusing in particular on the process, as well as the product, of writing.Required Books:(1) Gold Dust by Ibrahim al-Koni
(2) Pedro Páramo by Juan Rulfo

Class Format: This is a discussion-based seminar rather than a lecture course. Most of our class time will be spent talking about the assigned reading but we’ll also hold regular writing workshops. Some of these workshops will be devoted to specific writing skills, others will involve peer editing.  During the latter we expect you to engage with the work of your peers with the same rigor and
intensity that you bring to the class readings. Every paper that you turn in will first receive the attention of at least one of your fellow students.
Assignments: The bulk of the writing you’ll do in this class will go into the three major papers due at roughly equal intervals over the course of the semester. We expect you to come up with your own topic for each of these papers—you’ll see little in the way of prompts in this class—and to then run the idea by one of us before diving in. Before receiving your final draft of each paper we’ll also expect you to hand in (1) an outline or some other substantial form of writing preparation and (2) a polished draft. Please note that this draft should not be rough work filled with grammatical errors–though we’ll spend some time going over some of the trickier issues in writing mechanics, this class is more about putting together an essay than putting together a sentence. If you’re nervous about a grammatical point, a question of usage, or another mechanical issue, please feel free to shoot us an email and ask about it.These three papers will account for a full 60% of your grade in the course (the first two will be worth 15% apiece and the last one 30%). If you receive a C+ or below on either of your first two papers, we’ll give you one chance to improve that grade through a substantive rewrite. Come talk to us before you start rewriting so that we can hash out exactly what would constitute a “substantive” revision of the paper.Another 25% of your grade will come from shorter writing assignments and presentations.  The final 15% will come from your overall class participation. Though we expect you to contribute to our class discussions, we’re also aware that everyone has a different level of comfort with this specific kind of participation. Thus, in grading your participation we’ll also be taking into account the amount of care and attention that you pay to your bCourses posts, to your short writing assignments, and to the comments you make on your fellow students’ drafts. Office hour visits are another meaningful form of class participation.Rules and Procedures: Timely attendance is mandatory. You will get two fully excused, no-questions-asked absences from the class. For every absence after the first two that you don’t negotiate with us beforehand or later demonstrate to me was prompted by an emergency, medical or otherwise, we’ll drop your participation grade by a third (from an A- to a B+, for example). We’ll also count every two instances of your coming to class late as an unexcused absence.  We’re similarly strict about deadlines. For every calendar day that your paper is late, it will be marked one-third of a grade lower (again, an A- becomes a B+). If you face an emergency that
forces you to miss a deadline, please let us know at least 24 hours before said deadline.Outlines and prewritings can be single-spaced but every paper you turn in must be in a regular font, double-spaced, and feature one-inch margins all around. We’d rather you be honest and turn in work slightly under the expected page count rather than try to trick us by changing your page formatting.Please get yourself a good-sized folder that you can devote exclusively to this class. You’ll be turning your work in in this folder and every time you turn in a new assignment, all of your previous assignments should be in it as well.Finally, all plagiarized work will receive a failing grade. Plagiarism isn’t just copying or buying an entire paper or writing exercise from another student; plagiarism is also copying paragraphs, sentences, or ideas without credit, “quoting without quotation marks,” cutting and pasting (whether from another essay, from a reference work like Wikipedia, or from sites like Shmoop or SparkNotes), or otherwise passing off the thoughts, words, and/or ideas of others as your own, consciously or unconsciously.  Having seen your papers through from conception to outlining to the draft stage, we’ll notice any attempts at plagiarism. So don’t waste your time—it’d be faster and easier to do your own work.  For further information, please see:http://catalog.berkeley.edu/policies /conduct.html#cheating  http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conduct.aspAdditional Help: If you’d like some extra help on your writing, especially with the mechanics of composition, please head over to the Student Learning Center at the César Chávez Student Center for free tutoring. They’ll either hook you up with a tutor you can meet regularly throughout the semester or help you on a drop-in basis, depending on what you need. You can find their website here:

Narratives preoccupied with how to recover and retell a lost story.  Museum installations that assemble and remake remnants of a past. Anthropologists obsessed with documenting threatened cultures before they presumably disappear. What do these imply about questions of rescue, recovery, and reuse? What happens
when we ‘salvage’ something—an object, a history, a culture—and what does this practice These are just some of the questions we will explore alongside our intensive work on writing. This course fulfills the first half of the University Reading & Composition (R&C) requirement, and we will dedicate ample time to critical thinking and essay-writing skills, paying special attention
to argumentation, analysis, and the basics of college-level writing.Texts and Materials:“Diving into the Wreck,” Adrienne Rich

Course Objectives:Skills that we will build together include. . .Close Reading: Close reading is all about paying attention and taking the time to notice and consider elements of a text, material, or film that may not be obvious at first glance. It begins when you read and observe with care, making notes, jotting down questions, and paying attention to a text or film’s devices and themes. It then involves choosing certain passages or elements to analyze in detail.Critical Thinking: Critical thinking is challenging because it requires us to move beyond our assumptions and engage what we read and see with an open mind and a critical eye.  It involves asking many questions and considering multiple, even conflicting ‘answers’ in the process of thinking about what a text or image might convey and how it seems to function.Critical thinking also requires that we examine the assumptions that are built into or implied by a work or argument.Formulating and Articulating Arguments: Every paper that you write in this class will require you to make, support, and develop a unique argument.  When you make an argument, you make a claim rather than describe or repeat, and you work with evidence to support this claim.  Learning how to formulate and articulate arguments involves more than listing your ideas about a text or
material; we need to present these ideas in a focused and organized way.  Working with arguments will also require you to support your claim with evidence, showing your audience that you have reasons, close-readings, and examples to back up your ideas.Class discussion and dialogue: Our classroom will be a space for sharing ideas, asking questions, listening to each other, and contemplating different points of view. This is not a lecture course; our goal is to form an intellectual community that dialogues and collaborates. Much of our classroom time will be spent discussing in groups large and small, and discussion boards on bCourses will provide opportunities for us to exchange ideas about what are reading and prepare for our in-class discussions. We will also participate in Reading Circles, small groups of four to six students who read and research one of the materials on our syllabus and then lead our class discussion of that text or material.Assignments & Grading:One three-page diagnostic essay Required
Two four-page papers (drafts & final versions)* 60 points
One six-page paper (draft & final version)* 60 points
Circle Group work (meeting & presentation) 20 points
Frequent short writing assignments 20 pointsAttendance 20 points
Participation 20 points
Total possible: 200 pointsYou must complete all paper and revision assignments in order to pass this class.  This includes the diagnostic essay, which, although not assigned a letter grade, is a required * Drafts are worth 50% of a total paper grade (for example, 15 points out of 30).Accommodations: If you need disability-related accommodations in this class, request them from the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) and inform the instructor within the first two weeks of the semester. The DSP office is responsible for verifying that students have disability-related needs and for planning appropriate accommodations in cooperation with the students
themselves and their instructors. DSP: 230 César Chávez Student Center, 510-642-0518 (voice) and 510-642-6376 (TTY).Attendance: Students are expected to attend all class sessions and come to class having read and thought about the readings and materials assigned. Class begins promptly, and attendance will be taken at every class session. If you are not present when roll is called (i.e. you are absent or late), you will be marked as absent. More than 1 absence will impact your grade, as each additional one reduces your attendance score (worth a total of 20 points out of 200) by 4Participation: This is a discussion-driven course, and your active participation is key. In-class participation can take many forms, including voicing an observation, offering a comment, posing a question, responding to a classmate’s idea, or volunteering to read aloud. Group work and in-class peer review activities also count toward your participation grade, as do discussions through bCourses.Because this is a discussion-driven course, we will use our class time to focus on sharing and engaging ideas.  In order to minimize distractions, laptop computers are not permitted in the classroom. Text messaging is also not allowed, as your cell phones should be turned off and put away.Late Assignments:  Unless otherwise stated in course materials, all assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date assigned. If a student submits a late assignment, it will be graded, but the grade will be reduced a third of a letter grade for each calendar day or portion thereof that the assignment is late. For example, a paper that is two days late and earns an A-Submitting Assignments: Except for essays marked for electronic submission (see course schedule), you must submit hardcopies of all assignments. In the case of essays due electronically, these must be emailed to the instructor as Microsoft Word documents and time-stamped by 3 p.m. on the specified due date.Academic Integrity and Plagiarism: The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted an Honor Code that states, “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”  The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code and that an attitude of honesty, integrity, and respect will shape all your interactions with your classmates and their ideas, as well as your engagements with the materials that we study this.   To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action.  For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see: http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/instruct/guides/citations.html#Plagiarismhttp://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.htmlCOURSE SCHEDULEThis schedule is tentative and will be modified according to our needs as a class. Short writing assignments and bCourse discussion prompts may not be listed here but are announced in class.  Reading indicates the assigned reading for the next class. Come to the next class ready to go.Writing indicates a writing assignment due at the next class session. Unless the assignment is
marked for electronic submission, print and bring a hardcopy to class.Course Catalog Number: 12984

																	Margarita Gordon, Nicole Jones2015-16 R1A Course DescriptionPERSONS/PERSONAS“Now the whole life of mortal men, what is it but a sort of play, in which various persons make their entrances in various  costumes, and each one plays his own part until the director gives him his cue to leave the stage? Often he also orders one and the same actor to come on in different costumes, so that the actor who just now played the king in royal scarlet now comes on in rags to play a miserable servant. True, all these images are unreal, but this play cannot be performed in any other way.”—Erasmus, The Praise of Folly (1511)Considering that we tend to think of personas as extraneous to persons or personalities, it may come as a surprise that the word person etymologically derives from the word persona rather than the other way around. This Latin term refers to the masks originally worn by actors in Greek, and later Roman, drama, by which the audience was able to identify the characters (or types) they represented. At the same time, the holes in these masks amplified the sound of the actors’ own voices (per sonare meaning to sound through).This class will be devoted to exploring personas as acts or roles that simultaneously conceal and reveal the people behind them and also to exploring the collaborations between actors, directors, and audiences that produce these them. What personas, we will ask ourselves, are being crafted in our texts? Who crafts or projects them and to what personal, political, or aesthetic ends? What influence do context and culture have? Are these impersonations performed successfully? How are multiple personas reconciled with one another, or with a “true” self? How, indeed, do we, or can we even, differentiate between the person and the persona?Already in the Classical period, personas became associated not just with role-play in the theater but with role-play in everyday life. Thus, in exploring the personas featured on our syllabus, we can reflect on those all of us, whether or not we’re aware of it, perform in our own lives: in our various relationships, in our work, and online. Who are we, really?Texts may include:Erving Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life
Desiderius Erasmus, The Praise of Folly
William Shakespeare, Richard III
Natalie Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre
Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

Some of the topics we’ll be thinking about include the role of institutions in shaping social identity, gender roles and identity, selfhood and community, forms of social adaptation and
resistance, and various cultural significations attached to ‘growing up’.This is a writing class as well as a discussion class. Over the semester, we’ll be talking about writing and doing plenty of writing and revision. There will be opportunities to build writing skills in short assignments in class and in progressively longer written assignments which you will submit over the semester.  Two key skills which we’ll be working on over the semester include making and developing observations about what you have read in a close reading of the text, and producing a written argument which is supported by evidence.Texts:The Brothers Grimm, selected fairytales (online link)

Please bring a hard copy printout of PDFs to class on the days on which we were discussing them.  As we will be referencing texts on the syllabus when discussing them in class, it is important to bring hard copy print-outs of pdfs and any
readings to class on the day that we are covering them.Course requirements:Course requirements are:  one short diagnostic essay (2 pp); three  2 pp. assignments, of which one must be submitted in revised form; five one-page assignments of reading response and textual observation, of which one must be revised; one 3-4 pp midterm paper (draft and final version); and a 5 pp. final paper (draft and final version).  Students will be required to make one group presentation (approximately 10 min), and to make posts on the online forum as assigned over the semester.All assignments and papers must be submitted as typed, doublespaced hard copy with standard 1 inch margins.  Please print your assignments double-sided.  Submit the final version of any revised assignment or paper securely clipped together with the hard copy of your draft and any comments received.  Submitting all assignments and revisions is a requirement for passing this R1A class. Please also be aware that you must meet the page requirements of assignments, as total page counts of written assignments are
an important requirement of this writing course.Attendance and class participationAttendance and active classroom participation (paying attention and constructively participating in discussion) are an important component of this class.  In-class discussion is an important way of sharing your ideas about class material with others, and learning from others’ responses.  For purposes of facilitating class participation and limiting in-class distractions, please be sure to turn off and put away your cell phones, smart phones, I-Pods, tablets, laptops and other electronic communication devices during the class.Attendance is important. Each unexcused absence will lower your final grade by one level (from A- to B+, from B- to C+, etc.).  Seven unexcused absences is an automatic fail of the class.Lateness policyIt is your responsibility to plan your schedule so that this course does not conflict with your other activities and responsibilities. Please arrive on time and avoid scheduling conflicts which require you to leave early.   In general, please do not leave the classroom and return during class time as this can be disruptive. A pattern of lateness will affect your grade. Three latenesses to class, defining lateness as arriving to class more than five minutes after the start time, will count as one unexcused absence or missed class. Any
lateness in turning in graded assignments will result in dropping the grade of the assignment one level (from A- to B+, from B- to C+) for each day of lateness.Attendance policy for the first 2 weeks of classAttendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes. Roll will be taken every day during this period.  Enrolled and waitlisted students who do not attend all classes during the first two weeks may be dropped from the class.  At the end of the first and second week of classes, students will be added from the waitlist.  If you are attempting to add into this class and did not attend the first day, you will be expected to attend all class meetings thereafter and, if space permits, you will be allowed to enroll.  No students will be added after end of the second week of the term without permission from the Department.  Students can only be added from the wait-list.Grade breakdownParticipation (Attendance, contribution to class discussions, group presentations, and required online posts):  20%

While many domestic texts conclude with an affirmation of the importance of family solidarity and security, we will focus instead on novels, plays, and films about unhappy families. What formal and stylistic methods do the writers of these texts use to engage reader sympathy for their characters? How do novelists and playwrights use the social institution of the family to express anxieties about industrialization, urbanization, and the Other? What models for (or warnings about) family life do these novels produce? And what possibilities do visual media such as film or stage performance offer to artists representing or
reimagining the social conventions of the family?  We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.Required TextsMary Shelley, Frankenstein

5%   Attendance and ParticipationCourse ObjectivesThis course, the second installment of the required Reading and Composition series, will focus primarily on the analytical and writing skills needed to write a coherent research paper. University requirements mandate that every student in an R1B course produce at least one diagnostic paper and two longer essays (with drafts), for a total of 32 pages of writing.  However, we are not going to launch straight into a 32-page writing assignment. This course will use a combination of writing workshops, reflective homework assignments, class discussion, and group presentations to build up your critical reading and writing skills. In analyzing a series of provocative and difficult texts, we will develop the critical outlook and vocabulary that will be the root of your final project. By the end of this course, you should feel able to present your own research in a well-organized, 10- to 12-page paper.Writing AssignmentsThis semester, we will be working on honing both your analytical and your research skills. There will be four individual papers.  The first is a short sample essay of 2-3 pages. The second is a 6-8 page literary analysis, which will be graded and returned with comments. The third paper will be a revision of your 6-8 page analytical paper.  Substantial revisions are mandatory; you should think of the revision as a fresh paper loosely based on your first draft.  Papers 2 and 3 will each receive their own grades.  These papers will serve as a review of what you learned in R1A and will not include research.The final project for this class will be your research paper.  Your rough draft will be 8 to 10 pages; the final version will be 10 to 12 pages long.  You will choose the text you will research in late October.HomeworkWe will assign homework regularly; assignments will include reading responses and close readings of selected passages from the class’s texts. These assignments will provide an important basis for your papers, and will also help you contribute to class discussion and activities. Periodically, there will be unannounced reading quizzes, so be sure to come thoroughly prepared to each class session.Performance ProjectAs part of our larger discussion of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and Harold Pinter’s “The Lover,” we are going to ask you all to present sections of the texts to the class. In groups, you will choose a portion of one of the plays that you believe is particularly vital to a central theme of that text. You will perform this portion of your selected play. You should then give a close reading of the section you have selected, addressing why it is essential to your interpretation of the play and how it relates formally to the work as a whole. Following your performances, we will collect two-page reflections from each of you on why your group chose this particular scene and what kinds of interpretative decisions you made in presenting it the way that you did.Lateness Policy and ExtensionsPapers must be turned in on time.  Your paper grade will be lowered by 1/3 letter grade (B B-, B- C+, etc.) for each day it is late.  It is your responsibility to balance the requirements of this class with those of your other classes.  That said, extensions will be granted in extreme circumstances with prior consent. Please keep in touch if you are having trouble completing an assignment!  We can discuss arrangements to accept late work if you let us know before the paper is due that you need more time.Attendance and ParticipationAttendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes; roll will be taken every day during this period of both regular and waitlisted students.  Anyone who does not attend all classes during the first two weeks will be dropped from the class.  During the second week of classes, students will be added from the waitlist, and no students may be added after the second week of the term without permission from the Department. Over the course of the semester, you are granted 2 unexcused absences without penalty; all other absences required advance notice and adequate excuse. 2 late arrivals to class (that is, 2 arrivals after 9:45) will also constitute an unexcused absence. Your grade will automatically be lowered 1% for each additional unexcused absence.Participation is a vital part of this course; while there will be occasional lectures and presentations, your active participation is a key component to the success of the class! Please come to class prepared to share observations and questions on the texts we encounter.PlagiarismThe University has a strict policy on Plagiarism:“Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example: Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without

We will look at the complexities of narration in fiction and film by first asking how we define the nature of truth and reality. Is truth an objective viewpoint on our world or a set of subjective interpretations? What role does lying play in society, and how would the perspective of a biased or deceptive narrator problematize our interpretation of a text or film? And what happens to us, the readers, once we suspect the narrator to be “unreliable”? How does this heighten our attention, affect our perception of truth and reality, and possibly introduce us into a mode of critical thinking?This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, one short diagnostic essay and two longer analytical research papers.Required ReadingAlbert Camus, The Stranger
Arthur Schnitzler, Dream Story
Henry James, The Turn of the Screw
E.T.A. Hoffmann, The Sandman
Vladimir Nabokov, LolitaAdditional reading material will be posted on bCourses.PapersThere will be three papers for this class. The first is a short diagnostic essay due at the end of the first week of class in which you will demonstrate your analytic and composition skills. It is only worth 5% of your grade, but please do your best on this; the purpose of this assignment is for us to see what elements of writing and analysis we should focus on this semester, as our instruction will be
tailored to students’ needs.  All papers must have an argumentative thesis supported by evidence from the text in the form of close readings. You will write rough drafts for papers 2 and 3. Late papers will not be accepted; if you need an extension, you must let us know well in advance. This class moves very quickly, and it is in your best interest to turn in all work on time.Papers should also adhere to correct format and citation procedures we will discuss in class.  In your reader, you will find a grading rubric so that you know what we are looking for; we do not believe that grades should be a mystery. All drafts should be turned in with prior drafts, outlines, peer editing work, etc. attached.AttendanceAttendance is required. After the first two weeks of classes, you are allowed two unexcused absences. If you are sick or have an emergency, you must email us before the class you will miss. You are responsible for turning in all assignments on time and for all material covered in class, whether or not you are in attendance. Additional absences will affect your participation grade. If you are sick
but already have two unexcused absences, or are sick for the second time, you will need a doctor’s note (such as an appointment confirmation from the Tang Center’s Urgent Care) for the absence to be excused.You should come to class on time (class starts promptly at 9:40am). We will be covering a lot of material, and your attendance and participation are essential to the academic environment. Arriving late is disruptive; if you are late more than twice in the semester, your grade will be affected. If you must leave early, please notify us before class begins.ParticipationThis class is based on active, engaged discussion. This means that you must be in attendance, awake, and prepared to participate. You should have your book and any additional materials (reader, articles, short assignments). Coming to class without your book is unacceptable. Your participation grade is based on these elements, as well as on your level of contribution to class and small group
discussion. If you don’t like to speak up in class, see us to make alternative arrangements. Part of any discussion is listening; please help us to create a receptive, comfortable environment. We encourage you to agree or disagree with your classmates, but please do so in a respectful manner.
Food, Drink, and ElectronicsFeel free to bring water, coffee, etc. Do not eat in class. Please do not bring your laptop or iPad to class. Turn cell phones off. Do not send text messages during class.HomeworkYou will have two types of homework: reading and writing. Reading should be done pen in hand; you should underline and take notes. Sometimes we will give you questions to guide your reading or ask you to pick passages to focus on. But in general, read carefully and with attention to detail. Note recurring elements, apparent themes, interesting details, or anything that seems difficult.  Come to class prepared with questions and comments on the reading.  In addition to the close readings and papers listed on the syllabus, you will have frequent short assignments and pre-writing work. Written work is due at the beginning of class on the day it is listed on the syllabus (or, if specified, by email). Late work will not be accepted without our prior consent. All work, without exception, should be typed and proofread.Group PresentationsOn the second day of class, you will sign up to give one 15-minute group presentation on one of the texts we will be reading. Each group must meet on their own to prepare, and has the option of meeting with us as well. The presentations should focus on the historical background of the novel—the author, the time period, the country, etc. Each presentation should have a written
component (like a handout), an interactive component (discussion questions, a game), a visual aid (poster, Powerpoint presentation), and a properly formatted bibliography to be turned in at the end of the presentation. Each member will have an opportunity to report back on his or her individual experience. You will be graded as a group.Grade BreakdownAttendance and Participation 25% Paper 1 5%
Group Presentation 10% Paper 2 20%
Short Assignments 15% Paper 3 25%Office Hours and Email Communication  Please come to our office hours! The point of this course is to improve your writing and reading skills, and often students will need extra help. If you come for help with a paper, please come to the meeting prepared, with specific questions and some good thinking already underway. Believe us: coming to office hours helps your writing and, subsequently, your grade in the course. It is also a good opportunity to have one-on-one instruction at a large university.If you can’t make our office hours, email us to find a time that works for us both. You are also welcome to send us academic questions via email, but please do not send paper drafts. When emailing, please write, spell, and punctuate accordingly!SLC TutoringWhile we will spend a lot of time working on writing in class and during office hours, we can’t cover everything. We recommend that students who need more help with writing mechanics use the Student Learning Center in the Golden Bear Building on Sproul Plaza. A range of tutoring options is available, including drop-in tutoring for help with a single assignment and individual tutors who will work with you for the entire semester. R&C students have first priority, but for a dedicated tutor, be sure to make arrangements during the first week of classes. For more information, go to: http://slc.berkeley.edu/bCoursesPlease create a bCourses account for yourself after the first day of class: https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/. We will use bCourses to post announcements, assignments, and additional course materials. You are responsible for keeping up with our bCourses course site.PlagiarismThe University has a strict policy on plagiarism: “Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example: Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without acknowledgment.

A glance into the literature of any period or place bears witness to the complexity of this relationship.  Across continents and centuries, writers have depicted nature contradictorily: as a space inspiring fear and respect yet also as a space providing succor and comfort; as force to be restrained and dominated or instead as a force to be accepted and embraced; as a presence from which we should distance ourselves (in ways both existential and visceral) or, conversely, as a presence with which we should connect (in ways equally existential and visceral).  This course, by engaging with a variety of genres and art forms, will explore some of the many ways that diverse cultures and time periods have represented and related to nature.  We will discuss themes such as Farming and Land Management; Shifting Perspectives; Labor and the Pastoral; Escapism, Solitude and Solipsism; and Anarchy, Activism and Sustainability. Authors and works for this course include: Elbow, Peter: Writing Without Teachers
 Plato: Critias
 Cortazár, Julio: “La Isla al mediodia”
 Virgil: Georgics
 Leopardi, Giacomo: Little Moral Works (in selection)
 Shakespeare, William: The Winter’s Tale

 Neruda, Pablo: Odes (in selection)
 Fincher, David: Fight Club
 Reynolds, Michael: Garbage Warrior
This is a reading and writing intensive course with several essay assignments which will build upon the skills acquired in R1A. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying while entering the world of literary criticism and learning to integrate and interrogate criticism in their own writing. This course satisfies the University requirement for the R1B Reading and Composition class.Course Catalog Number: 17245

Office Hours: Fridays 11 AM – 1 PM,  TBA Dwinelle Hall“The world is little, people are little, human life is little.  There is only one big thing—desire.”—Willa Cather, The Song of the Lark“Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the
tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.”—Roland Barthes, A Lover’s DiscourseDesire manifests in different forms: the desire for a commodity, the desire for status, the desire for love, the desire for sex, etc. While some desires easily find social approval and validation, others appear forbidden and taboo. We all desire, but how often do we critically reflect upon our own desires? What kinds of knowledge about the world or ourselves do our desires enable us to obtain, and what kinds of ethical problems do we confront as desiring beings subject to various passions? In this course we will answer these and other questions as we explore the significance of desire through our careful reading of various novels, poems, and philosophical texts that deal with different forms of desire. We will analyze how the social, the somatic, and the psychological intersect in the production and repression of desires. Along the way we will also explore how desire affects the very structure of a literary work and the significance of desire for linguistic expression. Our range of texts, spanning from ancient Greece to 1970s France, will allow us to observe the manifestation and significance of desire in various historical and sociocultural contexts, and we will examine the ways in which desire is pertinent to discourses of gender, sexuality, race, and class.This course is designed to help students develop critical thinking, writing, and oral expression skills that are applicable beyond the domain of literary studies. Students will learn how to develop interesting analytical arguments, incorporate research into their
writing, and refine their ideas through the drafting and revision of two essays. Short bCourses posts will also be required in order to help facilitate thinking about the course’s material. Since this is a discussion-based course, a strong emphasis will be placed on active student participation in class.Required Texts:Plato, The Symposium (Penguin)

Attendance, Participation, & Preparation: 15%—————————————————Course Policies:Writing: One of the primary objectives of this course is to show how better reading makes for better writing. Writing workshops will help acquaint you with the ins and outs of college-level writing, and reading assignments and in-class discussions will give you
something about which to write. You will learn what an argument is, what can be argued, and how to argue it, as well as how to use introductions, conclusions, evidence, and even punctuation to your utmost advantage. You will also learn how to incorporate
secondary sources such as criticism and other scholarly work into your writing. The course requires at least 32 pages of writing on your part. First drafts will be assigned a provisional grade to indicate the grade that the draft would have received had it been a final draft. As one objective of this course is to practice revision, first drafts must be complete papers. Failure to submit a complete first draft will result in a lowered grade for the final draft. (See “Late Papers & Assignments” for further details.)All essays must be typed and double-spaced with one-inch margins. In addition to the essays, you will complete several shorter writing assignments throughout the course, both in class and at home. These include the required bCourses posts, which are to be posted by midnight on the night before class. Exploratory essay assignments are designed to help you begin thinking about the content of your midterm and final essays. A good exploratory essay consists of a 3-4 page focused analysis that unfolds the complexity of a particular issue within a primary text and concludes with a tentative thesis. An inability to respond to the text in these writing assignments will be reflected in your grade.All papers must be accompanied by a works cited page that includes your primary source(s) and any secondary sources that have contributed to your paper. The works cited page and in-text citations should be in an accepted format (MLA or Chicago). Please remember that the works cited section does not count towards the total number of required pages. Papers and bibliographies are due electronically via e-mail on their assigned due dates.Late Papers & Assignments: Written assignments must be submitted on time. For every calendar day that an assignment is late, its final letter grade will receive one-third of a deduction. These deductions are cumulative: if your first draft and final draft are late by a day each, two-thirds of a letter grade will be deducted from the final grade for that assignment. Notify me in class or by email if an assignment will be submitted late. I am willing to discuss extensions in the case of extenuating circumstances, but I cannot guarantee an extension. If you wish to request an extension, see me after class, come to my office, or email me, preferably at the earliest possible moment. Incomplete drafts will be considered late papers, and deductions will accumulate until you submit a complete draft. Short in-class writing assignments and bCourses posts may not be made up and will not be accepted late.Participation: This is a discussion- and workshop-driven course. It is not a lecture course. We must all come to class having completed the assigned reading and prepared to participate actively in discussion and activities. Forms of participation include
responding to questions posed by the instructor or other students, posing questions for the class to consider, proposing passages for discussion, and volunteering to read aloud.  Pop quizzes may be given if there is an overall decline in participation. Group work and in-class peer review assignments also count toward your participation grade. We also ask that every student help foster an environment that makes full class participation possible. Friendly debates can be very productive, but everyone’s contribution deserves respect and consideration. Disrespect and hostility will not be tolerated.Attendance: Attendance will be taken every day in class. If you are not going to be in class, notify me by email to excuse the absence. Members of any groups that require school-related absences (athletes, musicians, etc.) should discuss their schedules with me by the end of the second week of class.Please note that only two absences may be excused. More than two excused absences, and any unexcused absences, will negatively impact your grade. Three late arrivals will equal one unexcused absence. If you are going to be consistently late (perhaps because
you have a class on the other side of campus), let me know by the end of the second week of class. Arriving more than twenty minutes late or leaving more than twenty minutes early will count as an absence unless you notify me beforehand. Five unexcused absences will put you in danger of failing the course.
Attendance is MANDATORY for the first two weeks of classes. Any student who does not attend all classes during this time period will likely be dropped from the class. After the first two weeks, students will be added from the waitlist. You must be on the
waitlist to be added to the class, and no student can be added after the end of the second week without permission from the department.Technology: In order to minimize distractions, laptop computers or any other kind of electronic devices (i-Pads, etc) are not permitted in the classroom. (Students who require a laptop for documented reasons are exempt from this prohibition, provided
that they supply me with proper documentation.) You will want to invest in a notebook and a pen or pencil for note taking.Office Hours: For help with papers, assignments, reading, or any other concerns, come see me during my regular office hours at  Dwinelle Hall, or schedule an appointment if you have a time conflict. Requests for an appointment should be sent in
advance, not the day before you desire to meet. Please arrive on the dot (not Berkeley time) for your appointment.Additional Help: Students may and are encouraged to consult the Student Learning Center for tutoring sessions. Ongoing tutoring sessions must be requested during the first two weeks of the semester; after the first two weeks, sessions are available by
appointment only. You can refer to the SLC’s website for further information: http://slc.berkeley.edu/general/index.htmStudents may also seek writing tutoring through the comparative literature student-tutoring program. See me for more information.Students with Disabilities: Please see me if you require special accommodations, either privately after class or in my office. The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for verifying that students have disability-related needs and
for planning appropriate accommodations in cooperation with the students themselves and student instructors. Students who need special arrangements (such as for evacuation) should request them from DSP: 230 César Chávez Student Center, 510-642-
0518 (voice) & 510-642-6376 (TTY), http://dsp.berkeley.edu/Academic Honesty: Assignments must be new material written specifically for this course. Recycling assignments from other courses is considered a form of cheating and will be treated accordingly.On Plagiarism:“Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example:• Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without acknowledgment.• Use of the views, opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment.• Paraphrasing of another person’s characteristic or original phraseology, metaphor or other literary device without acknowledgment.”(From the Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct from the Office of Student Conduct, http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp?id=1143&rcol=1201. Emphasis mine.)If you are at all confused about what constitutes plagiarism, please ask us.  “Accidental” plagiarism is still plagiarism and will be treated as such. If you are caught plagiarizing, you will receive an F for the work in question and may be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.Reading and Assignment Schedule:Date Reading Assignment Assignment Due Date

But the idea of traveling to study in a foreign country has long been crucial to the formation and education of students across time and cultural contexts. In this class we will think about the way that literature and film explore the experience of this course of study, and together we will investigate some of the issues, problems, and pleasures that arise from studying abroad. Some of the questions that will shape our semester include:  How does identity become defined or suppressed in relation to a new cultural and linguistic experience?    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17254

																	COMP LIT R1B.12Point of View: Critical Thinking through FictionTuTh 4-5:30pm205 DwinelleGSIs: Maya Kronfeld       mayak@berkeley.eduActive class participation is expected of all members of this class. This will be a discussion-oriented course, and you are expected to engage actively in our conversations, bearing in mind that class participation can take many forms, both in and beyond the classroom. Active listening, critical thinking, and careful note-taking are all productive forms of engagement during class, as are lively involvement in small-group work and thoughtful completion of in-class assignments. Careful reading and reflection on homework assignments and discussion in office hours are valuable forms of engagement outside of class hours. Get in the habit of marking up your texts with notes while you are reading– we will discuss more about what this means in class!One of our primary goals in this course is to become better critical readers. This requires a close engagement with the text, at the level of its content, language, and style. You are therefore expected to come to class having carefully read and reflected on the material for that day. This often means formulating questions, rather than answers. You will frequently be asked to come to class ready with a question about the text that you would like to pose to the rest of the class. Please bring all assigned texts for each day’s discussion to class with you.I will hold two hours of office hours per week, at a time TBA. If you have class during my office hours, you are free to e-mail me to make appointments for another time. Some of the best writing coaching can happen on a one-on-one basis, and you are strongly encouraged to use this opportunity to work on your writing, or to discuss aspects of the texts that we did not get a chance to cover in class.  Office hours meetings are especially helpful before you actually start writing a paper. One office hours meeting will be mandatory towards the beginning of the semester, to discuss your diagnostic essay.This is a writing intensive course. We will frequently devote class time to writing workshop sessions, in which we will discuss the various aspects of an interesting and persuasive analytical paper on a literary text, basic research skills, and the mechanics of writing. You will be responsible for writing a diagnostic paper (two to three pages), a first and final draft of a mid-term paper (five to six pages), and a final research paper (eight to nine page first draft, nine to ten page final draft). All assignments should be stapled, typed in Times New Roman, 12 pt font and double-spaced. First drafts will be marked with the grade they would have received had they been a final assignment, but only the grade on your final version will count towards your overall course grade. First drafts should be complete papers and should show the same level of thought and engagement that you would put into a graded final version. Failure to submit a first draft will result in a failing grade on the final version of the paper. We will spend considerable time revising paper drafts, and I expect to see significant improvement from first to final draft, not only at the level of writing but also at the level of ideas. Failure to adequately revise your paper will result in the final version receiving a lower grade than the provisional grade given for In addition to the graded papers, you will be expected to complete periodic short creative and
analytical writing assignments, both in and out of class. These are intended to improve the quality of our class discussion and your longer papers by encouraging careful critical thinking about our readings through less formal written engagement with the reading. Failure to complete these assignments thoughtfully will be reflected in your participation and homework grades.**The final research essay is due May 11th, 4:00PM in 4416 Dwinelle**In-class Close Reading presentationsStudents will be responsible for two collaborative in-class presentations:  Presentations will be short and informal (5-10 min each) and will be done with a partner. You will walk the class through your close reading of a (very) short passage from our literary text for that day.  You are expected to attend class regularly and on time. Every unexcused absence will result in a drop of one-third of a letter grade (e.g. from an A- to a B+) from your participation grade. Two unexcused tardies will count as one unexcused absence, and your grade will be adjusted accordingly. Your absence will be considered unexcused unless you notify me by email or in
person in advance of class. Only two absences with advance notification will be excused; any further absences will be considered unexcused unless accompanied by a doctor’s note.Attendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes. Roll will be taken every day during this period, for both regular and waitlisted students. Anyone who does not attend all classes during the first two weeks will be dropped from the class. At the end of the first and second week of classes, students will be added manually from the waitlist. If you are attempting to add this class and did not attend the first day, you will be expected to attend all class meetings thereafter and, if space permits, you will be allowed to enroll. No students will be added after the end of the second week of the term without permission from the Department. Students can only be added through the wait list.Homework (short writing assignments, presentations): 20%
Papers must be turned in at the beginning of class on the day on which they are due. For every calendar day that a paper is late, the final paper grade will be dropped by one-third of a letter grade, unless you’ve been granted a prior extension. This policy applies to both first and final drafts. If you will have to turn a paper in late because of extenuating circumstances, you must request permission at least 48 hours before the paper is due. The same rules regarding paper If you would like to continue improving a paper following the “final” draft, you are allowed to revise and resubmit all work but the final paper. You are strongly encouraged to consult with us before beginning to rewrite a paper, both to develop a plan for revision and to determine whether
it would instead be more beneficial to devote the time you would spend rewriting to your next paper. We will accept rewrites only on papers that have already shown significant revision and improvement from the first to final draft; if you do not engage substantially with the first round of required revision, you will not be allowed to resubmit the paper. Similarly, I will not accept
rewrites that reflect only cosmetic changes and do not show a serious revision and reworking of ideas. Rewrites are due within one week of receiving our comments and grade on the final draft of the paper. Please note that choosing to rewrite a paper does not guarantee that your grade will increase; the improvement must be significant enough to merit a higher grade.This is a discussion-based class, and its success will depend on the participation of each class member. In addition to being an active participant in our conversations, whether by introducing your own ideas, responding to a classmate’s comments, posing questions, or actively listening, you have the responsibility to engage respectfully with the ideas of your classmates and to help
create an atmosphere of friendly but rigorous critical engagement. Cell phones and laptops are not allowed in class. Your participation grade will be lowered by one-third of a letter grade every time we see you use your cell phone in class.“Plagiarism is defined as the use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example:

																	Writing Eros: Literature and Romantic LoveTu Th 5-6:30 pm
Jonathan Rowan (rowan@berkeley.edu) and Christopher Scott (scott.christopher@berkeley.edu; office 4319 Dwinelle)What is this thing we call “love”? Is it selfish or selfless (or somewhere in between)? Is it something we do, or something that happens to us? Is it merely a matter of emotion, or is rationality involved too? Does it always involve illusion—an idealized image of the beloved? How does literary form capture the experience of love?   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17263

																	—Bilbo BagginsInstructor: Keith Ford, keith.ford@berkeley.edu (office hours: Tuesdays 1:00pm to 3pm, and by appointment, at Dwinelle 4414). Before we even set out on a journey, the places we go are invested with meaning and, often, idealized goals. Inevitably, there is a dissonance between destination and dream. Perhaps accounting for this, in literature, many travelers are bound to entirely fictitious destinations. And yet, the fiction is as revealing as any fact when considering why we are driven to travel. What values and expectations does the traveler carry with him, perhaps unwittingly? How are indigenous populations represented? What are the social and political motivations surrounding the writing of travel texts?In order to investigate these and other questions, this course will engage with texts whose treatment of travel ranges from the fantastic (Lucian’s A True History and Apuleius’s The Golden Ass and selections from Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring) to the philosophical and imperial (Thomas More’s Utopia, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, selections from both Thevet’s Singularities of Antarctic France and Lery’s True Voyage to Brazil,) to something foundational to identity itself (Momaday’s The Way to Rainy Mountain, Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks and Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children).This is a reading and writing intensive course with several essay assignments which will build upon the skills acquired in R1A. We will approach academic writing as a process, and
students will articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying
while entering the world of literary criticism and learning to integrate and interrogate
criticism in their own writing.Assignments & Grading:

Professor Anne-Lise FrancoisThis course will offer a comparative introduction to lyric poetry across different linguistic traditions (including poems originally composed in Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese and Spanish). While we may consider different definitions and origin stories of the lyric genre–as muted song, verbal picture, overheard speech, or emotive expression–our main focus will be on learning how to read and write about poetry in its shorter forms. You will be encouraged to read in the original when possible, but all readings will be provided in English.Poetry by Sappho, Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Bashō, Shiki, Keats, Baudelaire, Dickinson, Rilke, Lorca, Bishop, and Niedecker, among others.Course Catalog Number: 17284

We will read fictional works by such authors as Shakespeare, Cervantes, More, Montaigne, Camoens, and Rabelais, in dialogue with writings of the sailors, missionaries, cartographers, scoundrels, and traders who expanded the limits of the European imagination with their accounts of “unknown” territory. In addition to reading a number of influential literary texts, we will work with primary historical material by studying maps, images, and collections of “curiosities.” Among the questions we will ask: how does the expansion of territory generate new forms of literary representation? How can you describe an object that has never been written about? How is a narrative like a map? Reading list:Rabelais: Gargantua and Pantagruel, trans. Screech (Penguin).

Maria KotzamanidouThis course will examine the work of Greek intellectuals (philosophers and literary writers) who, as adults, in moments of Greek historical and political crises, left Greece and emigrated to other European countries. The primary corpus of the work of these authors was written in the languages of their adopted countries, thus, allowing them to make major contributions to the specific intellectual life of those countries and to European letters in general. Even though these writers have appeared in Greece only in Greek translation, it will be interesting to examine to what extend each crisis, which drove them away from their original homeland, contributed to their evolution, and defined the direction of their ideas abroad.All materials from foreign languages for this course are presented in English translation.Greek History, theory and criticism are in English.

Professor Dora Zhang“Well – what remains to be written after that?” wondered Virginia Woolf in a 1922 letter about Marcel Proust’s monumental seven-volume work, In Search of Lost Time. Chronicling everything from the strangeness of kissing to the casual cruelties of snobbery, Proust’s novel conducts a vast and searching inquiry into the nooks and crannies of human experience. At the same time, it’s an unflinching account of a particular era, as the glittering decadence of belle époque Paris gave way to the horrors to the First World War, and rapidly changing modern life came to include new inventions like the telephone, the automobile, and the cinema.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17317

How do certain novels acquire the resources to produce sociological forms of knowledge, to encourage sociological forms of attention?  In particular, what aesthetic practices and what features of novelistic form contribute to this kind of knowledge production? What critical frameworks allow us to perceive this aspect of the representational work that novels do?  We will use a series of American, French, and English novels to pursue these questions, reading in tandem with them a variety of sociological works, including work by Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Marx, Lukács, Bourdieu, and Goffman, as well as some recent literary criticism.Novels:  Cooper, The Last of the Mohicans;  Balzac, Old Man Goriot; Eliot, Daniel Deronda; Proust, Sodom and Gomorrah;  Woolf, To the Lighthouse; Cather, The Professor’s House Course Catalog Number: 17371

Professor Chana KronfeldThis seminar will focus on lyrical poetry produced in the margins – or outside — of the modern Anglo-European canon in order to call into question static typological theories of genre, as well as the majoritarian, heteronormative or Eurocentric set of biases behind contemporary attacks on the lyric as solipsistic, apolitical “personal expression.” Participants will draw on their own cultural and linguistic specialties to help us compile a multi-lingual course Reader of modern lyrical poetry decentered by ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, class, place or language. My own contribution to the readings will include selections from modern Yiddish and Hebrew poetry, and examples of biblical poetry as an alternative model for the lyric, in which the very distinction between the personal and the collective, the political and the “apolitical” is rendered meaningless. Through a series of historically and linguistically informed close readings, we will examine both standard and non-normative theoretical studies of the lyric, maintaining a critical awareness of the extent to which our paradigm examples affect our understanding of the genre. Questions we may want to ask include: How does the view from the margins problematize such western commonplaces as the coherence and authority of the lyrical “I,” the subject-object divide, the dichotomy between apostrophe and address, the conflation of the “lyrical” and “subjective” with the “feminine,” or the lyric’s purported freedom — or flight! — from the historical and the social?Reading List:The Lyric Theory Reader: A Critical Anthology, edited by Virginia Jackson and Yopi Prins (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2014)Course Reader (to include Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Jacob Blevins, Jonathan Culler, Benjamin Harshav, Virginia Jackson, Barbara Johnson, Roman Jakobson, Robert Kaufman, Will Waters, Rene Wellek and selections by seminar participants)Selections from: The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse (bilingual anthology), eds.

Professors Mia Fuller (Italian Studies) and Harsha Ram (Slavic Languages and Literatures, Comparative Literature)Literature and urban civilization have long been intimately connected. Our seminar seeks to explore their connection as it relates to the emergence and global spread of the modern and contemporary city. How has the spatial and social organization of the modern city informed the thematic and formal choices writers make? And how, in turn, have the imaginative projections of literary texts shaped our experience of the city, its emancipatory potential and its alienating constraints? How exactly do cities get not merely mapped but also emplotted? What kinds of urban spaces and city-dwellers become the privileged focus of modern fiction and poetry? How do the density and scale of the urban built environment impinge on the way writers view the world and tell their stories? What genres seem best suited to rendering urban life? Is the city the defining context of modern literature or its implicit if barely human hero? To what extent is the global diffusion of the novel form related to the growth of urbanization?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17383

PLEASE NOTE: This course may be taken as a one-unit course (CC 17392), meeting in four consecutive sessions with Beatriz Sarlo on Nov. 9, 16, 23, 30, or as a two-unit course (CC 17395) meeting a total of eight sessions, 4 with Francine Masiello and 4 with Beatriz Sarlo.The course will examine the discourse on travel as a way to account for different symbolic, political, social, and ethnic experiences. We will begin with the assertion of travel literature as an “objective” form of autobiographical and of scientific research, and then break down the model. Readings will integrate theoretical accounts of travel from major Latin American authors, among them the 19th century Sarmiento and the 20th century Victoria Ocampo. These examples will help develop an inquiry about tourism especially in its comparative manifestations–as entertainment and distraction for a mass public or as an inquiry for a lettered elite who prevailed upon travel accounts to advance a national project at home. Texts will include professionally written narratives as well as postcards, letters, and visual records from the 19th through 21st centuries.
Readings selected for each meeting include classical travel studies and contemporary reflections. The material should work as an introduction to travel writing and may suggest further ways of considering it in terms of place, time, and mobility. Discussion topics will cover a wide range and will include: Writing and painting spaces; The politician as exile and the idéologue as traveler; When music travels, jazz in Buenos Aires and tango on Broadway.Beatriz Sarlo is a scholar of Latin American literature and culture and one of the most important Argentine literary and cultural critics of the last 40 years. She has been a Professor at the University of Buenos Aires and has held Visiting Professorships throughout Europe and the U.S. A public intellectual, Sarlo is the author of more than two dozen books on literary criticism, cultural history, visual culture, and politics.Francine Masiello is Sidney and Margaret Ancker Distinguished Professor in the Humanities in the Departments of Spanish and Portuguese & Comparative Literature.For more information or a complete syllabus, contact Teresa Stojkov, Associate Director, Townsend Center: tstojkov@berkeley.edu or visit townsendcenter.berkeley.edu.Course Catalog Number: 17392

																	The ongoing production of Hollywood films set at sea suggests that even in today’s age of mass air travel and instantaneous global communication, we still hunger for a good tale of ocean adventure. What accounts for the lasting resonance of the age-old association of sea travel with adventure and of seamen (and women) with the telling of tall tales? What is the singular relationship between the openness and remoteness of the sea and the unbridling of imagination and suspension of disbelief that make fiction work? In this course, we will draw on a wide range of genres and literary traditions to consider the sea as an imaginary space, one vast enough to encompass tall tales and sea yarns, but also colonial histories and the oscillations of modern identities and consciousnesses.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 34223

																	In this course we will explore various word-and-image partnerships (and rivalries). We will consider early artists’ books such as William Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience, ekphrasis (that is, vivid visual description) in Classical poetry, and contemporary comic books and graphic novels. Homer will show us how well words can paint a picture, while editorial cartoonists will illustrate how images alone can convey a story. In order to understand these texts better, both as verbal and visual narratives, we will read pertinent theoretical work (W.J.T. Mitchell, Erwin Panofsky) and we will consider what distinguishes text from image, their respective “traditional” purposes, and areas of overlap between their usual functions.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14161

																	Disease attacks the interior and exterior of the human body, presenting psychological and emotional bifurcations of self. Contagious diseases (especially if little understood) can pose a radical challenge to families, caretakers, and governing structures. Pandemics have often been perceived as a moral condemnation of human depravity, yet they have in turn engendered some of the brightest examples of human virtue. This course will explore various works concerning plagues that have visited us in recent history, and those qualities in ourselves that threaten to plague a healthy society.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 34314

																	A recent book of literary criticism on nature poetry by John Felstiner bears the title Can Poetry Save the Earth? Without taking a positon on Felstiner’s urgent question, this course will be structured around a series of questions implicit within it: What effects does reading about nature, or looking at visual representations of the natural world, have on our experience of our physical surroundings and our encounters with nonhuman forms of life? Does nature poetry and landscape painting (or nature photography) intensify our experience of nature’s aliveness and beauty and mystery, deepening our feeling of connection to it? Does the mode of sustained attention and imaginative participation specific to the study of literature and art carry over in some significant way to our perception and appreciation of the natural world? What distinguishes literary and aesthetic engagements with the natural world from other forms of discourse such as scientific and activist writing?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 34315

																	We are seldom conscious of how mediated our relationship to the world is as we make our way through it. This mediation occurs not just on the level of conceptual cognition, but also on the level of embodiment and sensual perception. In this course we will analyze the ways in which different genres of literature engage with and interrogate the status of the physical body and its senses. For example, what roles can the body play in contributing to the narrative form of a novel or short story? Or, what can poetry tell us about the significance and limits of sensual experience while making appeals to our senses as we read it?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14171

Be it in daily communication, lawful jurisdiction, or the figurative worlds of the literary, whether instructing or indoctrinating, exalting or exacting, how do words play on worlds? As often as words bewitch us, conjuring by artifice, so too do words fail us, distorting by approximation. How does language ring true, and how does language lie? And what of words across languages, when words cross borders? What shrinks or swells, what is lost or found in translation? These are but a few of the questions this course will address—you can take my word for it.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14172

Does the revelation lead to crisis? Chaos? Resolution? With some of our stories, the reader alone learns a character’s secret, while the story’s other characters remain in the dark. What kind of “revelation” is this? How does the possession of this secret knowledge affect a reader’s attitude toward the character and the story’s events? How do these secrets alter or contradict our notions of family? How do the ideas of family and kinship change over time and across distance?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14173

The works and authors we will read in this course help us think about the ways this history is transmitted, codified and remembered. They ask us, as readers of these texts, to reexamine the history we think we know. Storytelling in the Americas thus acts as a means of rewriting history, thereby opening up the spaces for previously unheard voices to appear and exist.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14174

																	Even as economic pressures and modern technology lead young people to move further and further from the places they grew up, we remain attached to the myth of the family home. The home, we are told, is the nurturing and comfortable space to which we can always return. Even (or especially) when we’ve left it, the family hearth continues to promise a refuge from the wider world. Yet literature and film are replete with another sort of home: isolated but never totally private, familiar but never completely safe.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14176

In the texts we read, cross-cultural encounters resound in different historical, linguistic and literary registers. The texts at once dramatize and participate in identity formations during a variety of periods, including colonial Mexico and interwar Poland. We examine principles of “translation” and the reciprocal relationship between language and culture. What are the special capabilities and limitations of literature in meaning transfer across cultures? How do we interpret and communicate the selective permeability of transcultural encounters? How do these texts challenge or complicate our own understanding of cultural exchange?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14177

																	Tales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? How do competing twentieth-century empires (such as those in Japan, China, and Britain) conceive of themselves — and of one another — differently? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14113

Why is it that we get nothing from reading a book one year and get a whole world from reading the same book another year? Why it is that sometimes we find a work (of literature, of poetry, of film, of art) at exactly the right moment in our lives when we are most receptive to it? On the contrary, why do some works of art never speak to us, or arrive untimely, before or after we need them? Who do we trust to help us see what a work of art offers? How do we decide this? What is the value of reading, reading hard, into something? How do you do it?

Straddling the porous border between here and there, past and present, death and life, the undead, or not-quite dead, figures that populate our readings challenge us to rethink the linear unfolding of time. Ghosts, vampires, and zombies: these are the supernatural forces that we’ll encounter this semester.

								Why do people write long novels, and why do people read them? We will look for answers in three different places: in George Eliot’s Middlemarch, in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Idiot, and in selections from Marcel Proust’s seven-volume novel In Search of Lost Time. Eliot and Dostoevsky had different ambitions as novelists. Middlemarch and The Idiot were written around the same time, but they come from different traditions (English and Russian) and have astonishingly different aims. Our goal will be to figure out what Eliot and Dostoevsky were using novel-writing to do, and why their undertakings required such length. Proust loved the novels of Eliot and Dostoevsky. He named The Idiot the most beautiful novel he ever read. When he wrote his own novel, he outdid both Eliot and Dostoevsky in length.   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14150

This is the time of migrations from the South to the North, of exile and off-shore displacements through which American artists and writers stretched the boundaries of their local towns to open a world conversation about art and, never on the side, about race and gender. This is the debut of an avant-garde in music and literature, of radical experiments with poetry and performance; it signals the rise of new technologies, especially radio and film.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 32395

More specifically, we will be looking at how such family crises enable and generate narratives, but also perturb them; how subjects are constituted and deconstructed through descent groups; how the crisis of patrilinearity can become an emblem in literary texts for other cultural crises; and how this theme intersects with the issues of gender and race. Course requirements include three short writing assignments and a final paper based on an oral presentation of a text chosen by the student and read outside of class. Our reading will embrace both literary texts and theoretical/critical discussions of them.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14100

We will also pay some attention to the development of the children’s literature industry in the United States and to the current state of children’s publishing.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 31578

								The onset of modernization in Greek society, after the War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire, albeit a belated one, brought about an increased contact with, and an imitation of, different European cultures. It also brought about an accelerated movement toward secularization. Earlier, the secular ideological ground for the War of Independence which was reflected in the writings of Rigas Velestilis (Pheraios), at the end of the eighteenth century, and Hellenic Rule of Law: A Discourse on Freedom, written anonymously, under obvious French influence, and published in Italy in 1806, envisioned the secular society that was supposed to emerge at the war’s end.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14052

								It’s been said that poetry is what is untranslatable, yet one poem often translates another, and many of us only read one another’s languages in translation. As a catch-all concept for whatever “out there” can’t quite be captured in human terms, “Nature” can also be thought of as a language only ever encountered in translation. In this senior seminar we will explore the complex relationships between these three shape-shifting terms–“poetry,” “nature,” “translation”–as we read together poems and essays from various linguistic traditions, including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. Each of you will be responsible for a poet in the language in which you are working.

								Romanticism was once defined as a turn toward “nature” in response to the industrialization marking Western Europe’s transition to modern capitalism in the early nineteenth century.  Rather than simply resurrecting the idea of the Romantic poets as “nature” poets, we will carefully examine Romantic figures of reflection and grounding, dispersal and dwelling, while also searching for alternatives to the curative role often assigned both “nature” and “poetry” in environmentalist criticism.  Topics will include: the gendering of “nature”; the persistence of commoning practices within industrial modernity; agriculture as a border-space between “culture” and “nature”; the role of memory and imagination in the sense of place and the loss of place; weather-reporting, plant-study and other practices of attention; fantasies about ecological disaster, social catastrophe, and science’s ability to save or destroy humankind.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 31595

The focus will be on novel reading – Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Pnin and perhaps Lolita – and on texts where crime, judgment and punishment assume particular procedural, narrative, moral or metafictive importance. We will pay particular attention to the themes of transgression, healing and vengeance and how they play out in legal and metafictive contexts. We will discuss cases where ethics and aesthetics pull in opposite directions – where bad or even good writing can be a crime. Dostoevsky’s legal commentaries – the Kornilova and Kairova cases – will also be addressed.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 31617

We’ll discuss a variety of approaches to the theory of translation, from system theory to postcolonial and globalization studies, both by reading critically and by theorizing from the translation practice itself. Central issues will include the role of translation in the construction of national and transnational literary histories, (un)equal power relations in the circulation between source and target text, recovering the role of agency in translation, and translation as intertextual practice.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 31610

								A Mini-Course and Residency with Christopher Bollas at the Townsend Center for the HumanitiesThe seminar and residency will explore the work of the most influential psychoanalyst writing in English today, Christopher Bollas, who will be scholar-in-residence at the Townsend Center in the first week of November 2016. Bollas is widely known for his pioneering, polymathic, and maverick investigations of unconscious perception of objects and the object world, including human beings—work that has been highly suggestive for many domains of the humanities and social sciences—and more recently for his exploration of fractured unconsciousness (anxiety, hysteria, breakdown, and schizophrenia). Prior to Bollas’s visit, we will discuss his published works (including The Freudian Moment, The Shadow of the Object, Being a Character, and When the Sun Bursts: The Enigma of Schizophrenia) as well as forthcoming and in-progress work that he will provide. Students will present their own projects to the group, and will develop questions to be tabled for seminars with Bollas himself and for one-on-one meetings with him during his residency.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 14115

David WalterThis course focuses on the mechanics of storytelling and the way successful storytellers go beyond craft to create a living work of art. We will examine classic attempts to say what makes a good story and analyze strategies that writers, dramatists, and filmmakers use to draw in their readers. Students will be introduced to the concept of the genre and will be asked to put to the test the idea that each genre has certain “rules” that make it successful. Readings will include the drama of Sophocles and August Wilson, stories by Boccaccio, Diderot, Dinesen and O’Connor, and films by Wilder and Polansky.Course Catalog Number:

S. Chihaya and J. CreweWhile childhood and its attendant joys often provide the focus for works of literature and film, this course will turn to a darker image – that of the child in crisis. The texts we will examine place young protagonists in situations of intense strain and stress, with a particular focus on the child in the midst of war and national upheaval. The questions that surround these issues are many and varied: why do authors choose to focus on children and childhood in these works, especially those intended for adult audiences? What is it about the figure of the child that allows us, as adult readers and viewers, to view problematic historical moments with such clarity? How might the child protagonist serve as a focus for our own insecurities and fears – and alternately, as a possible source of hope or optimism? Over the course of the semester, we will explore these questions (and more) in depth through discussion and written analysis.Texts will include:Pan’s Labyrinth, dir. Guillermo del ToroNorthanger Abbey, Jane AustenSelections from Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, William BlakeGrave of the Fireflies, Akiyuki Nosaka (with film, dir.

Ruth LorenzThis course will give you a taste of one of the most enduring debates surrounding literary fictions while also providing a solid introduction to analytical thinking and writing. The texts we’ll be reading, drawn from the English, Russian, German and Classical Greek traditions, will offer arguments and experiments that explore what happens when literature aspires to represent reality—whatever “reality” might be. Does fiction decieve readers or enlighten them? Does it cater to our preconceived notions or challenge them? What distortions are embedded in the literary reflection? We will explore these questions and more in readings and class discussions. These discussions will in turn be the backdrop to a sustained examination of the skills involved in writing argumentative essays. The course will offer direction in how to generate an argument, how to structure a paper and how to express yourself with clarity. You will leave the course with more insight into the truths and lies of fiction and with a honed ability to write elegantly and effectively.Texts will include:Plato, The Republic (selections)Aristotle, PoeticsTurgenev, Fathers and SonsBrecht, Life of GalieiWoolf, Mrs. DallowayBarthes, S/Z (selections)Course Catalog Number:

Gina ZupsichI. COURSE DESCRIPTION:Murder, sorcery, betrayal, suicide, adultery… These are a few of the charges brought against the female figures that we will study in this course. Opening up the term crime as broadly as possible, we will attempt to answer a range of questions about the relationship between women and crime. What is a woman’s crime? Are women particularly prone to crime? Is it a crime to be a woman?Looking at various narratives of criminal women, we will investigate the cultural, social and political conditions of women’s existence that inform their transgressive behavior. Our texts include novels, short stories, film, and gender theory that deal with delinquent women of diverse classes, races, cultures and occupations. We will examine how literature itself criminalizes and decriminalizes women, including retellings of infamous criminal women such as Tituba, a witch from Arthur Miller’s Crucible and Charlotte Bronte’s madwoman from Jane Eyre, who tell “their” side of the story.R1B is a continuation of college-level argumentative writing with an aim to develop more advanced writing skills based on literary critique and basic research. In the first week of class, you will write a 3-page essay that will help identify specific areas of writing for you to improve. You will write two 7-8-page essays on the course reading that  includes independent research outside of class. Our focus will be to practice the step-by-step process of writing from brainstorming to argumentation and revision. Class discussions are a vital part of this process as a way to focus critical themes and develop literary analytical skills.II.

Jason Bodik“My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel–it is, above all, to make you see. That—and no more, and it is everything.”—Joseph ConradIn this course we will be reading and discussing a number of texts that concern themselves with questions of perception. How does a lyric poem allow us to see or feel something we’ve never directly experienced? How does the ability or inability clearly to see and understand a state of affairs affect the plight of a character, or the conflicts around which a plot revolves? Is language, though a verbal phenomenon, able somehow to change the way we perceive in our actual lives? If so, what types of real-world power does this ability imply for literature, and what light can it shed on the controversies that surround so many literary texts? Through wide-ranging in-class discussion and frequent writing assignments, we will explore these and other questions over the course of the semester.Readings:Sophocles, Oedipus RexWilliam Shakespeare, MacbethArthur Rimbaud, A Season in HellRichard Wright, Native SonMarguerite Duras, The LoverJorge Luis Borges, “Tlon, Ukbar, Orbis Tertius”Nikolai Gogol, “The Overcoat”Clarice Lispecter, “Journey to Petropolis”We will also be reading a number of shorter poems by authors including, but not limited to: Elizabeth Bishop, William Blake, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Pablo Neruda, Ezra Pound, Cathy Song, and W.

Nina PickIn this course we will consider the relationship between literature and psychoanalysis. Privileging praxis as well as theory, we will lurk in the library, eavesdrop in the analyst’s office, and peer into the bedroom to examine the various positions, practices and repercussions of psychoanalytic thought. Our project will be to read psychoanalytic texts as literature and, conversely, to read literature through or against a psychoanalytic framework, focusing on texts that explicitly exhibit a psychoanalytic engagement or critique. We will survey some of Freud’s key theories—on love, dream interpretation, hysteria, etc.—, and simultaneously we will read Freud reading: what was he reading, and how? We will examine both the myths at the foundation of Freud’s writing and the continuing momentous aftershocks of his theories: the creation and dissemination of new cultural mythology; the waves of resistance, criticism, disavowal, and dismissal. What were the driving myths for Freud? And what are the myths that drive us?To explore these questions, we will follow the Oedipus myth from Sophocles’ classical play, Oedipus Rex, to the post-modern play (in the other sense of the word) of Deleuze and Guattari’s schizophrenic Anti-Oedipus, Nabokov’s other family romance, and the paranoiac quest of Pynchon’s Oedipa Maas. How does the Oedipus myth continue to resonate in contemporary considerations of self and relationship? We will linger in the places in Freud’s theories that strike us as undertheorized, dissatisfying or provocative, to examine the ways post-Freudian criticism builds upon or dismisses Freud, specifically in its conceptions of female and/or queer desire. And finally we will look at how other genres—the novel, poetry, drama and film—perform their own powerful theorization.Texts will include the following (please wait to buy until after the first day of class):Sophocles, The Oedipus CyclePeter Gay, The Freud ReaderWilliam Shakespeare, HamletJuan Rulfo, Pedro PáramoVladimir Nabokov, LolitaPeter Shaffer, EquusThomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49Course reader and/or class handouts will include:Excerpts from Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus, Franz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks, Teresa de Lauretis’ The Practice of Love, and selections from Carl Jung and Adrienne Rich.Course Catalog Number: 17224

Suzanne Scala and Jessie HockEncrusted with history and heedlessly modern, intimate mental landscapes and sites of anonymous dehumanization, cities have been a favorite topic of writers at least since Plato wrote his Republic. In this course, we will focus on the role of the city in literature and film. Can a city function as another character in a novel? Can it be a “psychical entity,” as Freud called Rome? Why have so many authors created imaginary cities? In film, what is the interplay between the city as the location of the action and the action itself? Could Lost in Translation, for example, take place anywhere but Tokyo?Course Catalog Number: 17227

Jennifer Lillie and Adeline TranWhat is advantageous about the vantage point offered from outside the healthy, the normal, the mainstream, the acceptable, the recognized? This course will focus on short stories, novels, and films about outsider figures: geniuses, patients, loners, inmates, hermits, outcasts, foreigners, etc. In doing so, we will also consider the (de)normalizing effect of the creative process and insider status as an inhibitor and/or facilitator of that process. We will also explore our own privileged outsider status as critical writers. A heavy load of writing assignments will emphasize how to assume a critical (as opposed to a moral or purely aesthetic/affective) stance and how to make a logically coherent literary argument.Readings: Selections from Don Quixote, Graham Greene’s The Quiet American, J.

Amanda Goldstein and Margarita Zaydman Though they seemed to lay bare the workings of so much of the natural universe, Newton’s  Principia famously declined to posit a cause, physical or metaphysical, for the gravitational attraction at work between bodies separated in space.  Over the following century, meanwhile, the distance between literature and science grew to define increasingly separate means of observing and representing the world. This course seeks to hone your critical reading and writing skills through the examination of literary, philosophical, scientific, and category-defying texts (from early to very recent modernity) that take up physics’ problem of action-at-a-distance. How, in these works, do forces of sympathy, similarity, memory, writing, or desire assume the capacity to move without touching? Are there influences that operate across distances in time, as well in space? How do our texts depict the medium (physical or otherwise) through which a delayed, waylaid, or mislaid “action” might pass?The fictions, poems, essays and films we will be discussing here present situations where the difference between cause and effect, action and reaction, break down: they will provoke us to ask just what kind of an action “looking-on” might be; how ideas might work as contagiously as germs; how war and violence can happen by remote-control; and how different genres, such as elegies or odes, engage their absent and present objects. Meanwhile, our emphasis on critical reading and writing will entangle us in new problems of distance and proximity. And although the notion of “action”  will be called routinely into question, it is clear that our class will require your active participation and preparation on several fronts: attentive reading before class and thoughtful contributions to discussion when we meet; writing and revising several essays; presenting a midterm multimedia group project; and preparing short, written homework assignments to be shared on bSpace or in class.

Jeffrey Weiner & Gregory BonettiThis course examines a term, “conversion,” in its religious context, and also in the areas of sexuality, ideological discourse, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.  We begin by reading Socrates’ account of the potential for poets to influence fantasy and desires, so that we may assess the extent to which art can produce a “conversion.”  From Ovid’s tales of unwilling transformation in the Metamorphoses and Shakespeare’s treatment of the subject in The Tempest, we go on to the Biblical accounts of religious conversion.  Why and in what context does a person choose to convert from one set of beliefs and one state of being to another?  What kinds of transformations occur in the subject and in her social context?  How is individual conversion threatening to the social and cultural status quo?  We will be looking closely at the roles of desire, fantasy, absence, and presence in the conversion of literary characters through the works of St. Perpetua, Ignatius of Loyola, Molière, and Cervantes.  We will also consider how the dream of the cultural Other’s conversion plays into our own fantasies.While we will always keep in mind the text’s role in converting the reader, we will focus increasingly on this function in more explicitly ideological works.  We will read Orwell’s Animal Farm and Collodi’s allegorical conversion of Pinocchio, as well as the aestheticized, psychological conversion in The Picture of Dorian Gray.  Holleran’s novel about gay culture in the late 1970s opens the way for a group conversation about the insistent role of sex, music, and dance as sources of individual and communal conversion.  We will listen to and analyze some of the most important disco anthems in this context.  The course continues with an exploration of the function of the text in converting a resistant audience through the Belgian film about a cross-dressing child in a bourgeois family, Ma Vie en Rose.  Finally, we will theorize about the possibilities for extending the term conversion to “sero-conversion,” meaning to become HIV-positive.  The movie adaptation of Kushner’s Angels in America will give us an opportunity to play again with the ideas of desire, fantasy, and communal resistance in the context of the “forced conversion” of HIV-positive people.  As the film’s audience, we are invited to undergo a “conversion” in our thoughts about disease, blame, and communal responsibility.Whether they are explicitly religious, ideological, or aesthetic, we will imagine all discourses of conversion as playing with similar kinds of desires, fantasies, and issues of agency between text and reader in the attempt to transform the individual and society.Readings will include most of the following:Texts:D’Aurevilley, Barbey “A Woman’s Revenge” from Les DiaboliquesBible, selections form the Gospels and Book of ActsCervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, excerpts from Don Quixote and Exemplary NovelsCollodi, Carlo, excerpts from The Adventures of PinocchioHolleran, Andrew, chapters from Dancer from the DanceHuysmans, J.-K., À reboursLoyola, Ignatius, excerpts from Spiritual ExercisesMolière, Dom JuanOrwell, George, Animal FarmOvid, excerpts from The MetamorphosesPamphili, Eusebius, excerpts from Church History and Life of ConstantinePerpetua, The Passion of St. Perpetua, St. Felicitas, and their CompanionsPlato, excerpt from The RepublicShakespeare, The TempestWilde, Oscar, excerpts from The Picture of Dorian Gray Films:Angels in America (Nichols 2003)Ma Vie en Rose (Berliner 1997)Music:Selections from the disco era (1973-1981)Course Catalog Number: 17236

Jordan Bulger and Sydney CochranIn this course we will investigate the imaginative worlds of literature and visual art, exploring what they teach us about the nature and experience of happiness. We will discuss the emotions of such perversely isolated individuals as Melville’s Bartleby, who chooses not to engage with the world around him, and such morally questionable characters as Nabokov’s Humbert Humbert, whose love both sustains and deceives him. We will consider what it means for Gregor, in Kafka’s Metamorphosis, to find himself a stranger to his own skin; what the characters gain in Aristophanes’ Women at the Thesmophoria as they dress in drag and create identity through costume; and how two African American women, in Larsen’s Passing, struggle to understand the meaning of race in a society that sees only in black and white. What emotions do these experiences bring forward and what happiness, if any, is available to each character?Beyond culling examples of happiness from these texts and others, we will examine how each work’s respective style and form add to our understanding of the emotions involved in these experiences. A love poem and a romantic movie may both reveal the joys of passionate love, but in what ways do their respective media (poetry versus film) and
the artistic options available to each medium shape our comprehension and appreciation of love? We will consider too how fiction, as opposed to other forms of expression, has unique mechanisms for conveying and exploring emotion. How might a novel teach us about happiness, for instance, in different ways than a psychology book?  When we read fiction critically, furthermore, we explore on dead paper a world of characters whose choices, whether they lead to
disappointment or to triumph, invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and choices. While focusing on what it means to be happy in work and in love, in our communities and with our bodies, we will also strive to gain new power in expressing our ideas and observations with clarity and good argument. Whether happily or unhappily, you will write several research papers in this course, in addition to shorter writing assignments, designed to develop your reading, writing, researching, thinking, and even your living skills to their fullest potential.Principal Texts:Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov

Allen Young“You taught me language, and my profit on’tIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you,For learning me your language.”Deprived of his land and his language, Caliban, in Shakespeare’s The Tempest, can denounce his enslavement only in the words of his master. The play is often read as an allegory of the conquest of the New World, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it has long served to frame discussions of cultural and intellectual relations across the Atlantic.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number:

Adam RzepkaThis course explores the history of escapes from history, focusing on constellations of texts that perform radical critiques of existing social worlds by imagining radical departures from them.  We will track the astonishingly diverse lineage of the utopian imagination, from ancient accounts of the Isles of the Blessed to the manifestos of contemporary anarchist enclaves.  We will examine the generic and political transformations that drive the darkening of that imagination as the specter of dystopia emerges from within utopia and begins to subsume it.  Along the way, we will also consider a number of ‘xtopic’ fictions that defy the utopia/dystopia binary—the nonsensical maps and languages of Lewis Carroll’s Alice books, for example.Our guiding questions throughout the course will be about the ways in which discourse is turned and stretched in experiments with space and time.  How, for instance, do sharply contested social and political topics in a specific historical period translate into topographies for societies that are intended to be timeless?  What impact does utopian removal have on the languages spoken by utopian subjects?  Why does resistance within totalitarian dystopias so often begin as a kind of remembering?  Where do we stand as historical readers when we engage with texts that envision a future society located in what is now our present?Major readings: Plato, The Republic; More, Utopia; Shakespeare, The Tempest; Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass; Kafka, The Castle; Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four; Gibson, Neuromancer. Shorter readings may include: Selections from Hesiod, Pindar, Virgil, and Horace; selected Renaissance travelers’ pamphlets; Defoe, “Of Captain Mission”; chapters from Thoreau, Walden; chapters from Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture; De Certeau, “Walking in the City”; Debord, “Theory of the Dérive”; Foucault, “Panopticism”; Jameson, “The Desire Called Utopia”; Hakim Bey, “The Temporary Autonomous Zone”; selected late-twentieth century manifestos. Films: Lang, MetropolisMarker, La jetéeCourse Catalog Number:

Luis RamosThis course takes as its object of reflection a question Gustavo Pérez Firmat nearly two decades ago posed:  Do the Americas share a common literature? That is, do the two Americas—north and south, continental and insular, polar and equatorial—share textual common ground? If so, what similar literary strategies and common critical concerns might such an ensemble of texts bring to the fore? This course takes up these questions from a historical—and materialist—perspective; that is, from one that views history (and by extension, literature) from the violent and traumatic conditions from which they both emerge. In so doing, however, we will not subscribe to a deterministic or defeatist view of either, but rather, to one wherein both emancipation and conquest, resistance and domination, dispossession and regeneration, are accounted for in equal measure. Students should expect not only to devise novel strategies of conceiving the relation between literary traditions typically understood as distinct, but moreover, to articulate previously unforeseen ways of thinking about the Americas as an expanded category of aesthetic and geopolitical thought. In keeping with the above aims, the course will be structured into four related units: The meaning of freedom and self-awareness in Anglo American and Spanish American republican thought (1); the imprint of slavery and diasporic identity in Afro Cuban and African American poetry (2); the legacies of conquest in Pueblo Indian and Mayan historical consciousness (3); and the histories of Chinese new world migration in Asian American and Cuban American fiction (4). Course Catalog Number:

Ulf OlssonAlready in classical antiquity, writers were being expelled from their native countries – and this continues even today. But exile might be chosen and voluntary, or forced, it might be an inner or an outer exile. Modern literature, in particular, displays different aspects of exile, and the development of modernist literature is closely related to different forms of exile. Many of the great, pioneering modernists performed their work in countries other than they were born in: James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Samuel Beckett… The interconnectedness of modernism, emigration, exile and the internationalization of literature is discussed in this course, as well as the importance of exile for the construction of self and identity, experiments in language and aesthetic renewal. Critical and theoretical key concepts that will be central to the course are inner and outer exile, voluntary and forced exile, modernism, world literature, experiments in language, and the construction of identity.Course Catalog Number:

Frank BeznerOften labelled as ‘courtly’ love, medieval love literature is of a rich, complex, and challenging variety: intellectuals write (in Latin) about the anxieties and traps related to falling in love; monks send their love poetry to nuns; French nobles negotiate power and dependency by writing abouth ‘their’ desire; professional singers create and perform highly dense literary fabrics about their unreachable lady; authors of romances explore the tensions between being a ruler and falling in love; mystics interpret (and write about) their religious experience as sensual love.Our course will explore this variety. In the first half we will closely read and compare a significant number of both ‘classic’ and less known Latin and vernacular love lyrics from the High Middle Ages: authors read include Baudri of Bourgeuil, Peter of Blois, Andreas Capellanus (Latin), William of Aquitaine, Marcabru, and Bertrand of Ventadorn (French), Heinrich of Morungen, Reinmar and Walther of the Vogelweide (German). In the second half we will mainly read and compare some medieval (Arthurian) narratives centered around the problem of love (Erec, Tristan), but at the end also discuss the fusion of religious lyrics and love lyrics.In reading and comparing these texts we will engage in literary analysis (form, imagery, recurrent elements, principal ideas, beginnings/ends, construction of a speaker/’I’, performance), explore the intersections of love literature and other discourses (medical, theological, legal), and discuss the relationship between our texts and the complex intellectual and social milieus in which they originated.Students must read at least one of the above languages, and a some knowledge of Latin is helpful, but not required. All texts will be available both in the original and in translation. Students must be willing to engage in intensive close reading and are expected to contribute actively to class.

Maria KotzamanidouThe purpose of this course is to present a broad selection of modern Greek short stories, from the last quarter of the nineteenth century through the last quarter of the twentieth, with a great range and variety in their style and focus. They range thematically, among others, from “ethographic fiction”, where customs and community loom large in the story, to the alienation of the individual and the anonymity of the urban space, to the psychological impact of the savagery of war, to idiosyncratic flights of individual imagination and states of the mind. The stories are arranged chronologically, in order to underscore the development of the genre, and are placed in a variety of contexts: literary, historical, social, psychological, political, economic.In the latter part of the nineteenth century, the increasing consciousness of Greece as a modern European nation intensified the efforts of writers and intellectuals to apply European literary standards to Greek fiction. These standards were gleaned from French, English, German and Russian translations of fiction which were published or serialized in newspapers and magazines. Thus, the modern Greek short story seems to have kept pace in its development with its European counterparts and, more recently, especially in the latter part of the twentieth century, with its North American ones.Unlike modern Greek poetry and the modern Greek novel, examples of which have circulated widely in foreign translation, the modern Greek short story, despite a few collections translated into foreign languages, remains virtually unknown outside Greece. As a genre, it has reflected, with a particular immediacy and sensitivity, the historical, social and intellectual climates that fostered it, and it has helped to highlight the contributions of women to contemporary literary culture.

What criteria for such a relationship seem necessary to contemporary readers and critics? How does the representation of thought and feeling influence our conception of fictional character? And how did other periods and cultures construe such problems? We will consider two significant trajectories: the Victorian to the modernist novel, and the late sixteenth to the eighteenth century Chinese novel. Primary texts include Henry James, The Golden Bowl; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; Vladmir Nabokov, Transparent Minds; the Plum in the Golden Vase (Jin Ping Mei); and Cao Xueqin, Story of the Stone (Hong lou meng); critics include Peter Brooks, Sharon Cameron, Dorrit Cohn, Lisa Freeman, Catherine Gallagher, Bill Brown, Eve Sedgwick, Blakey Vermeule, and traditional Chinese commentators.

Anne-Lise FrancoisWhat contribution does the study of Romanticism have to make to current critical discourses such as ecocriticism and biopolitics concerned with animal/human divides and the relationship between place, language and politics?  Romanticism was once defined as a turn toward “nature” in response to the industrialization marking Western Europe’s transition to modern capitalism in the early nineteenth century.  Rather than simply resurrecting the idea of Wordsworth and others as “nature” poets, we will carefully examine the relationships between discourse and experience,figure and origin in these writers, while also searching for alternatives to the salvific or curative role often assigned both “nature” and “poetry”in environmentalist criticism.  Topics will include: the gendering of “nature”; the conflict between “modernity” and “modernization” and the role of marginalized communities; agriculture as a border-space between “culture” and “nature”; the role of memory and imagination in writing about place and the loss of place; weather-reporting and other practices of attention; fantasies about ecological disaster, social catastrophe, and science’s ability to save or destroy humankind.   As we compare different definitions of “nature”—as a set of finite, exploitable resources, a normative authority limiting human experimentation, a repository of traditional ways of doing and knowing, and a site of vulnerability in need of protection from extinction—we will also explore the alternatives to the nature/human binary developed by the writers in question.  Our readings will traverse British, North American, German and French contexts and will include works by Rousseau, Schiller, Goethe, Coleridge, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Malthus, Percy and Mary Shelley, Clare, Keats,Thoreau, Freud, Adorno and Horkheimer.Course Catalog Number:

Michael LuceyIn this seminar we’ll be investigating a number of different topics, all of which will somehow, if we are lucky, meet up by the end of the semester:  What happens when you think of sexuality sociologically, as a set of categories and social forms that circulate through space and time? What happens when you think of literature also as a set of categories and social forms (genres, activities, patterns of response) and a set of works that circulate in particular patterns of their own, and  that produce meaning as much via their interrelations and their endurance in certain institutional contexts as by way of their own signifying?  How and why might sexuality come to be a particular topic of representation and investigation in a given literary field at a given time, and what that might mean, both literarily and sociologically?  How will different literary institutions cope with sexuality in literature? We will focus on literature from France between 1930 and 1970 (in particular texts by Colette, Genet, Leduc, Pinget), and in the course of our study we will consult a wide variety of classic sociological texts (Durkheim, Goffman, Bourdieu), some contemporary ethnographic work on sexuality and some recent work in linguistic anthropology, along with a variety of approaches to the aesthetic (in particular, the literary) object (including Dewey, Adorno,  Bourdieu).One book by Violette Leduc that we will be reading, Mad in Pursuit, is currently out of print, but there are used copies easily available on line, so interested students are encouraged to seek them out.  Other books that will be ordered include:  Colette, The Pure and the Impure, Jean Genet, Our Lady of the Flowers, Leduc, La Bâtarde, Robert Pinget, The Libera Me Domine, John Dewey, Art as Experience, Theodor Adorno, Aesthetic Theory, Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction.Course Catalog Number:

In this class, we will consider texts that present ‘re-visions’ of earlier texts through adaptation and intertextuality.  What new critical perspectives emerge when all or part of a narrative is redistributed in a different context?  How do factors such as a change in genre, a change in historical or cultural context, or even a change in the gender of the author create a unique dialogue between earlier texts and later re-visions of them, and what critical purpose does this dialogue serve in each case?  For example, we will consider the relationship between Charles Perrault’s seventeenth-century fairy tales and Angela Carter’s postmodern feminist versions of them.  We will also consider Carter’s intertextual use of the violent pornography of the Marquis de Sade.  What do the genres of fairy tale and pornography have in common?  How do Carter’s re-visions develop interesting arguments about both?All of the main texts on the syllabus were written by female authors, and a majority of the pre-texts were written by male authors.  Questions concerning gender will therefore guide part of our inquiry into literary re-vision.  Women spent ages on the margins of the authorial literary landscape, though they were frequently the subjects of men’s stories.  In some traditions, the female body itself has been associated with rhetorical artifice, both frequently considered in need of regulation and control by men, as the male-authored texts on this syllabus will demonstrate.  How have female authors re-treated women through literary revision?  Specifically how have they re-treated the female body?  In what ways might revising texts written by males be seen as an assertion of women’s intellectual authority? (‘Author’ comes from the Latin auctor, a person who was once considered to possess auctoritas, or ‘authority.’)  What limits on such an assertion are posed by speaking from within the confines of previously written texts?With respect to the medieval and early modern texts on the syllabus, we will also consider how issues pertaining to textual criticism relate to the main questions guiding this class.  How is our modern conception of a ‘text’ altered by considering the fact that numerous medieval manuscripts and early modern printed editions offer different versions of the same story?  How did the simultaneous circulation of multiple versions of the same story inform medieval and early modern reading practices, and how do modern editors grapple with the ‘problem’ of multiple versions?  We will consider how these questions, seemingly unique to medieval and early modern textual matters, actually provide a basis upon which to formulate interesting questions about modern adaptation and intertextuality.We will explore the topics above through active class discussion and intensive writing and essay revision. Main texts, with earlier versions and influences in parentheses, include:Course Catalog Number:

A. GadberrySuppose you and a friend are at your house when a murderer rings your doorbell. You answer the door, and the murderer asks if your friend is inside. (The murderer would like to murder your friend.)Do you lie?Our course will begin by reflecting on the scenario above (and Kant’s famous response to it). As we read novels, poems, plays, short stories, and works of philosophy and literary criticism that deal with lying and liars, we’ll explore the moral and ethical dimensions of the lie. We’ll meet those who lie out of desperation and those who love to lie; from hustlers to hoaxsters, from the fraudulent to the fearful, we’ll try to understand how these characters and the texts in which we find them understand the lie and its social and ethical dimensions. How do various forms of “lying” challenge (or presuppose) established truths? What kind of affective states (anxiety or cunning, for instance) do our texts associate with lying, and how might the emotional landscape around the lie and liars impact the decision to lie (or not)? How does literature understand its own production of fiction in relationship to dissimulation, deceit, or concealment? And finally, how does the lie forge relationships both between “truth” and fiction and between people and the social world? Are there necessary lies?Intensive reading and active class participation is a requirement for this course. Written assignments will include several critical essays and revisions as well as some shorter creative and analytical responses. Students should also anticipate a couple of quizzes and a presentation.Required Readings (N.B.: Please do not purchase the texts until the first day of class.

S.  ChihayaBooks are tricky. They can be seductive, persuasive, misleading– though we may not always realize it, reading can be a dangerous pastime. Over the course of the semester, we will examine several texts that engage with the problems and pitfalls of reading; whether the dangers of reading are implicit or explicit in each, all of them ask us to consider the intimate relationship between book and reader. By turns eerie, puzzling, and comic, these works demand that we consider our own experiences as readers and participants in the imagined worlds of texts.We will explore these texts through discussion, class presentations, and written assignments. Over the course of the semester, students will learn to hone their critical skills and individual prose styles through a series of analytical and creative assignments in order to become more confident and capable readers and writers.Texts will be chosen from the following:Charlotte Lennox, The Female QuixoteIan McEwan, AtonementGustave Flaubert, Madame BovaryItalo Calvino, If on a winter’s night a traveler…Jorge Luis Borges, “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote”Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (selections)Christopher Marlowe, Dr. FaustusVladimir Nabokov, Pale FireHenry James, The Aspern PapersRoland Barthes, Le Plaisir du Texte (selections)Walter Benjamin, “The Storyteller: Reflections on the Works of Nikolai Leskov”Course Catalog Number:

L. Ramos & V. AlcazarWhat is world literature? In this reading and writing intensive course, we will examine works of literature not simply as products of their local environment, but rather, as windows into global cultural relations. In other words, we will uncover how writers imagine a world beyond their immediate circumstances by situating their work in an international context. Beginning with the concept’s origins in Goethe and Marx, we will read works that reveal an understanding of the world as a planetary order in concert and in conflict and as a geopolitical space of antagonisms and alliances. By closely examining texts that dramatize the relation between the local and the global in its manifold manifestations (center versus periphery, metropole versus colony, north versus south and private versus public), our aim will be to unsettle common assumptions about the nation as the primary locus of literary enunciation. However, rather than subscribe to a cosmopolitan view divorced from history or politics, we will strive precisely to reveal both the perils and the promise, both the pitfalls and possibilities inherent in the exchange between cultures across national boundaries.Texts:The Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Kingdom of this World, Alejo CarpentierHeart of Darkness, Joseph ConradSeason of Migration to the North, Tayeb SalihAutobiography of My Mother, Jamaica KincaidFilms:Happy Together, Wong Kar WaiBabel, Alejandro González IñarrituCourse Catalog Number:

H. Freed-Thall & G. PageIn this course, we will investigate diverging accounts of aesthetic experience. Focusing on close reading, analytical writing, and research skills, we will attend to a number of difficult questions. Is there any difference between aesthetic perception and “ordinary” ways of looking at things? What is the relation between the production of art and other forms of labor? Does art have curative or therapeutic properties—can it rescue us from meaninglessness or mend a damaged life? And why does this question of art’s redemptive power become so pressing in modernity?We will read texts that invite very different sorts of attention, ranging from a medieval romance to romantic lyric poetry, from fantastic tales and realist narratives to modernist and postcolonial novels. Many of these works require us to consider the aesthetic potential of objects that fall outside of traditional aesthetic evaluation, whether because they are beneath notice, like a sock or kitchen table, or repugnant, like a maggot-infested stuffed parrot. In other texts, the aesthetic is allied with mute or passive modes of being, like Melville’s mysterious copy clerk, Bartleby—a character so uncharacterizable that we have to reorient ourselves in order to “read” him at all. In futurist and surrealist literature and cinema, on the other hand, art is granted the power to revolutionize the structures of everyday life.A course reader will include selections by Rousseau, Wordsworth, Poe, Baudelaire, Rilke, Melville, Flaubert, Proust, Kafka, Cortázar, Shklovsky, Benjamin, Blanchot, De Certeau, Bourdieu, and Beckett.Texts will be chosen from among the following (please do not purchase books until the first day of class):Chrétien, Yvain Shakespeare, The TempestFlaubert, Madame BovaryWoolf, To the LighthouseSebald, AusterlitzMichon, Small LivesBechdel, Fun Home Visual worksearly silent cinema by the Lumière brothers and MélièsVertov, Kino-EyeBuñuel and Dalí, Un chien andalouVon Donnersmarck, The Lives of Othersimpressionist, post-impressionist, cubist & futurist paintingCourse Catalog Number:

R. FalkoffThis course focuses on three figures that lurk at the fringes of late-capitalism and seem to represent at once the epitome, the inverse and even the undoing of its logics: the fetishist, the collector, and the hoarder. As we examine the material practices and psychic mechanisms that define these identities and authorize distinctions between them, we will consider the relationships between objects and texts and theorize the narrative implications of collecting, fetishism, and hoarding. Our study of the fetishist will begin with Freud’s writings about fetishism and fetishistic disavowal and the vast body of theoretical discourse they inspired.  We will then read Michel Tournier’s short story “The Fetishist,” and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s Venus in Furs. Gilles Deleuze’s analysis of Sacher-Masoch’s novel will help us to develop an understanding of fetishism as a signifying practice characterized by an essential ambivalence.The unit on collecting will begin with writings by Walter Benjamin that figure the collector both as an artist whose work is formed by detaching objects from their original functions and arranging them according to idiosyncratic criteria, and as an archaeologist, whose acquisitions stop up the flow of history, recuperating the fragmentary debris of its blind deluge. Moving from the collector to the hoarder, we will study the distinctions between collecting and accumulation set out in theoretical writings by Susan Stewart and Jean Baudrillard and in the memoir Collections of Nothing by William Davies King.The course will conclude with a consideration of the contemporary discourse of hoarding. We will ask why hoarding has garnered so much attention in the last decade, and why the discourse has come to be characterized by two analytic frameworks that are both contradictory and overlapping: on the one hand, hoarding is figured as both a symptom of and a product of the excesses of consumer culture, while on the other, it is understood as a response to material deprivation. The course aims less to uncover the truth of what causes hoarding (be it privation or plenitude), than to reveal the cultural anxieties the discourse expresses to trace its intersections with two literary precursors, the fetishist and the collector.Coursework will include readings and reading-responses, active participation in class discussions and frequent writing assignments and revisions. Regular attendance and participation is required. You will be encouraged to think critically about your own as well as others’ ideas, and you will learn how to express your interpretations in a coherent and cohesive way. This class will help prepare you for the rest of your academic career, regardless of your field of interest or the length of your studies.Course Catalog Number:

T. Singleton & B. RubergThe ultimate villain in our stories is the monster; we project our conceptions of evil onto what we decide to call monsters. However, a monster is most often characterized in terms of physical description. Is a monster then, what we see and fear, what we know and hate, or what we don’t know and can’t bear? How then does evil function in our lives and society? This class will discuss classic and new literature and film to explore the social implications of the labels “monster” and “evil” to cover difference and unfamiliarity. We will explore literature that challenges traditional conceptions of archetypal monsters and the evil that drives them.

S. Cochran & A. BrockEvery literary tradition of every period has its monsters—from the mythical Medusa to fairy tale witches, from Kafka’s Gregor Samsa to Hannibal Lektor, from the monstrous mother of Aeschylus’ Oresteia to the lesbian vampires of Sheridan Le Fanu.  These are figures whose excesses often place them in a category beyond the human.  And yet their grip on our imagination suggests we also find in them—in their violence and uncouth energies and grotesque bodies—a certain kinship.This will be a course in which we discuss great works of literature, film, and art, and explore the notion of the monstrous in its relation to the civilized, to sexuality and gender, to everyday life, and to the unconscious mind.  In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument.

L. Gurton-WachterIs the experience of spectatorship active or passive, pleasurable or disturbing, a responsibility or a retreat from it? We tend to think of the acts of watching, looking, and observing as straightforward and stable experiences with relatively few problems. We rarely attend to our own roles as spectators when we watch films or television, and we typically trust our powers of observation to watch and evaluate the world around us without interference. In this course, we will investigate the positions from which we watch through a series of texts, films, performances, and images that question and destabilize our roles and responsibilities as spectators. Using Aristotle’s model of how audiences respond to and experience tragedy as our starting point, we will then read a series of texts that suggest that the act of looking – though it might seem both natural and neutral – is actually fraught with political and ethical consequences. We will think about the experience of watching and witnessing the suffering of others, about how we look at or observe those who are different from ourselves, and consider how photography, film, and theater transform what it means to watch altogether. Central to our discussions will be the pleasures and perils of watching, and the question of how distance and proximity alter the object of our observation. We will devote a significant portion of the class to thinking specifically about theater and the role of the audience, imagining theater as a site in which ethical debates about looking emerge, and asking whether theater and performance provokes, pacifies, shocks, or instructs its viewers.This reading and composition course will introduce students to methods of close reading, critical thinking, argumentative writing, and research. There will be weekly grammar and style assignments, and significant time spent on revision and improving students’ writing.Readings will include*:Aristotle, The Poetics

D. Simon & R. McGlazerIt’s commonplace to praise a novel by saying it “comes alive,” but much less commonplace to recognize such a statement as a miniature act of puppetry, which grants life to a handheld object as artificial as it is inanimate. All literary genres display elements of puppetry: reading a lyric poem, for instance, often means conjuring forth a counterfeit human face that speaks or sings. This course will explore works of literary art that reflect on the nature of reading and writing by drawing on the art of puppetry, conceived broadly to include a wide range of practices that extend (or replace) human (or animal) body parts. As we proceed, we’ll consider the complications that arise when humans take on the artificiality of puppets; and puppets, the vivacity of human beings. Although we’ll be interested in broad themes (the human and the inhuman, the organic and the inorganic), as well as distinct but related issues (robotics, prosthetics, remote control, and “puppet governments”), our goal will be to focus on the specifics of the puppeteer’s art: the throwing of voices (and faces, by delegating the responsibility for facial expression to the hand), the splitting of subjectivity (as in the ventriloquist’s repartee with his dummy), and the combination of jerkiness and fluidity in aesthetic imitations of life (as in the marionette theater). As the course title indicates, we’ll pay special attention to the puppet’s frequent status as an object of fear (tinged with desire). Texts/films will include some of the following, in addition to critical readings from De Man, Freud, Johnson, Nelson, Stewart-Steinberg, and Winnicott:Plato, The Republic (selections on the allegory of the cave [of shadow puppets])
Homer, The Odyssey (selections on Odysseus’s manipulation of sheep)

M. LeeThis course begins by asking the question: is history what it used to be? We humans cannot help but remember or want to remember the past, and often device all manner of technologies and apparatuses to ensure the proper archivization of our limited time on earth. Historiography is one such apparatus. Its premise is that by following a concrete methodology about verifiable data it creates reliable knowledge about the past. In this course we will ask what is left out of this neat genre and system of remembrance. Or conversely, might there be things better left forgotten? What other modes of experiencing and constructing the past are available to us, and what do they bring to the table that history cannot or does not?Students will attempt to go beyond the “what” and “how” of the past, and reflect on the roles that the medium, mode, and archivist have on what we remember. In other words, we will think about how knowledge of the past, i.e. an archive, is created. To this end, students will study a variety of texts engaged with creating as well as remembering the past: as verifiable data, and as a means of doing justice to the breadth of human experience otherwise not captured by history. Throughout the course we will explore the relationship that memory and history have to the present and to the future, and how this relationship might be of significance.The course will build on the writing and reading skills introduced in R1A (or equivalent), and will work toward producing a final, researched paper after a series of shorter writing assignments and revisions. In addition, students will engage in active and thoughtful class discussion as a means of honing their analytical skills.REQUIRED TEXTS:Sophocles, Antigone  (ISBN 052101073X)Christopher Columbus, The Diario of Christopher Columbus´s First Voyage to America (Selections in Reader)Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, The Narrative of Cabeza de Vaca (ISBN 080326416X)Juan José Saer, The Witness (ISBN 1846686911)Aimé Césaire, Discourse on Colonialism (ISBN 1583670254)J.M.

Writing has proven itself a particularly contentious political activity in the history of Latin American literature. From the early debate about whether or not “paper talks” in Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca’s Comentarios Reales to the misquoted graffiti at the beginning of Sarmiento’s Facundo to Fidel Castro’s guidelines for writers in “Palabras a los intelectuales,” what one has written on or about (escrito sobre) has often been interpreted as criminal. In this course we will examine scenes where the act of writing appears to transgress the law, as well as novels and stories in the noir genre (“el policial negro”) that take crime as their subject matter. Towards the end of the semester we will turn to the case of copyright and the internet’s role in recent debates about writing and human rights in contemporary Cuba. As we move through the syllabus we might want to ask: What constitutes a “criminal” act of writing? What does crime allow writers to say about writing and the law? When and how does plagiarism become literature? What is the relationship between writing and property? How does writing’s legal and aesthetic status change as it moves away from paper and out into the street or onto the web?Prerequisite: AP Spanish in high school or score of 3 or better on AP Exam, Spanish 4 or 25, or native speaker with adequate skills for the class.  A brief oral examination of Spanish will be given the first day of class.* All readings, aside from critical essays, will be in Spanish.

M. Lucey Berkeley Arts Seminar Course*This seminar’s purpose will be to help us become informed listeners at the Kurt Elling concert sponsored by Cal Performances on Saturday, April 23, 2011. Elling’s latest album, “Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman,” won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album.  The seminar requires no musical training, and no previous acquaintance with jazz, although we’ll happily make use of any jazz expertise seminar participants may have.  We’ll study how jazz works as music, and how jazz works as a culture. The Elling concert will happen toward the end of the semester.  Throughout the semester we will watch and listen to some classic recorded jazz performances, as well as to live music (depending on the schedules that are announce for spring) by jazz musicians in events sponsored by the Music Department, or at the Jazzschool in downtown Berkeley, or at the world-famous jazz club in Oakland, Yoshi’s.  Please note that admission to events on campus will be provided at no cost to students.Our particular focus throughout the semester will be on how and why jazz musicians spend so much time listening to other jazz musicians and learning from them, and how they acknowledge what they’ve learned and who they’ve learned from during their own performances.  Of course our major case study will be Elling’s “Dedicated to You,” and the two albums on which it is based, “John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman” and  “John Coltrane Quartet-Ballads.”  But Elling has a long practice of recording tributes to jazz musicians who have inspired him, so we’ll also listen to and learn from earlier tribute tracks Elling has done, not only to Coltrane, but also to artists such as Dexter Gordon and Keith Jarrett. Along with our musical texts, we will also read a recent book by Ben Ratliff, “Coltrane: The Story of a Sound,” in order to understand the unique place Coltrane occupies in jazz history.  We’ll also be reading sections from Paul F. Berliner’s “Thinking in Jazz: The Infinite Art of Improvisation” to help us learn about how jazz music and jazz culture work.*Berkeley Arts Seminars are small, faculty-led seminars that give UC Berkeley

L. RamosIn this course we will make use of recent efforts to remap the Caribbean beyond linguistic and insular categories by exploring critical concepts and concerns Hispanic, Anglophone and Francophone authors share in common. Drawing from a wide range of disciplines (literature, history, and anthropology) and genres (fiction, drama and travel writing), we will examine how explorers, writers and scholars have continuously sought to redefine the Caribbean at critical moments in its recorded history. Beginning with the literature of discovery and exploration, we will examine how efforts to represent the region were historically linked to the desire for territorial control and imperial expansion. We will then turn to literary responses to the cultures of violence and subjection that the advent of European colonial rule brought about. Along similar lines, we will consider efforts by both critics and novelists to recover or rethink the histories of anti-slavery resistance in the Caribbean from the Haitian Revolution to the present. Finally, we will read works that seek to re-imagine the region’s parameters through their exploration of alternate location-based identities.

J. JimenezAt the heart of this course is coming to terms with the question: what is an American? This is a fraught question; the answer seems everywhere self-evident, for many, yet what is or makes an American is radically contingent. In this course, we will approach the question of who, what, and/or how one is an American by focusing on three discrete historical time periods (settlement and colonization, the consolidation of the U.S. as an independent nation-state, and the late twentieth century) and by attempting to track the encounters of different sorts of people—different sorts of “Americans”—inscribed in narratives, plays, and novels. In the first phase of the class, we will read about and study the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans, how settlement and colonization were mutually catastrophic for colonizers and natives alike, and how representations of captivity contribute to our understanding of colonial (European) subjects and Native American “insurgents.” We will then explore the founding of the American Republic and register the transition from colony to nation, again focusing on the encounter between the newly constituted American citizens and their slaves. Finally, we will investigate the self-consciously multicultural United States of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century by focusing on the encounter between immigrants and sexual minorities—New Americans—with/in the United States and its peoples. Throughout the course, we will complement our understanding of “American” as U.S. citizens with texts from our American cousins from the “South” to help us complicate what it has meant to be an American from within and without the nation. Not only will we challenge and potentially generate new meanings for “American,” we will also engage in a discussion of the reified concepts of race, gender, and ethnicity as they intersect with competing notions of “American.”Course Catalog Number:

A. NesbetIn this class we will take a close and multi-faceted look at books written primarily for children, a category of literature that remains rather under-examined, despite its popularity, persistence, and influence.  We will read examples of stories for children written in a number of different times (from the 18th to the 21st centuries) and places (Europe, Britain, North America), and our readings will make use of many different kinds of literary analysis:  historical contextualization, analyses that draw on particular literary theories, psychoanalytical approaches, and close readings.  We will also pay some attention to the development of the children’s literature industry in the United States.  Readings will include, on the one hand, stories by writers like the Brothers Grimm,Carlo Collodi, Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, Tove Jansson, Madeleine L’Engle, and E. B. White, and, on the other hand, Propp, Freud,Bettelheim, Derrida, Foucault, Genette, and Garber.There are a number of out-of-print books required (in unabridged form) for the class that students may have at home or be able to find used:  Johanna Spyri, Heidi [1880]; Laura Ingalls Wilder, Little House on the Prairie [1935];  Lois Lenski, Judy’s Journey [1947]; Jane Langton, The Diamond in the Window[1972].   (There will also be a Reader with secondary materials and excerpts.)

M. LuceyThe literary critic, Mikhail Bakhtin, once commented that “the novel as a whole is an utterance just as rejoinders in everyday dialogue or private letters are.”  Of course we often talk in loose ways about literary texts (among others) as being part of a large “conversation.”  In this course we’ll try to treat Bakhtin’s proposition seriously and rigorously.  What would be the larger language on which an author would draw to make a specific novelistic utterance?  How could one such novelistic utterance be taken to be a rejoinder to another.  What training is required in order to be able to listen in on a conversation like this?  We will read a series of six novels that might possibly be taken to be participating in a couple of related conversations.  We will also read theoretical and critical texts to help us develop our thinking about novelistic utterances and the ways they take on meaning. Novels:  Walter Scott, The Antiquary;  Balzac,  Cousin Pons; Henry James, The Spoils of Poynton; William Faulkner, As I Lay Dying, Maryse Condé,  Crossing the Mangrove, Robert Pinget, That Voice.Course Catalog Number:

B. AlterThis course will explore the biblical tradition in Western literature by a series of close readings of selected biblical texts in conjunction with a series of novels written in different languages from the eighteenth century to the twentieth that make central use of these biblical sources. One underlying concern of the course will be the nature of intertextuality, that is, how writers confront and transform their literary antecedents, and how a literary tradition articulates itself through a process of restless allusion. No previous familiarity with the Bible is presumed, and thus one of the goals of the course will be learning to read precisely and to appreciate the distinctive literary structures and conventions of the Bible.Required textsH.

In this course we will read a number of seminal texts from one of the most innovative, multi-dimensional, aesthetically complex, and lasting literary traditions in the European Middle Ages: the literature on love (or, as often, but misleadingly labeled, on “courtly love”). Exploring this rich tradition via different genres, we will read vernacular and Latin love lyrics (e.g. Troubadour poetry, German Minnesang and Carmina Buarana), vernacular romances (e.g. Erec and Tristan), and theoretical treatises on love.  In reading and comparing these texts we will engage in literary analysis (form, imagery, recurrent elements, principal ideas, beginnings/ends, construction of a speaker/’I’, performance), explore the intersections of love literature and other discourses (medical, theological, legal), and discuss the relationship between our texts and the complex intellectual and social milieus in which they originated.As no familiarity with the Middle Ages is required, we will discuss (sometimes after lectures, but mostly in a seminar format) some basic aspects of medieval literary culture, among them: authorship, literary institutions, manuscripts, the performance of literature. In consequence, the course can also be attended as an introduction into medieval literature and literary culture.Language requirements: We will read texts in Latin, French, and German (with an emphasis on Latin and German). As medieval Latin, and particularly French/Occitan and German markedly differ from their modern form, all texts will be made available in English (mostly by bilingual editions). Students with knowledge of Latin, French, and German will profit from encountering an unknown variety of ‘their’ language, so in addition to English training in one other language (Latin or French or German) is recommended. Students should be prepared to engage with both a broad variety of texts and intensive close-reading.Some of the texts we read:–          selected Troubadour poems by Jaufre Rudel, Bernart de Ventadorn, Marcabru–          selected poems from Minnesang (Walther of the Vogelweide, Heinrich of Morungen)–          selected poems from the Carmina Burana (tr. Walsh)*–          Andreas Capellanus, On Love (extracts)–          Chretien of Troyes, The Knight of the Cart (tr. Staines)*–          Hartmann of Aue, Erec (tr. Tobin)*–          Gottfried of Strasbourg, Tristan (tr. Hatto)*–          possibly: Dante, Vita Nuova (tr. Cervini/Vasta)*All love poems will be made available in bilingual editions via bspace.

Professor R. KaufmanCourse Description: Seminar-lecture mix. Emphasis on close reading–lots of reading, and lots of careful re-reading!–with particular attention to the formal poetic-aesthetic dynamics (including metrics, tone, genre, structure, and related matters of form and style) and ethical/sociopolitical engagements of the poetry of the major “Beats” and of those poets from the United States whose work and dates overlap with the Beat movement, including Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Peter Orlovsky, Diane Di Prima, Gregory Corso, Michael McClure, Gary Synder, Bob Kaufman, Anne Waldman, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Philip Whalen, Joanne Kyger, John Wieners, Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser, Denise Levertov, Robert Creeley, John Ashbery, Frank O’Hara, Barbara Guest, James Schuyler,  et al); some brief re-considerations of Modernist predecessors, including William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), Bertolt Brecht, Federico García Lorca,
Louis Zukofsky. While the course will spend vastly more time on poems than on documentary and contextual materials, we will pay significant attention to political and cultural pressures and movements–inside and outside the U.S.–that the poetry encountered, was at least partially shaped by, and in some cases helped re-shape. With reference to our course title: “At Home” will mean the poems written, and usually first published, in the U.S. (almost always in English);”Abroad” will mean consideration of three things: (1) the European, Canadian, Caribbean, Latin American, Asian, and/or African influences on the U.S. Beats and allied experimental poets, and in some cases, the poets’ experiences traveling, living, and working outside the U.S.; (2) translations–literally, of Beat poems; metaphorically, of Beat or alternative culture–into the poetry, criticism, and culture of French, Spanish, and German-speaking countries; and (3) poems written by European, Canadian, Caribbean, Latin American, Asian, and African poets who found themselves influenced by–or who found themselves in dialogue with­-Beat and related experimental U.S. poetry. In addition to poetry and poetry-focused literary and sociopolitical criticism, we will look at some works of cinema and philosophy.(Note on non-English texts: Students will not be required to have proficiency in languages other than English, although ability to read in Spanish, French, and/or German will benefit students significantly, since we will often shuttle between those languages and English as we compare original and translated versions of various poems.)Course Catalog Number:

F. MasielloThis is a senior seminar devoted to the study of two modernist authors: the Irish writer James Joyce and the Argentinian Roberto Arlt. A paradox immediately confronts us when we draw such dissimilar and differently valued authors together: how can we competently situate Arlt, a marginal writer from the Latin American periphery, one who professes “to write badly” (while Borges, his local rival, makes claim to the precision of form), one who brings to literature the themes of delinquency and authoritarian rule, urban squalor, misogyny, and perversion, against the towering figure of Joyce, arguably the central figure of the modernist canon?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number:

A. Francois“Sacrifice Literature” explores key concepts in critical theory (allegory, interpretation, latency, transference, sacrifice, image-making, textual pleasure, aesthetic value, the esoteric and exoteric, discipleship and discipline) and is designed as an introduction to representative critical debates in the field of comparative literature—debates concerning post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, post-colonial and subaltern studies, feminism, psychoanalysis, and the critique of secularism. Taking the course title as an imperative (as well as a noun-phrase), we will focus on scenes of sacrifice, iconoclasm, sublimation, renunciation, repudiation, exchange, enclosure and conversion, while giving special attention to literary theory’s ambivalence toward representation and its compliance with the taboo on images. We will also explore imperatives to “sacrifice literature” in the critique of literature as an institution, of the realm of aesthetic judgment, and of close reading as the prevailing technique of the discipline.Selections from Adorno, Agamben, Auerbach, Barthes, Bataille, Benjamin, Derrida, de Man, Fanon, Freud, Galeano, Guillory, Hegel, Henry James, Jameson, Barbara Johnson, Kafka, Kierkegaard, Lacan, Marx, Nietzsche, Ovid, Rousseau, Said, Silverman, Spivak, Strauss.Course Catalog Number:

V. KahnWhat do we mean by “early modern?” How has the concept of the early modern been constructed? How have twentieth-century theorists and philosophers read early modern texts and with what consequences for contemporary theory? In this course, we will focus on a group of twentieth-century European critics who turned to early modern texts to make sense of the crisis of modernity during the interwar period. Rather than exploring how the early modern period anticipated modern ideas of liberalism, rights, and scientific progress (one standard reading of the period), these critics focused instead on the ways in which the early modern period contributed to a crisis of historicism and secular reason that in turn fueled new forms of political theology, including fascism and totalitarianism, in the twentieth century. Of particular concern to the modern theorists was a constellation of issues that are directly relevant to critical debates today: the meaning of political theology, the relationship between secularism and historicism, and the role of literary culture in the newly secular European nation-states. The moderns we will consider include Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, Alexandre Kojève, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Kantorowicz, Hannah Arendt, Louis Althusser and Etienne Balibar. The early moderns include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Shakespeare, and SpinozaCourse Catalog Number:

C. KronfeldIn this seminar we will explore developments in the field of translation studies that have taken it beyond the once common metaphors of fidelity and betrayal, of being faithful or unfaithful to the “original.”  We’ll focus on (mis)translations as symptomatic of the poetic and political dynamics of the negotiations between cultures in a particular historical moment. We’ll discuss a variety of approaches to the theory of translation, from system theory to postcolonial and globalization studies, both by reading critically and by theorizing from the translation practice itself. Central issues will include the role of translation in the construction of national and transnational literary histories, (un)equal power relations in the cultural negotiations between source and target text, recovering the role of agency in translation, and translation as intertextual practice.Participants will experiment with collaborative translations of poetry from “their” language(s) and provide a comparative critical analysis of the poetics and politics implicit in influential translation projects in these languages.  The poetry of Yehuda Amichai (1924-2000), translated from the Hebrew, will serve as our anchor, providing both a case study and an alternative theoretical model.  We will read closely Amichai’s last book, Open Closed Open, where he foregrounds translation-work as valorized woman’s-work and offers a meditation on translation as a metonymy for poetry – for the translator/poet’s intertextual wrestling with the authority of the past or her/his struggles against the political and academic “Newspeak” of the present.Guest discussions by local translators and translation scholars.Students will work in small groups and present their translation and critical process to the seminar.  Collaborative oral and written projects will be encouraged.  Seminar paper: an annotated translation project with theoretical and historical introduction.READING LIST: 1)      Lawrence Venutti, The Translation Studies Reader, London& N.Y.:Routledge, 2000.2)      Tejaswini Niranjana, Siting Translation: History, Post-Structuralism, and the Colonial Context, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992.3)      Yehuda Amichai, Open Closed Open, trans.

R. Lorenz & J. NelsenIn this course, we will read stories of people seduced away from a well-balanced life by the allures of beauty, art, revenge, sex, sentiment—or even by rational thought pushed to extremes. Although we could label these characters as mentally ill, many of the texts we will read portray their deviance as an ambiguous sort of exaltation. Accordingly, we will analyze how each text presents the terrible costs of losing grip, as well as how the characters, from the point of view of their extreme principles, offer a twisted justification for the unbalanced life.These texts will offer stimulating material for the primary aim of the course, which is to teach you how to write convincing essays filled with intelligent analysis and argument. A considerable amount of class time will thus be devoted explicitly to writing instruction, so that you can exit the course with some well-honed and very useful practical skills. As in all R & C courses, 32 pages of writing are required, including first drafts and rewrites.Texts:Euripides, MedeaE.T.A.

In this class we will explore the singular relationship between the family and story telling. What is the relationship between family, identity, memory, and narrative? To what extent do the stories that are passed down through our families shape who we are and determine what kind of a world we inherit? What is the importance of unearthing, reconstructing, telling, and re-telling the stories of how our families came to be?These are some of the questions we will address while examining texts from a wide range of time periods and cultural traditions. In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument. To this end, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling argumentative paper.Required Texts (Available for purchase at the bookstore unless otherwise indicated):Sophocles Oedipus the KingShakespeare, William King LearLispector, Clarice Family Ties (selections)*Russ, Joana “Autobiography of my Mother”*Faulkner, William The Sound and the FuryJones, Gayl CorregidoraSatrapi, Marjane Chicken with PlumsAlexie, Sherman War Dances (selections)*Will be available on bspace in the Resources folder (you do not need to purchase these texts)Course Catalog Number:

P. ChatterjiThis is not a class about Facebook. However, we will think about how contemporary experiences of social networking can help us to describe relationships between individuals, social systems, and the connections between them. We will trace back some of these issues by reading books and watching films that predate contemporary social networks. Particular attention will be paid to the role of technology. In the works that we encounter, technologies of communication – the letter, the apartment building, the telephone, the computer – play a large role in our understanding of the content of the message, the purpose of communicating, the boundary between public and private, our notion of belonging in a community, and even our sense of self.This is a writing intensive course. We will spend considerable time in class on improving students’ writing skills by working on clarity, argument development and research basics. Students will participate in writing workshops and be asked to complete two papers, one of which will be a research project.

B. Ruberg & L. Forrest-WhiteAt a time when technology threatens to render the printed word obsolete, storytelling still permeates our lives as consumers of media. Far from relinquishing literature to the library, this class explores what we can learn when we bring our “old” literary reading skills to newer texts: video games, social media, interactive fiction. Highlighting the “comparative” in Comparative Literature, we pair canonical works — from Ovid to Shakespeare to Alice in Wonderland — with examples of new media. Along with an emphasis on essay writing skills, this creative reading list encourages students to consider with a new analytical eye issues of art, narrative, politics, and more in forms both traditional and high-tech.Reading/Viewing List

M. Bhaumik Democracy—a term used almost daily by the press, governments, law, social movements, and many poets—is not a new word but has a long history and multiple meanings. In particular, poets writing in different languages and epochs have been moved by the possibilities of the word and concept from ancient Athens to contemporary social movements. One of the central theses of the class is that poetry offers a critical reading about the politics of truth at play in everyday life. During a time of national crisis in 1870, for example, Walt Whitman writes about the “spirit” of democracy in a long poem entitled “Democratic Vistas.” The work appears as congressional debates on the rights of enslaved populations to vote and count as citizens emerge in the public sphere. In many respects, poetry puts forth the question about who has a voice and who counts as a citizen within nation-states. In this class, we will interpret mostly poetry but also some dramatic texts, novels, critical essays, songs, multi-media and protests using lyrics in order to ask: what is the relation between verse and democracy? How is the depiction of democracy in poetic verse distinct from the legal or governmental definitions? In order to analyze these questions in depth, we will not just focus on poetry written in English and in the United States but look at the lyric across cultures. Drawing from critical approaches to literary studies in a comparative versus a purely nationalist frame, we will then also consider what it means to read poems in translation. Does translation—a mode of moving a literary text from its original location to another—offer a distinct notion of understanding between differently positioned speakers that is crucial for democracy to flourish? Our class will concentrate on the specific form of the lyric and also musical forms closely linked poetic verse (the ballad, corrido, ghazal, and Rabindra Sangeet) in order to engage with the important question of how democracy is contradictory, difficult, ironic, mythological, satirical, and tragic, but also imagined and possible. The primary reading for the class will be a course reader including the writings of Mahmoud Darwish, Charlotte Delbo, Robert Haas, Emily Dickinson, Jose Marti, Gabriela Mistral, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Pablo Neruda, Percy Shelley, Rabindranath Tagore, W.B. Yeats, and Walt Whitman. We will also read some short excerpts and critical essays by Aristotle, Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin, C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Sophocles.Longer TextsCourse Catalog Number:

D. InciarteThe Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read critical essays that will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.

M. Cohen & R. CarbottiWhat if the Cold War became hot? What if John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry had succeeded?  What if the bomb under Hitler’s desk hadn’t missed? “What if” is the question that jump starts the imagination of children and scientists, writers and science fiction nerds, oppressed peoples and activists—everyone who thinks about making a different world possible. Science Fiction in general has sometimes been called “the literature of change”: take the world you know, imagine a possibly possible change, and chart the way from here to there. This course will zoom in on the hybrid child of science fiction and history: Alternate History. Alternate histories are science fiction that can take place in the past, the present or future, if only something in the “real world” had gone a little differently. We’ll look at examples from the hey-day of SF in 20th century US literature, but we’ll also explore older historical works and works from other literatures which ask the same question, “what if?”  Rather than escaping through a wormhole in search of sexy green aliens, we’ll investigate works in which “the literature of change” is concerned with this world: why are things the way they are? What’s gone wrong? And what are the political alternatives that might not be so fantastic, if we could only see the way from here to there?The major goal of this course is to develop and practice critical reading and writing skills for a broad range of analytical and research writing, with the alternate histories serving as rich, stimulating and hopefully fun material for our writing. Through workshops, revisions, and collaborative work we’ll improve our ability to read a text analytically, create interesting and meaningful arguments, and support those arguments through research. In addition to the works of fiction, we’ll read literary and historical essays both as writing models and to engage our readings with their ideas.Readings (and films) for the course may include: Alan Moore’s Watchmen, Terry Bisson’s Fire on the Mountain, Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle, stories by Jorge Luis Borges, the Coen Brothers’ “Inglorious Basterds” and Michael Chabon’s The Yiddish Policemen’s Union.Course Catalog Number:

R. McGlazer and K. KadueAccording to at least one influential definition of aesthetic experience, art begins when appetite ends. By this account, artistic and gustatory, or figurative and literal, taste cannot coincide; hunger and even “healthy appetite” must be satisfied before any aesthetic pursuit can take place. In this course, we’ll study works of literature and art that refuse this definition by taking denial, rather than satisfaction, as their point of departure.  Far from setting hunger aside, the texts we’ll consider try to set it to work.  Sampling from the fasting practices of medieval women mystics and contemporary couture models’ starvation diets, we’ll cultivate our critical reading, writing, and basic research skills as we consider the relationship between writing and withholding as staged in a range of contexts and cultures.  (For our purposes, “writing” will be broadly defined, to include art-making and self-invention.)  In addition to looking at mystics and models, we’ll listen to Italian Renaissance lyricists “starved” for love and to severely undernourished English Romantics.  We’ll then travel forward to the 1970s to spend time with anorectic All-American teen idols and dessert-obsessed Brazilian typists.  We’ll take virtual day trips to nearby Pelican Bay and distant Belfast, with a week’s stay in Wonderland.  Along the way, we’ll ask how hunger comes to serve as both a figure for desire (so that lyric speakers are said to hunger for affection, and scholars to hunger for knowledge) and a name for need (so that famine marks the most abject poverty).  We’ll also ask questions like the following: What do artists and writers have to teach us about “unhealthy” appetites?  What role does temperance, the moderation or curbing of appetite, play in aesthetic experience?  What happens when works of literature and art call attention to their own slightness, or lack of substance?  When, where, and in what ways has hunger become a tool of protest as well as an aesthetic category? How can we bring the work of “hunger artists” and hunger strikers to bear in our understanding of contemporary food politics, or in politics more generally?Rather than answering these questions in abstract—and unsatisfying—ways, students will learn to read closely and to make clear and compelling arguments about literary texts.  Readings, screenings, and writing activities for the course will all encourage students to attend carefully to a wide range of aesthetic experiences, in order to develop tastes but also to work up healthy appetites for research.In addition to reading some of the texts and watching some of the films listed below, we’ll read historical and critical works by Brown, Bynum, Deleuze and Guattari, Ellman, Klein, and Vernon, and we’ll study performance art pieces by Abramović and Mendieta, among others.Literature:Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in WonderlandCatherine of Siena, selected lettersDickinson, selected poemsGoethe, Elective AffinitiesKafka, “A Hunger Artist” and “The Hunger Strike”Lispector, The Hour of the StarMahasweta, selected storiesMilton, Paradise Regain’dPetrarch, selected poemsRabelais, Gargantua and PantagruelShelley, Alastor; or, The Spirit of SolitudeVallejo, selected poemsFilm:Buñuel, The Land without Bread (1933)Haynes, Superstar (1987)McQueen, Hunger (2008)Pasolini, La ricotta (1962)Course Catalog Number:

Paul HaackeIn this class we will study works of fiction that revolve around rogues, tricksters, and outlaws, whether comic or tragic, sympathetic or monstrous. We will start with folktales, cartoons and picaresque stories, move on to novels, plays, films, and other narrative critiques of social mores, and also examine relevant theory and criticism that raise larger questions about rogue discourses. Particular attention will be paid to the period of economic boom and bust in the first half of the twentieth century and its implications for more current concerns. Topics for discussion will include narrative discourse, irony and point-of-view; social inequality and mobility; power, ideology, and tactics of resistance; cynicism and false consciousness; criminality and the law; and the ethics and politics of recognition and redistribution.Through regular written assignments and in-class discussion, we will also work on developing skills for writing and revising argumentative, analytical essays. Requirements will include prompt attendance and participation, short writing responses on bSpace, a midterm essay analyzing course materials closely, and a longer research paper or independent project.BooksLewis Hyde, Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth and Art (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux)

L. WagnerIn this course we’ll consider texts that dramatize the act of storytelling.  Each of the texts we’ll examine, whether an ancient epic or postcolonial novel, Renaissance drama or Romantic poem, fairy tale or work of literary theory, is interested in the act of communication between storyteller and listener, or writer and reader, that characterizes the sharing of a story.  We’ll think about what forms these stories take when they come to us on the page or the stage and consider what’s at stake in the choice to tell a story in a particular way.  We’ll look at the relationship between stories and physical spaces, narrative and the self, and speech and the written word; we’ll question the ethics and politics of telling or receiving a story; we’ll interrogate the interplay between stories, memories, and history; and we’ll consider what happens to stories when communication breaks down.  Most importantly, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading, basic research, and analytical writing skills, learning to become careful readers of stories of all types and to better shape the critical stories that we tell in writing our own interpretations of literary texts. Course readings will be chosen from the following: Texaco, Patrick ChamoiseauInvisible Cities, Italo CalvinoThe Storyteller, Mario Vargas Llosa“Max Ferber,” W.G. SebaldThe Tempest, William ShakespeareA course reader will include “The Storyteller” by Walter Benjamin, “Eckbert the Fair” by Ludwig Tieck, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, excerpts from The Thousand and One Nights and Homer’s Odyssey, and varied resources on writing and research.Course Catalog Number:

P. ChatterjiThis is not a class about Facebook. However, we will think about how contemporary experiences of social networking can help us to describe relationships between individuals, social systems, and the connections between them. We will trace back some of these issues by reading books and watching films that predate contemporary social networks. Particular attention will be paid to the role of technology. In the works that we encounter, technologies of communication – the letter, the apartment building, the telephone, the computer – play a large role in our understanding of the content of the message, the purpose of communicating, the boundary between public and private, our notion of belonging in a community, and even our sense of self.This is a writing intensive course. We will spend considerable time in class on improving students’ writing skills by working on clarity, argument development and research basics. Students will participate in writing workshops and be asked to complete two papers, one of which will be a research project. Works to be discussed include:Plato, The RepublicAusten, Pride and PrejudiceBalzac, Père GoriotMarshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg GalaxyHitchcock, Rear WindowShteyngart, Super Sad True Love StoryCourse Catalog Number:

It is about putting life back in where only a vague memory or a bare trace was visible to those who bothered to look.[1] Taking cues from Avery Gordon, this course will consider seriously the matter of ghosts in literary texts. Ghosts are not simply the incorporeal return of the dead associated with religious or spiritual practices and beliefs. Rather, they are public, social figures whose haunting can take us to “that dense site where history and subjectivity make social life.”[2] Their practice of haunting underscores contemporary concerns about narratives of exclusion and silencing, as well as the concern with what can actually be known and the ethical considerations that such investigations should demand. The course will ask the following: 1) What is the political status of ghosts in memory, commemoration, and the nostalgia of exile? 2) What can our study of ghosts reveal about the historical and linguistic structures that are the sources of their haunting? 3) What conceptual and ethical dilemmas must we confront in such an investigation? 4) How do we capture the ghostly-speak?

J. CaballeroThis course is a writing course first and a crash course in comparative and historical literary study second.  We will be focusing on process writing (as set out in Writing Analytically, our course’s textbook) and dividing the course in halves for both reading and writing purposes.In the first half of the course, we will work primarily through poetry to workshop the basic skills of literary study and of process writing, working over many weeks on a straightforward paper analyzing one work of poetry.  The literary reading load will be relatively low these weeks to accommodate more out-of-class, collaborative reading and writing exercises, and of course to allow time for reading the course’s hefty writing manual.In the second half of the course, mostly devoted to novels and short stories, we will work through the skills not only of prose stylistics and narrative study, but also of research methods for relating works across time periods, to their historical contexts and subtexts, or to changing cultural and individual ideologies.Poetry Unit will include (ALL included in a separate Poetry Reader):–          *Alonso de Ercilla (Spain) – La Araucana (epic – excerpts!)  1578–          *Esteban Echevarría (Arg) – La Cautiva (epic) 1837–          *Henry Longfellow (USA) – Song of Hiawatha (epic – excerpts!) 1855–          *Leopoldo Lugones (Arg) – Romances del Río Seco (lyric) 1938 (posthum)–          *Gloría Anzaldúa (USA) – Borderlands (lyric) 1987–          *Rosario Castellanos (Mex) – Selected Poems / Poesía no eres tu (lyric) 1969–          *Elizabeth Bishop (USA) – Questions of Travel; Geography III (lyric) 1965; 1976Possible works of the Narrative Unit may include (* = included in Excerpt Reader):–          James Fenimore Cooper (USA) – The Pioneers (novel) 1823 [0140390073]

R. FalkoffThis course is dedicated to three figures that lurk at the fringes of capitalism and seem to represent at once the epitome, the inverse, and even the undoing of its logics. Our aim will be to shed light on the contemporary obsession with hoarding by studying the hoarder in relation to two precursors of 19th and 20th century narrative and theory: the fetishist and the collector. We will examine the material practices and psychic mechanisms that define these identities and authorize distinctions between them, as well as the diverse historical contexts from which they emerge. More broadly, we will theorize the relationships between objects and narrative.Our study of the fetishist begins with writings by Freud and Marx, along with selections from the vast body of theoretical work they inspired. Christian Metz’ “Photography and the Fetish” will propel our examination of still and moving images in short films dedicated to possessions: Miska Draskoczy’s “Here’s the Thing” webisodes and Martin Hampton’s Possessed. The unit on collecting will include the novel Cousin Pons by Honoré de Balzac, as well as William Davies King’s memoir Collections of Nothing. Moving from the collector to the hoarder, we will first consider the distinctions between collecting and accumulating set out by Susan Stewart in On Longing and Jean Baudrillard in System of Objects, then turn to contemporary texts dedicated to hoarding: E. L. Doctorow’s 2009 novel Homer and Langley, Jessie Sholl’s 2010 memoir Dirty Secret: A Daughter Comes Clean About Her Mother’s Compulsive Hoarding, and Randy Frost and Gail Steketee’s 2010 Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things, as well as episodes of Bones and CSI.Coursework will include readings and reading-responses, active participation in class discussions and frequent writing assignments and revisions. Regular attendance and participation is required. You will be encouraged to think critically about your own as well as others’ ideas, and you will learn how to express your interpretations in a coherent and cohesive way. This class will help prepare you for the rest of your academic career, regardless of your field of interest or the length of your studies.Course Catalog Number:

J. Lillie Rather than focusing on a specific theme or genre, this course focuses on a wide range of writing styles, operating on the premise that you can’t write with style unless you know how to read it. Like many of the selected readings and films, the course’s goal is straightforward yet challenging: to consider how style and form convey substance and character in a text, and thereby learn to convey our own arguments stylishly. With that goal in mind, we will discuss works that all have highly self-conscious, unique, and lively written voices. Works for the reading and viewing lists were also selected for their provocativeness (to encourage valuable debate), for the extent to which they teach the reader how to read them and thus reward close reading, and for overall degree of fun and weirdness (always good indicators of a work that takes its style seriously). In addition to being written in unique (and sometimes notorious) styles, many incorporate style as a theme of the narrative itself, in which the freedoms and trappings of the written language play a crucial role. We’ll also play with our own styles through mimicry and invention (on paper) and by analyzing works through a variety of media (including in-class performances).Likely Readings:Films:Course Catalog Number:

K. AgbodikeThe notion that racial identity is socially constructed is by now a widely familiar one. Yet race continues to exert a powerful influence over how society is structured and how we view ourselves and others. If race cannot be meaningfully described as having a “real” biological or objective existence, why and how does it persist in shaping our social, cultural, and political practices? What exactly do we mean when we refer to race as a “social construct?” In this course we will discuss these questions by way of talking and writing about a series of texts  that take on the topic of race from a number of contexts and perspectives. We will be focusing on the question of the role literature has played in both the formation and questioning of racial identities, as well as the concept of race itself. A comparison of ancient and modern literature will allow us to ask whether there have always been racial forms of identity or whether they are specific to the modern era. The class will also consider the paradoxical tendency of literature to construct and define racial identities at the same time that it criticizes them and explores their problematic nature. Though we will be focusing on the particular case of blackness as a racial identity associated with the African Diaspora, a consideration of other identities and their interrelations will allow for a more wide-ranging discussion.ReadingsHerodotus, The Histories (selections)William Shakespeare, OthelloMachado de Assis, Dom CasmurroHerman Mellville, Benito CerenoAime Cesaire, Notebook of a Return to the Native LandChester Himes, If He Hollers Let Him GoV.

P. Brito & K. BudnerIt’s almost impossible to encounter a new cultural object or experience without unconsciously slipping it into some category or another. We take it to be a work of art or an occasion for entertainment, an expression of elite or popular taste, something real and refined or crass and commercial. In this class we’ll take a look at how these judgments of taste fit together and what’s at stake when we make them.Do these distinctions come about because of something special in the objects themselves or are they products of our cultural biases? By keeping these questions in mind as we look at a wide range of texts, both written and visual, we’ll be able to investigate why we consider certain kinds of texts worthy of being read and written about in a college setting.The central focus of this class will be to improve students’ capacity to articulate their interpretations of literary texts. The bulk of the papers will be on the assigned texts but there will also be opportunities for students to write about cultural objects of their choice.

Paul HaackeIn this class we will study works of fiction that revolve around rogues, tricksters, and outlaws, whether comic or tragic, sympathetic or monstrous. We’ll start with folktales, cartoons and picaresque satires, move on to naturalist novels and other narrative critiques of social mores, and also examine relevant theory and criticism that raise larger questions about rogue discourses. Particular attention will be paid to the period of economic boom and bust in the first half of the twentieth century and its implications for more current concerns. Topics for discussion will include narrative representation, irony and point-of-view; social inequality and mobility; power and tactics of resistance; ideology, cynicism and false consciousness; and the ethics and politics of recognition and redistribution.Through regular written assignments and in-class discussion, we will also work on developing skills for writing and revising argumentative, analytical essays. Requirements will include prompt attendance and participation, short writing responses on BSpace, a midterm essay analyzing course materials closely, and a longer research paper or independent project.Texts will be selected from among the following:Literary ReadingsSelected trickster tales of Hermes, Coyote, Krishna and Br’er RabbitAnonymous, Lazarillo de Tormes and Francisco de Quevedo, The SwindlerAnonymous, Journey to the West (abridged as Monkey: A Chinese Folktale)Molière, “Dom Juan”Daniel Defoe, Moll FlandersStendhal, The Red and the BlackNikolai Gogol, Dead SoulsOscar Wilde, “The Decay of Lying”George Bernard Shaw, “Man and Superman”Edith Wharton, The House of MirthF.

D. InciarteThe Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read critical essays that will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.

While the act of narration in general might fairly be called a kind of manipulation, this class will examine literary and filmic texts that explicitly play calculating and, more often than not, cruel games with their characters and/or readers. Whether these games are played out between characters, or between the text and reader, we will examine the dynamics of narrative manipulations ranging from plot arcs to conspiracy theories, storytelling to retelling, literary puzzles to thwarted expectations.These concerns pose a number of questions regarding the idea of plot and manipulation: How does plot as a literary device relate to the action of plotting? Consequently, how do characters that are plotters, schemers, and conspirators reflect upon the idea of authorship? How can those caught up in the plot – here we may think of characters explicitly framed as victims or investigators, or ourselves as readers – respond to these kinds of manipulation? What do works of fiction have to tell us about the differences (or similarities) between play and reality? Does one stay faithful to the other, or conversely, what can we learn from their distortions?Finally, this is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper. We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper. Requirements for the course include a library workshop, in-class presentation, and annotated bibliography.Texts may be chosen from among the following:Shakespeare, Twelfth NightBalzac, Le Père GoriotFreud, “Dora”Perkins Gilman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”Amis, Time’s ArrowPerec, W, or The Memory of Childhood Stoppard, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are DeadWelles (dir), Citizen KaneSinger (dir), The Usual SuspectsGondry (dir), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindHaneke (dir), Funny Games (1999 and/or 2007)Course Catalog Number:

I. PopescuSome texts rebel against a literary tradition, some against a political regime, and some against society as a whole. In this course we will consider works of fiction, film, music and photography, focusing particularly on their connections to rebellion and revolution. We will explore texts that explicitly deal with revolution and texts which deal with it on a metaphoric level. Together we will witness how literature and art work not only to provide awareness, but also as active agents with the power to incite national and global change.Students will be expected to contribute weekly blog entries on b-space, participate in class discussion and write and rewrite academic papers. In addition to the reading we will spend time revising, learning how to frame analytical arguments and use research material, peer-editing, and developing critical reading skills.Texts will include:William Shakespeare, The TempestKen Kesey, One Flew over the Cuckoo’s NestZora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching GodChinua Achebe, Things Fall ApartThere will also be a course reader which will include selected short stories, poems and critical pieces by Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges, Jose Marti, Pablo Neruda, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Norman Manea, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, Allen Ginsberg, and others.Course Catalog Number:

According to the philosopher Gottfried Liebniz, we live in “the best of all possible worlds.”  Whether or not that’s true, it hasn’t prevented us from ceaselessly imagining – or even creating – alternate realities: shiny fantasy worlds where our most cherished dreams come true or, when we’re feeling less optimistic, nightmarish dystopias where they are mercilessly crushed.  What constitutes a possible world or parallel universe?  How and why is it constructed?  By what rules is it governed?  Who or what inhabits it?  Where is it located in time and space – in our own backyard or in a distant galaxy, amidst our personal memories or a thousand years into the future?  How does it bring the “real world” – whatever that might be – into relief?  These are some of the questions we’ll be asking as we survey the possibilities and parallels presented by poets, philosophers, filmmakers, novelists, and science fiction writers.As this is a writing intensive course, a significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing a total of three papers: a two-page diagnostic essay and two longer essays, both of which require substantial revisions.  The final paper will incorporate independent research.  In addition, there will be a number of shorter assignments designed to hone your skills as critical readers and writers.

CCN: 17509Given the violent and tragic history of the Caribbean it is hardly surprising that many of the region’s greatest writers have sought to challenge historical injustice, and its legacy into the present, through literature. Some of the questions we shall consider in this course include: How does literature function as counter-history? How does writing resist historical erasure and oblivion? How do certain literary texts attempt to recover or re-imagine lost or suppressed histories? How can writing, rewriting, and “writing back” challenge or revise partial representations and misrepresentations of Caribbean history and subjectivity? And finally how does a radical engagement with the past open up new aesthetic and political possibilities for the present and future? This is a reading and writing intensive course with a research component that fulfills the second half of the University Reading & Composition requirement.Texts: The Tempest (Shakespeare), Une Tempête (Césaire), I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem (Condé), The Kingdom of this World (Carpentier), Wide Sargasso Sea (Rhys).

M. CudahyDeath, by murder, illness or suicide is the end result in many of literature’s most compelling stories of romantic love. From the topos of the fallen woman that permeates the 19th century novel, to the performances of awesome vengeance in Hedda Gabler and Medea, women heroines often take the brunt of society’s censure of “inappropriate” passion. The protagonists (both male and female) are always marked by their difference, which is often based on their willingness to confront society. They are somehow smarter, more interesting, more confused, and more demanding than everyone else. These tales inspire agile reading practices that incorporate an understanding of authorial, cultural and historical pressures at work in the formation of the text.In this course, you will be expected to write in a number of ways: 1) a 5-6 page paper and a 7-8 page research paper, both of which will be extensively edited and re-written, 2) one-page response papers, and 3) in-class freewriting. In addition, you will be responsible for group presentations on literary and historical issues that will be assigned in the beginning of the semester.Heinrich von Kleist, The Marquise von O-(reader)Theodore Fontane, Effie Briest ISBN-13: 978-0140447668Thomas Mann, Death in Venice (reader)Kate Chopin, The Awakening (reader)Hinrik Ibsen, Hedda Gabler ISBN-13: 978-0486264691Euripedes, Medea ISBN-13: 978-0872209237Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road ISBN-13: 978-0375708442Selected Poetry (reader)Lunsford/Connors, The Everyday Writer ISBN-13: 978-0312413231Gardner, Writing About Literature: A Portable Guide, ISBN-13 978-0312607579Course Catalog Number:

Brian ClancyWhat are the different binary oppositions that terms like representation and fiction tend to set up and how do different texts, and the novel in particular attempt to free our analytical thinking from oppositions like fiction vs. non-fiction and art vs. reality? How might we begin to understand the relationship between language and the world without seeing these respective spaces as being easily juxtaposed or spaces that are easily set apart? In this course, we wish to expand our understanding of the concept of fiction beyond the idea of stories about the world, plots with easily recognizable parts, as well as stories that make complete sense. How can we think about narrative beyond the idea of a story? In this course we will learn that the creative productions of fictional art are oftentimes quite vast in their scope while also seeing why it is difficult to set clear boundaries for what a literary text is about. We also hope to explore how literary form shifts dramatically over time. Beginning with texts in antiquity and the medieval period, this course will examine debates over concepts like mimesis, the transition from epic narrative into other literary forms, vernacular language, meta-narrative, and in particular the relationship between fictional language and the novel form, with an emphasis on novels written in the 20thcentury.Early in the course we hope to gain familiarity with different viewpoints on concepts like mimesis, plot, narrative temporality, verbal poetical structure, and the problem of referentiality. We will also examine throughout the course novelistic techniques such as characterization, narrative unreliability, and represented speech and thought. Here we will also consider the relationship between narrative and the representation of time, the relationship between fiction and epistemology, while examining historical shifts in the way in which the reader approaches narrative art epistemologically in the 20th century, with a particular focus later in the course on developments in the novel form during the 1920’s.Course texts:Aristotle, PoeticsMiguel de Cervantes, Don QuixoteJames Joyce, UlyssesVirginia Woolf, To the LighthouseVladimir Nabokov, LolitaFranz Kafka, The TrialCourse Catalog Number:

J. Raisch and J. Greenwald“Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t”-Proverb (Unknown Origin)In this class, we’ll explore encounters with the devil in novels, poetry, film, music, and drama. By tracing the literary tradition of representing the devil, we will examine various incarnations of the diabolic, from byronic hero, to cunning deceiver, to the embodiment of evil’s pervasive everyday power. Where does our conception of the devil originate? What contributes to the devil’s allure as a literary figure? What is at stake in representing the devil as a character? When does the devil cease to be literal and begin to be figural, and how do we understand this distinction? How does the idea of the devil manifest itself in a contemporary context? We’ll address these, and many other questions, through class discussion and written assignments.Course Catalog Number:

K. PalauCourse Description: From Columbus’ ‘discovery’ of the Americas to ongoing debates about immigration and labor, travel has played a significant role in Latin America’s story.  But what does it mean to travel? How does the experience of ‘taking a trip’ being ‘out of place,’ or encountering a ‘visitor’ have an impact on individuals, identities, and cultures?  How has Latin America been a site of travels in pursuit of personal roots and unchartered routes, but also a region touched by the unexpected ruptures that can emerge out of experiences of travel?In this course, we will take these questions as a point of departure for our own semester-long journey through a rich body of materials, visual and literary, all of which touch on the theme of travel in and from Latin America.  Beginning with Columbus’ Segunda Carta, we will consider how travel and cultural contact were seminal to the way Latin America came to be constructed historically.  But we will also examine a number of materials that explore the possibility for travel to break open and re-negotiate these kinds of constructed histories and identities.In our wanderings from descriptions of homecomings to touristy vacations, from journeys of ‘discovery’ to ethnographic missions, we will try to unpack the tensions inherent in questions of identity, movement, and the dynamics of cultural encounter that have played such an important role in shaping how the Latin American milieu has been both lived and imagined.Course prerequisite: This is an intensive writing course that fulfills the second half of the University Reading & Composition (R&C) requirement and is designed to help you continue to refine skills taught in an R1A course. We will build on the skills taught in R1A and dedicate ample time to crafting our critical thinking and essay-writing skills, giving special attention to argumentation, analysis, and the basics of how to put together a strong and convincing academic paper.  We assume that you have completed R1A or the equivalent at another institution and that you come ready to write longer, more complex papers and engage more difficult texts than those assigned in R1A.Language prerequisite: This is also a bilingual course designed to increase your language skills and familiarity with cultural production in Spanish.  Writing assignments will be in English, but we will read texts in the original and regularly conduct class discussions in Spanish. Students must have completed one of the following prerequisites: AP High School Spanish, score of 3 or higher on the AP Spanish exam, Spanish 4 or 25, or be a native Spanish speaker with adequate skills for the class.  A language exam will be given the first day of class.Writing Assignments: One four-page diagnostic essayOne six-page paper (with rewrite)One ten-page research paper (proceeded by outline & draft)Frequent short writing assignments on thesis statement, close textual analysis, outlining, etc.Possible Primary Readings and Viewings: (Please do not purchase books until after the first class session.

Professor Enrique LimaIn this course we will examine the development of “the West” as a historical and literary concept. We will investigate its role in the creation of American identities and as a space in which those identities may be contested and refigured. We will begin with Frederick Jackson Turner’s famous “frontier thesis.” The emptiness of the western frontier, argued Turner, was responsible for fostering the sense of individual responsibility that is at the core of American democracy. We will read Willa Cather’s Death Comes for the Archbishop as a complicated rewriting of the West as the territory of self and national formation. Death Comes illustrates the ways in which the West has been configured as the productive place in which people of European descent become Americans. Unlike Turner, Cather does not empty the West of non-White peoples. She does, however, minimize the conflict that underwrote Western expansion. The effects of that historical process are at the heart of D’Arcy McNickle’s Wind from an Enemy Sky. McNickle’s novel is keenly interested in the effects of colonial subjugation on surviving native communities. The legacies of historical violence, McNickle suggests, continue to shape the lives of Native Americans. Just as conquest created Native America as we know it so too did it create the analogous place of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans as subjects that have been incorporated as external to the nation-state that is their home. Ramón Saldívar’s The Borderlands of Culture, Américo Paredes’ George Washington Gómez, and Helena Viramontes’ Under the Feet of Jesus, one a critical/theoretical work, the other two novels, explore the meaning of the border on people of Mexican descent and on the very fabric of American culture. In the last section of the course we will turn to the history and aesthetics of violence as it relates to the West. Violence, Richard Slotkin argues in Regeneration Through Violence, is not just an Indian or a Mexican problem. Rather, he maintains, violence is one of the spiritual sources of American national identity broadly conceived. The western frontier has been conquered through violence and that violence, at once disavowed and sublimated, remains a determining feature of Americans’ vision of themselves. Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian is a profound and aesthetically dense meditation on the role of frontier violence on American culture. Leslie Marmon Silko’s Almanac of the Dead is another. Almanac refuses to recognize any of the national borders that cut through the West as violent colonial inventions. The West, this course maintains, has a privileged position in the imaginary geography of U.S. nationalism. It has often been configured as the open space of possibility, the place where pure individualism has had the space to explore its limits. But this imaginary geography as the course’s readings will show has just as often come in conflict with the historical West as a colonized territory that continues to be contested by Native Americans, Mexicans, Latinos, and Anglos.Course Catalog Number:

In this course we will study the construction of the self in Western literature (Ancient to Modern) across a variety of epochs, genres, and authors, ranging from the earliest texts in which protagonists tell about themselves (Homer, Odyssey) via foundational autobiographical texts as Augustine (Confessions), Rousseau (Confessions), or Nabokov (Speak Memory) to more complex constructions where author and character are identical, but situated in a clearly fictional realm.Key questions that will interest us include the relationship between self-narratives and literary genres or typical plots; the differences between inventing and disclosing a self; the tensions between memory/imagination and ‘truth’; the rhetorics of authenticity; the social, political, and cultural conditions that create the epistemic space for an ‘inner self’ to be revealed.We will also read some seminal texts from the theoretical literature on the self (M. Foucault; J. Butler) and use S. Smith/J. Watson (eds.), Reading Autobiography. A Guide for Interpreting Life Narratives.All texts will be read in English translation, but students are encouraged to study the works written in ‘their’ language(s) in the original. Most theoretical texts will be made available via bspace.Course requirements: two to three papers; active participation in class; keeping a reading journal; final exam.Course Catalog Number:

This course will study sexuality and gender in two very different historical periods–ancient Greece and 19th-century Europe.  Sexuality will be defined as including sexual acts (e.g. sodomy, pederasty, masturbation); sexual identities (e.g. erastes and eromenos); and sexual systems (e.g. kinship structures, subcultures, political hierarchies).  Readings and lectures will focus on situating queer sexualities relative to dominant organizations of sex and gender.  Topics will include Greek democracy and male homosexuality; the biology of sexual difference; the politics of sodomy; “romantic” friendship between women and men; and the emergence of strictly defined homosexual and heterosexual identities.  We will read literary texts along with historical documents and secondary readings to constitute a comparative analysis of ancient Greece and 19th-century Europe.Authors to be read include Hesiod, Sappho, Aeschylus, Plato, Wilde, Freud, and Foucault.There will be two papers and a final exam.  There will also be required weekly reading questions that will count towards your final grade.Course Catalog Number:

“Kafka and World Literature” explores ongoing debates about what world literature means through the lens of Kafka, who has played a significant role in them. From the earlier works that Kafka re-imagined, including the Odyssey, Don Quixote, and David Copperfield, to works that in some way react to or adapt Kafka’s work, this course will examine the ideas of world literature, literary traditions, and influence. Using different genres and media, such as film (Federico Fellini’s Intervista) and graphic novels (Art Spiegelman’s Maus) and authors from Europe (Svevo, Robbe-Grillet and Gogol), North America (Philip Roth), South America (Borges, Márquez, and Lispector), and Asia (Kobo Abe) the course covers a wide range of works which will aid the class in our discussion of world literature and Kafka’s work itself. This course invites students both to compare texts as well as to question what is lost and gained when comparing works across time periods, languages, and genres.Course Requirements: Active participation, frequent short responses, three short papers.Texts:Required Texts:Franz Kafka, The Sons 0805208860Franz Kafka, Amerika: The Man who Disappeared 0811215695Franz Kafka, The Trial 0805209999Clarice Lispector, Passion according to G.H. 0816617120Gabriel García Márquez, Chronicle of a Death Foretold 140003471XKobo Abe, The Woman in the Sand Dunes 0679733787Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jealousy 080215106XPhilip Roth, The Breast 0679749012Art Spiegelman, Maus 0394747232Suggested (the parts required will be available on-line):Albert Camus, The Stranger 0679720200Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote 0060934344J.M.

Professor Enrique LimaThe representation of the indigenous peoples of the Americas is one of the central issues of the literature of the hemisphere. From the need to justify and rationalize the genocide and displacement of native peoples, to the persistence of an ambivalent fascination with Indians, to the aesthetic experimentation with native epistemologies, and, finally, to the contemporary reassessment of Native social and literary history, the broad geographic and historical distribution of the contested representations of indigeneity is crucial for understanding the literature of the Americas. The novel, the great narrative form of capitalist modernity, has been equally at home in capital’s peripheries. Urban spaces and rural “backwardness,” free market relations and coerced labor, social progress and in Roberto Schwarz’ words “the regressive potentialities of modernization,” the plasticity of American—used here in the hemispheric sense—novel has been capable of representing such extremes. In this course we will read South, Central, and North American novelists in order to examine the relationship between the representation of indigeneity and the development of the novel in the Americas.Possible readings include: James Fenimore Cooper Last of the Mohicans, José María Arguedas Deep Rivers, Rosario Castellanos The Nine Guardians, Victor Montejo Mr. Putison’s Adventures Among the Maya, D’Arcy McNickle The Surrounded, and Louise Erdrich Tracks.Course Catalog Number:

M. KotzamanidouThis course examines certain aspects of the relationship between fascism and Greek fiction. From the 1930’s to the 1970’s, Greece experienced three different repressive fascist regimes: The dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas, the (Nazi) Occupation, and the military dictatorship of 1967. Fiction writers, dealing with that period, use prose fiction, particularly the novel, in order to make sense of the violent historical events and changes in political and social thought during those years. Trapped between exalting leftist ideologies and repressive fascism, the fiction of these writers points toward the theoretical perspectives of New and Modern Historicism which are being used as a reaction to repressive power structures. Thus, the position of these authors forces them to re-define the ways of writing historical and political fiction and ultimately to explore new aspects in the relationship between history and the novel.Readings in history and theory are available in English.Literary materials are available in Greek and in English translation.Films chosen for the course are subtitled in English.Course Catalog Number:

[Note: Students enrolling in this seminar will be assumed to have experience with the close reading and analysis of poetic form, content, and context, and to be at least somewhat familiar with  the main lines or moments in American poetry’s 19th-20thC. development, from Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, through the modernism  of  Eliot, Pound, Stevens, Moore, Hughes, Brooks, et al, the postmodernism of the Plath, Lowell, Sexton, the Beats, etc. ]This seminar will center on the work of the poets of what’s popularly called “The New York School”  (initially meant to connect the poetry to “New York  School”  Abstract  Expressionist and post-Abstract Expressionist painting).  Perhaps more than any other grouping within post-1945 American poetry, the New York School has–controversially–been termed “The Last Avant-Garde,” in the specific sense of being deemed the last trend within experimental American poetry to have captured “mainstream” attention and admiration. The New York School poets have in some ways become legendary: John Ashbery has pulled off the trick of consistently emerging, over the last few decades, at the heart of debates about “who is America’s `greatest’ living poet?” and as a favorite case study in the “difficulty” or “obscurity” of modern and contemporary poetry; Frank O’Hara’s poetry has, for better or worse, been seen to constitute an oeuvre that manages to seem simultaneously hip, spontaneous, accessible, and yet brilliant, philosophically weighty, and culturally (also perhaps politically) provocative; Barbara Guest  has been repeatedly mentioned as one of postmodern America’s most innovative, rigorous practitioners and re-makers of lyric art’s forms and structures and ambition to capture social experience that might otherwise escape apprehension; while James Schuyler has become a model for crystalline figurings of how the temporal experience of everyday life can yield genuine philosophical complexity.We’ll begin the seminar with brief but crucial readings in one of the international sources for much–though by no means all–of the New York School’s poetic education: the tradition of modern French poetry and poetics that extends from Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Mallarmé through the French surrealists; readings will be mostly of the English translations of these poets, though we’ll work with facing-page French/English editions, and we’ll pay some attention to the prosody of the original French texts. [Students will not be required to have reading knowledge of French,] We’ll then spend the bulk of the semester closely and carefully reading the poetry and criticism of and about the above-mentioned New York School poets (with special emphasis on poetic form and its experimental attempts to engage sociopolitical, cultural, and historical reality, and on the question of what does–or doesn’t–make certain kinds of poetry or poetic form aesthetically, socially, culturally, or politically “avant-garde”). Via the New York School’s own writings and other texts of criticism, theory, and aesthetics, we’ll think about New York School poetry’s relations to the French, British, and American poetry that precedes and influences it, as well as its conversations with the international poetry (and related art) contemporaneous with it, from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and Europe.  We’ll spend significant time thinking about the importance of Abstract Expressionist and post-Abstract Expressionist painting to the New York School poets, and we’ll therefore look at some of that painting and the art criticism and theory that has engaged it, including art criticism by the New York School poets themselves.  Finally, we’ll glance at the “second generation and after” New York School poets, as well as poets adjacent to and in conversation with the New York School, including Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Bill Berkson (who’ll visit our seminar), Bernadette Mayer, Ron Padgett, Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, and Eileen Myles.Course Catalog Number:

Professor B. SpackmanThis course will examine a selection of travel narratives within the context of contemporary postcolonial theory and “mobility studies.”  Throughout the course, we will be acquainting ourselves with recent theoretical work on travel, Orientalism, and tourism.  Readings of primary texts will begin with a glance backward to Marco Polo’s thirteenth-century account of his travels to the East and Columbus’s account of what he thought was his voyage to the East, as well the early modern accounts of the voyages of discovery by Bartolome de Las Casas and Jean de Léry. We will then shift to a selection of modern travel narratives, both fictional and non-fictional.  Questions to be addressed include: the relation between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.   How does travel contribute to the construction of a place called “home,” and how might it disrupt that construction? What happens to Orientalist discourse when the Orientalist who enters and exits the harem happens to be a woman? What fantasy compels Europeans to find “cannibalism” in the East and the New World, over and over again? Authors read will include Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Bartolome de Las Casas, Jean de Léry, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Mark Twain, Xavier de Maistre, and Italo Calvino.  We will also read theoretical work by Said, Greenblatt, Culler, Kaplan, Pratt, Hulme, and others.Course Catalog Number:

Professor Chana KronfeldThis seminar will focus on lyrical poetry produced in the margins – or outside of — the modern Anglo-European canon in order to call into question static typological theories of genre, as well as what may be a majoritarian, heteronormative or Eurocentric set of biases behind contemporary attacks on the lyric as solipsistic, apolitical “personal expression.” Participants will draw on their own cultural and linguistic specialties to compile a multi-lingual course Reader of modern lyrical poetry marginalized by gender, sexuality, class, race, place or language. My own contribution to the readings will include selections from bilingual anthologies of Yiddish and Hebrew poetry, and examples of biblical poetry as an alternative model of the lyric, in which the distinction between the personal and the collective, the political and the “apolitical” is rendered meaningless. Through a series of historically and linguistically informed close readings, we will examine both standard and non-normative theoretical studies of the lyric, maintaining a critical awareness of the extent to which our paradigm examples affect our understanding of the genre. Questions we may want to ask include: How does the view from the margins problematize such western commonplaces as the coherence and authority of the lyrical “I,” the subject-object divide, the dichotomy between apostrophe and address, the conflation of the “lyrical” and “subjective” with the “feminine,” or the lyric’s purported freedom — or flight! — from the historical and the social?Requirements: The seminar group will compile a Reader of modern lyrics as well as cultural and theoretical background materials relevant for the participants’ different languages of specialization. 1 in-class presentation and 1 seminar paper.

Profs. Albert R. Ascoli and Timothy Hampton Also offered as Italian Studies 215 (4 units only)  SEMINAR IN RENAISSANCE LITERATURE AND CULTURE   The period that we now (usually) call the Renaissance saw the emergence of the modern “national” vernacular languages and literatures as vehicles of “high culture” and socio-political institutions.  It also witnessed a movement, usually known as humanism, dedicated to the recovery, study, and appropriation of the ancient languages—first “classical” Latin (as against the ecclesiastical idiom that had emerged over the course of the middle ages), then Greek, eventually Hebrew, “Chalcydean,” and other tongues. The problem of language in the Renaissance touches every aspect of life: the relations between the social classes, the interactions between Church and an increasingly prominent “secular” domain, the discourse of nationhood and ethnic identity, the encounters—imperializing, missionary, or otherwise—with non-European populations, and so on and on. In this course we will introduce the question of Renaissance multilingualism as it emerges historically (from Dante’s early defense, in Latin, of the “illustrious vernacular” as political and poetic language to the contemptuous ‘push-back’ of Latin humanism, to the emergence of prestige vernacular literatures—still modeled on the classics—in the sixteenth century); as it affects different geographical areas differently, while constituting the vehicle of communication between them (most notably, Italy, France, Spain, England, Germany); and as it permeates the most fundamental aspects of individual and collective life (religion; law; colonialism; class-relations; court-culture; and so on and on). At the heart of the course throughout will be the encounters among multiple languages within the experience and writing of key individuals and groups.  We will be interested, not only in the literary implications for major writers of the new linguistic multiplicity that haunts the Renaissance, but also in the institutions and agents that help shape the emergence of linguistic variety–copyists, printers, ambassadors, mariners, vagabonds. Among the authors whom we might consider, depending on the makeup of the group and the contours of our discussions, will be: Dante, Petrarch, St. Catherine,  Alberti, Ariosto, Machiavelli, Rabelais,  Du Bellay, Garcilaso, Luther, Wyatt, Montaigne, Shakespeare, and Cervantes Course Conducted in English Reading Knowledge of Italian, French, Spanish, or Latin desirableCourse Requirements: Students are expected to attend and participate regularly.  There will be occasional in-class presentations and some shorter writing assignments.  The principal assignment for the course is a research paper of ca. 6000 words (20-25 pages), an advanced draft of which will be presented to the seminar during the final weeks of the semester.  Topics must be closely related to the concerns of the course although they may focus on authors, texts and issues not directly treated in seminar.Course Catalog Number:

Professor Michael LuceyIn this seminar we will be pursuing those aspects of meaning that occur not “in” texts but in between them – meaning that is to be found in the uses that  texts make of other texts, and that readers make of texts, in the histories that accumulate around texts and their different uses, in the histories also of their transmission and circulation.We could say that during the seminar we will investigate the ground between two assertions Bakhtin makes in “The Problem of Speech Genres.”  Early in that essay he comments: “the novel as a whole is an utterance just as rejoinders in everyday dialogue or private letter are.”  A bit later he observes: “Utterances are not indifferent to one another, and are not self-sufficient; they are aware of and mutually reflect one another . . . . Every utterance must be regarded primarily as a response to preceding utterances . . . . Each utterance refutes, affirms, supplements, and relies on the others, presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account.”  We will thus be interested in the particular kinds of “conversations” that link text-utterance to text-utterance, texts to users, texts to the uses that come to be made of them.  Reconstructing those conversations will involve us in careful thinking about different dynamic forms of contextualization, and about what is referred to as the indexical functioning of language: the way language produces meaning not simply semantically, but by drawing on other, prior uses of language.Specifically, we will think about how novels make use of other novels through a reading of a set of novels that could be said to be mutually involved in a number of different conversations: about novelistic form, about the ambitions novels might have to be instruments of knowledge, about the kinds of knowledge novels might want to be able to produce.  We’ll be particularly interested in sociological and aesthetic forms of knowledge and the relations novels produce between them.The novels we will look at are Scott’s Waverley, Balzac’s Les Chouans, Cooper’s The Pilot, Eliot’s Felix Holt, Proust’s A l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleur, and Woolf’s To the Lighthouse.  (You are welcome to read in translation.)  We’ll accompany our reading of the novels with readings of a wide range of theorists and critics including Bakhtin, Lukács, Benedict Anderson, Franco Moretti, Catherine Gallagher, Margaret Cohen and others.Course Catalog Number:

Professor Anne-Lise Francois A comparative course exploring the intersections of literature, psychoanalysis, queer studies, and environmental studies.Popular environmentalist discourse is often portrayed as the province of misanthropes, lonely-hearts and “kill-joys,” whose “downer” ethics can only be articulated in the negative—as the demand to curb and curtail hedonistic consumption.   This course asks about the odd place of pleasure and desire in environmental literature broadly defined. What kinds of “romances” can be sustained with something called “nature” or with particular places or nonhuman others?  We will give special attention to stories that deviate from the dominant myth of an original fall from paradise and lost plenitude, and that re-imagine ideas of normalcy, home, and community.  Drawing on the multiple senses of “queer,” from its contemporary usage as a term for same-sex sexual orientation to its older meanings (“odd,” “deviant,” “of questionable character,” “oblique”), we will look at texts that break the normative yoking of sexuality to reproduction and offer alternatives lines of transmission and inheritance. We will compare different ways of thinking the relation between “madness” and “civilization” and of imagining community between humans and with other living beings.  We will also examine the surprising convergence of figures of secrecy, shame and lack—from “the gay closet” to the idea of nature as an “open secret”—in queer, gender and environmental studies.Readings by Bersani, Butler, Carson, Coleridge, Darwin, Deleuze, Edelman, Erikson, Foucault, Freud, Hadot, Haraway, Jewett, Kropotkin, Morton, Malthus, Ovid, Rousseau, Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, Silverman, Thoreau, Winnicott, William Wordsworth.Films by Hitchcock, Ang Lee, Herzog, Varda.Course Catalog Number:

K. KadueWhen chastity works, nothing happens. A story centered on the absence of sex might not sound like much of a story at all, but chastity, along with its sister virtues of modesty and moderation, has long been a hot topic for hit plays and best-selling novels.In this course, we will see what happens, or doesn’t happen, when men and women try to control women’s (and, less often, men’s) bodies, and when chastising husbands get chastened themselves. We will meet pious “revirginators” and impotent schoolmasters, ice princesses and coy mistresses, cuckolds and cads, and multiple virgins who turn into trees. We will ask what cultural obsessions with preserving sexual purity have to do with discourses of public morality, public health, and environmentalism. We will try not to get frustrated when texts don’t easily surrender their meanings, and we will even try to think of reading as something other than forcing texts to give something up to us.This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on the salutary self-chastening process of revision, and students will be asked to complete short creative writing assignments as well as formal analytical essays.Potential texts include:Aristophanes, LysistrataSophocles, Oedipus the KingOvid, MetamorphosesKempe, The Book of Margery KempeShakespeare, OthelloMilton, ComusMolière, The School for WivesLafayette, The Princess of ClèvesGoethe, Elective AffinitiesJoyce, “A Painful Case”Lorca, The House of Bernarda AlbaDiaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Waoselected poems by Ronsard, Shakespeare, Donne, Herrick, Marvell,Shelley, HopkinsFilm:Sembène, Xala (1975)Heckerling, Clueless (1995)Herzog, Grizzly Man (2005)Course Catalog Number:

S. ScalaFlip through the cable channels and it’s easy to see that we, as a culture, are very interested in other people’s homes. From Hoarders, where we can gawk at other people’s misfortunes, to the home makeover reality shows on HGTV, you could spend a few hours a day peeping into others’ private spaces.What’s so interesting about these spaces? Is our pleasure purely voyeuristic? What can you learn about other people from their homes? To explore these questions, we’ll peek into characters’ houses and apartments, both in text and on film. The course will focus on urban interiors, allowing us to examine the relationship between intimate interiors and public city streets. We’ll be asking whether there is a specific literature of apartments and apartment buildings, and move towards articulating the relationship between interior and exterior in these works. Students will respond to these questions through active class discussion and guided writing assignments (culminating in a research paper).Course Catalog Number:

Thow“Every time I bat my eyelashes it’s a political statement.”–RupaulDrag queens are not known for their subtlety.  But tucked away underneath the bedazzled outfit and the painted face is a scathing critique of gender categories.  You think a girl should have curves?  Well, it’s just a question of a little padding.  Eyelashes that can wink seductively?  All it takes is a few tricks from a make-up bag.  Should a lady sparkle?  Then my dress will be covered from head to toe in sequins.  The drag queen deconstructs the concept of femininity, embellishing and eventually reproducing the elements that “organically” or “naturally” belong to women in general.  Through exaggeration, drag reminds us how every element of gender is in some way constructed.  It forces us to think about the way we attach meanings to the body.In this class, we’ll be looking at texts that hinge on a drag performance, understood here in a broad sense as a moment in which male or female cross-dressing becomes a vehicle for critique.  We’ll be exploring how drag calls attention to the “constructedness” of assumed categories, gender or otherwise.  Our sources will come from a variety of historical periods, and it will be our task to understand what is at stake in each drag performance.  What does it mean for a woman to perform as a man in a particular historical moment, and vice-versa?  How is drag linked to questions of desire, both queer and heterosexual?  In what way is every drag performance political?Furthermore, we’ll be looking at drag not only as an object of study, but also as a metaphor for our own reading practice—what we’ll call “close reading.”  If it is true, as Erasmus states, that “clothing is to the body as style is to thought,” we’ll use drag to interrogate what makes each text uniquely “form-fitting.”  As readers and writers, we’ll consider our cultural objects as performances in their own right, with drag providing a model for us to think about the complex relations between form and content.Texts will be chosen from the following:Euripides, The BacchaeAriosto, Orlando FuriosoShakespeare, Twelfth NightCatalina De Erauso, Lieutenant NunRachilde, Monsieur VénusBalzac, SarrasineGeorge Moore, Albert NobbsDavid Henry Hwang, M.

B. ClancyIn everyday life, we seem to know an object when we see it, perhaps less when we hear it, but our senses don’t usually have a tendency to fool us, and far less often do they baffle us. In contrast, it happens quite often in literature that a clear and reliable relationship between sensation and perception does not exist. This course focuses on literary works after 1600 where the senses are not what they seem, where the interpretation of sensation through perception is radically different than what it might be in reality. Indeed literature might often be considered as a world where sensations become strange and perception somewhat astounding, or even terrifying. We will therefore look at how the relationship between the human senses and perception takes a radically different form in literature and the effect that this has on our understanding of these human faculties. What is the value of a literary world where the senses are not what they seem or where they seem to create altogether new objects? Here we might also consider themes like madness and magic, as well as philosophical terms like sense-data. In exploring these pressing literary issues, a large amount of analytical writing will be performed in this course. We will learn how to perform sophisticated close-readings of the assigned texts while examining the literary techniques that authors use in the exploration of the human senses. We will then learn how to interpret specific passages and form original arguments on the basis of our close-readings.Required texts:Aristotle, The PoeticsMiguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (this text will be read in selections)Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil Bertrand Russell, The Problems of PhilosophyJames Joyce, Ulysses (this text will be read in selections)Alain Robbe-Grillet, The Voyeur    Course Catalog Number:

S. CochranIn this course we will explore literature of transformation: texts in which characters, or entire communities, undergo some change of form or change of mind.  Something in these characters, plots, or even narrative structures gets rearranged or reconfigured.  We’ll think, too, about how literature can sometimes ask us to become different as readers, in order to interact with a text at all.  Exploring the topic of metamorphoses, even revolutions (internal ones and external sociopolitical ones too) can help us reconsider our assumptions about reading and interpretation, including how we interpret the world around us.  As we try changing the way we read—exploring different ways of approaching fictional works—we’ll discuss how we might look differently at the most basic structures and value systems in place in our own minds and in the political and human relations that surround us.Considering how our own ideas can transform, we’ll focus especially on the processes of brainstorming and revision in our writing: how changing the language of our thoughts can change the thoughts themselves.  This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, and research.Franz Kafka, “The Metamorphosis”Ovid, Metamorphoses (selections)Charlotte Perkins Gillman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”Aeschylus, AgamemnonShirley Jackson “We have always lived in the Castle”Nella Larsen, PassingJane Campion, The Piano (film)David Lynch, Mulholland Drive (film)Selected poems of Gottfried Benn, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton Course Catalog Number:

L. WagnerIn this course we’ll consider texts that reflect on and interrogate the act of storytelling in which they and their characters are engaged.  Each of the texts we’ll examine, whether a fairy tale or work of literary theory, Renaissance drama or Romantic poem, graphic novel or novel of ideas, is interested in the act of communication between storyteller and listener, or writer and reader, that characterizes the sharing of a story.  We’ll think about what forms these stories take when they come to us on the page or the stage and consider what’s at stake in the choice to tell a story in a particular way.  We’ll look at the relationship between stories and physical space, narrative and the self, and speech and the written word; we’ll question the ethics and politics of telling or receiving a story; we’ll interrogate the relationship between stories, memory, history, and trauma; and we’ll consider what happens to stories when language reaches its limits and communication break down.  Most importantly, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading, basic research, and analytical writing skills, learning to become careful readers of stories of all types and to better shape the critical stories that we tell in writing our own interpretations of literary texts. Required texts: The Tempest, William ShakespeareEmbassytown, China MiévilleTexaco, Patrick ChamoiseauMaus, Art Spiegelman“Max Ferber,” The Emigrants, W.G.

I. Popescu & C.  SchollWhat are human rights? How did this concept begin and where? How can literature engage with human rights as a discourse and a practice? In this course we will be reading/viewing texts that deal with the issue of human rights through a variety of genres and media: graphic novels, novels, plays, poems, songs, photographs, and films. We will begin to explore how aesthetics and the manipulation of genre work on us as readers of texts that often deal with traumatic historical events. How do literature, film, and photography manipulate a reader’s empathy? What role have these genres and media played in calling such sentiments into being and normalizing them? The texts we read will come from several geographical regions and historical periods, and one of our tasks will be to critically evaluate distinct, sometimes problematic articulations of human rights as we begin to formulate a more global definition and understanding of them. In addition to literary texts, then, we will also read theoretical essays by scholars from Plato to Lynn Hunt to help us understand how literature contributes to the human rights discussion and vice versa.Readings may include: Narrative of a Life of Fredrick Douglass, Anil’s Ghost by Michael Ondaatje, Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman, Maus (a Graphic Novel) by Art Spiegelman, short stories and/or poems by Julio Cortazar, Sherman Alexie, Americo Paderes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Maya Angelou, and Pablo Neruda, among others. Course Catalog Number:

J. CaballeroFor the Spanish-speaking population of America, in particular those populations intent on staying the rest of their lives, the classroom is a very loaded site for discussions of identity, assimilation, agency and citizenship.  Perhaps this is because many immigrants brought with them a Latin American ideology that puts education at the core of citizenship and the national project.  Or perhaps this conception of the high school as a factory for identities and a battleground to determine which identities can be recognized is as American as apple pie.  Regardless of the origins of these ideas, they’ve become a burning question in contemporary American politics, with state legislatures banning books and attacking tenured faculty to prevent the wrong histories or identities from being taught.  In this course, we’ll study various examples of the Latino Bildungsroman, looking at how innocuous fictions about getting zits and being late to gym class could become so hotly contested.Note: This course has an intensive formal writing component, a research component, and an average weekly reading load of approximately 100 pages.Book List–          Gloria Anzaldúa, Borderlands (2012 edition – 1879960850 )–          Patrick Chamoiseau, Schooldays (1997 – 0803263767)–          Junot Diaz: Oscar Wao (2007 – 1594483299)–          Richard Rodriguez: Hunger for Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez (1982 – 0553382519)–          Esmerelda Santiago, “When I Was Puerto Rican” (1993 – 0679756760 )–          William Shakespeare: The Tempest (No Fear edition – 1586638491)Possible Films and Excerpts–          Frontierland (Jesse Lerner/Ruben Ortiz, 1995)–          Quinceañera (Glazer/Westmoreland, 2005)–          Mur Murs (Agnes Varda, 1981, 85min, featuring the A.S.C.O. performance art troupe)Shorter pieces and elective readings likely to include:–          Rodolfo Acuña, “The Stairway to the Good Life,” from Anything But Mexican: Chicanos in Contemporary Los Angeles (1995) and excerpts from Occupied America: a history of Chicanos (2004 edition)–          Junot Diaz: excerpts from This is How You Lose Her (2012)–          Guillermo Gomez-Peña, excerpts from Warrior for Gringostroika (1993) and New World Border (1996)Course Catalog Number:

Jenny TanHow do we talk about books that talk about books? Why do we do it, and what can we learn from it? In this class, we will examine texts that are explicitly concerned with textual processes in some form or fashion: texts that depict and problematize acts of reading and writing, texts that talk about their own authorship and production, and texts that respond to and interact with other texts. By doing so, we will build up and develop our own vocabularies and conceptual toolboxes for discussing literary texts and analyzing how they produce meaning.This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments.Reading ListItalo Calvino, If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler

M. Gordon & K. BudnerThis course will deal with scams, schemes, and conspiracies, from bloody revenges to amorous pursuits to government takeovers. We’ll look at these plots from a number of angles: What, if anything, motivates the masterminds behind them? By what means are they carried out? What are their moral, legal, or personal consequences? We will also consider some of the broader issues plotting raises: Does plotting reflect a fundamental desire to exercise free will? When does an innocent plan become a devious plot? Can a plot ever be deemed necessary or legitimate? And finally, we will explore our core definition of plot as scheme in relation to its other definitions—as land, as chart, and most importantly, as the main action of a text.As this is a writing intensive course, a significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing and revising a total of three papers: a two-page diagnostic essay and two longer essays. In addition, there will be a number of shorter assignments designed to hone your skills as critical readers, researchers, and writers. At the end of the semester, you will present a multimedia group project, showcasing an original interpretation of one or more of our texts.  Course Catalog Number:

J. NelsenDoes a text “speak”? How, and to whom, do the words on a page make their unique voices heard? In this course, we will attempt to pinpoint and define some of the different voices that come together to create a work of literature. Our investigation will begin with a few mythical and infernal depictions of haunting songs and sounds that tell their stories in seductive and disturbing ways. In our readings of lyric poetry, we’ll explore how we might characterize the speaking “I” and the different interlocutors he or she engages. From ventriloquism to radio to futuristic talking machines, we’ll also consider various distortions and disruptions of the spoken voice and how these get transposed onto the literary text. Beyond these specific questions, we will of course consider each text on its own terms, paying attention to how its multiple voices intertwine with other central, complex themes and motifs. Throughout the semester, students will hone their own critical and analytical voices with regular writing assignments, revision exercises and in-class presentations.Readings will include:Homer, selections from The Odyssey-Dante, selections from InfernoWoolf, Mrs. DallowayCésaire, Notebook of a Return to the Native LandSelected poems by Sappho, Petrarch, Gaspara Stampa, Robert Browning,Emily Dickinson, T.S.

B. RubergThe girl-child, as we find her in literature, embodies far more than sugar, spice, and everything nice She is simultaneously the gateway of the imagination, inspiring (mostly male) authors to project themselves into her daydreams and create whole new, surreal worlds. She is likewise the object of erotic fascination: corruptible, enigmatic, ripe for the picking. At the same time, she becomes a powerful figure for (mostly female) authors seeking to reinstate her sexual agency; they show us a version of the girl-child who is herself desirous, playful but quick-witted, and self-aware.This course will use texts such as Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Nabokov’s Lolita, and Duras’ The Lover to examine, through literature, girlhood as a construct, a retelling, and a fantasy. We will close read graphic novels, video clips and visual art as well as short stories, novels, and plays. Creative activities will supplement analysis. Be aware that we will cover and discuss potentially sensitive material, such as sexuality. Since this course is an R1B, we will focus not only on reading but also on writing and research. Students should come prepared for daily writing workshops and extensive revision.Reading ListAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis CarrollA Young Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil, Max ErnstLost Girls, Melinda Gebbie and Alan MooreHow I Learned to Drive, Paula VogelLolita, Vladimir NabokovEugénie de Franval, Marquis de SadeThe Lover, Marguerite DurasCourse Catalog Number:

K. Dodson“The mouth, tongue, and teeth find their primitive territoriality in food. In giving themselves over to the articulation of sounds, the mouth, tongue, and teeth deterritorialize. Thus, there is a certain disjunction between eating and speaking, and even more, despite all appearances, between eating and writing.” So write Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In this course, we will explore the disjunctions and connections between food, eating, speaking, and writing. How does eating extend beyond its bodily function to express and influence social relations, cultural and religious practices, aesthetic experience, and political and ethical considerations?Through examining texts in which food or the act of eating plays a central role, we will consider 1) the relationship between food, pleasure, and rituals of society; 2) literary and cultural appropriations of gastronomic metaphors, such as cannibalism, raw and cooked cultures, and analogies of consumption, digestion, and circulatory networks; 3) the political and ethical tensions embedded in what we choose to eat and how our food is produced.This course will also focus on developing students’ critical reading and analytical essay writing skills. Students should be prepared to participate actively in class discussion and group work. Assignments will range from shorter written analyses and creative responses to two argumentative essays based on careful textual analysis, one 6-page paper and one 10-page research paper.Readings:“Poor Man’s Pudding” and “Rich Man’s Crumbs,” Herman MelvilleThe Alice B.

S. SchneiderWriting can be considered a heroic task in that the writer navigates a space and experience and serves as guides for the next to come, directing their attention at certain sights and sounds. In fact, writing shares much with space-building and architecture. Many of the texts and films we will read foreground their made-ness by incorporating multiple layers of media and perspective, as well as encouraging flexibility and plasticity in their readers.As this is a writing intensive course, many of our activities will be dedicated towards sharpening your awareness of environmental cues and their relationship to your reactions and feelings. You will then explore these correlations in your prose using precise examples from the text. Assignments include a diagnostic paper, a 6-7 page analytical paper and a 10-page research paper. The two larger papers will include a draft and the final paper, and we will place a major emphasis on the process of revision. Other assignments include approximately bi-weekly bSpace postings, group presentations, a final, independent presentation and in-class writing exercises. Course ObjectivesThis is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper. We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper.Books N.B.

R. LorenzThis course will explore the interplay of drama and tedium in day-to-day life. All of the works we will read eschew a purely heroic or marvelous mode and instead focus on petty concerns or mundane experience. But these texts do so in a way that is far from ordinary or boring; each offers a distinct creative perspective on everyday life. Some of the works we’ll read highlight the intense and dramatic undercurrents of routine existence. For example, Virginia Woolf “tunnels” deep into the inner life of a middle-aged woman who views each day as a “dangerous” feat; Nikolai Gogol turns a bureaucrat’s quest for a new coat in a darkly humorous, overblown farce; and Emily Dickinson, although she hardly left her room, wrote poetry suffused with extremes of despair, exultation, passion, faith and doubt. Other texts take the opposite approach, underlining the contrast between our romantic dreams and the monotony of daily experience. Euripides, for example, will show us how a heroic quest deteriorates into bickering and jealousy; Platonov, one of the most remarkable writers of the Soviet era, portrays the tragic failure of utopian hopes; and Chekhov’s plays offer masterful depictions of lassitude and gradually fading ambition. As we read each text, we’ll discuss how it illuminates the intertwined monotony and intensity of everyday experience, but we’ll also move beyond the course topic to read each text for its own sake, paying attention to multiple prominent themes and motifs. We will also devote substantial class time to instruction in argumentative writing and research skills. As in all R&C courses, you will write several papers. The ultimate goal of the course is to develop your critical thinking and writing skills as well as your ability to enjoy the creative complexity of literary texts.Texts:Platonov, The Foundation PitWoolf, Mrs. DallowayChekhov, The SeagullGogol, “The Overcoat”Dickinson, selected poetryEuripides, MedeaCourse Catalog Number:

P. Brito & J. VakninThis class is about texts that want to take in entire worlds. It’s about stories, novels, and poems that aspire to the comprehensiveness of encyclopedias. This ambition gives them a strange, hybrid quality: the way that they catalog and communicate vast quantities of information often makes them seem more like non-literary texts than what we traditionally think of as literature. They will allow us to think about the often-complicated relationship between fiction and non-fiction, to consider the many ways in which texts connect both to the “real world” and to one another, and to reflect on what it means to read literature at a time when seemingly everything worth knowing is instantly available on the Internet.First and foremost, however, this is a writing course. It will be focused on the process of writing–on the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader.Readings will be drawn from the following:Stories by Jorge Luis BorgesThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot DíazThe Waste Land by T.S.

We will think through questions concerning the consequences of industrialization, gender relations, and the conditions needed to bring about a just society, among others. We will watch several contemporary films, and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on utopian fiction and sci-fi. We will consider some of the following questions: under what social conditions an “alternative world” becomes desirable? What do we mean by “world” and what might be its opposites? What role do literary form and genre have in constructing an alternative world? What kind of attitude do we adopt vis à vis such texts whose implicit or explicit aim is to be “more” than an imaginary experiment?Books RequiredThomas More, UtopiaIsaac Asimov, Prelude to FoundationCourse ReaderFilmsWachowski Brothers, Matrix IJean-Luc Godard, Alphaville  Course Catalog Number:

In his “Institutes of Oratory,” Quintillian explains the importance of imitatio: “a great portion of art consists in imitation, since, though to invent was first in order of time and holds the first place in merit, it is of advantage to copy what has been invented with success.”   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17278

Imitatio, the Latin word for “imitation,” was an important literary and rhetorical principle in ancient Rome. In his “Institutes of Oratory,” Quintillian explains the importance of imitatio: “a great portion of art consists in imitation, since, though to invent was first in order of time and holds the first place in merit, it is of advantage to copy what has been invented with success.” To learn to speak well, one had to train oneself by imitating more accomplished orators. In the Renaissance, imitatio was taken up as a pedagogical tool, and students and scholars painstakingly copied and mimicked ancient writings in order to become great stylists themselves. In this class, “imitation” will bring together three different strands of study. In the first place, an introduction to poetry, one of the most fertile grounds of imitation. Taking the classical period (primarily in Latin), the continental Renaissance, the Romantic period and the contemporary periods as our touchstones, we will trace the most important poetic forms – the sonnet, the epic, the ode, and free verse – through the poetic tradition, seeing how writers imitated each other. In order to understand historical practices of writerly imitation, but also to understand poetry from the inside out, we will write our own imitations of the poets we read for class. This writing practice will transition nicely with the second goal of the class, to acquaint students with the skills necessary for researching and writing academic papers. Thirdly, we will take a broad view of imitatio, looking at the ways imitation has been an important practice in religion (“imitatio christi,” for example), art (schools of painters, fakes), and contemporary culture (plagiarism, lip-syncing, Elvis impersonators). Readings will include selections from the following authors and works:Mary Oliver, Rules for the Dance, A Poetry Handbook, Gordon Braden, Petrarchism; Thomas à Kempis, Imitation of Christ; Aristotle, Poetics; Quintillian, Institutes of Oratory, and poems by Bishop, Celan, Collins, Dickinson, Donne, Emerson, Gongora, H.D., Hopkins, Horace, Jonson, Keats, Lucretius, MacLeish, Mallarmé, Millay, Milton, Moore, Petrarch, Pope, Pound, Quevedo, Rilke, Rimbaud, Sexton, Shakespeare, Shelley, Sidney, Spenser, Stevens, Tennyson, Valéry, Verlaine Virgil, Whitman, Wyatt, and Yeats.Course Catalog Number:

J. RaischAlthough originally coined as a medical condition (literally “homesickness”), nostalgia has come to describe a usually harmless, and deeply sentimental, longing for the past. In this class, we’ll think about the transformation of this concept from the medical to the emotional, as well as its connection to ideas of both home and history. Just how harmless is nostalgia? Does nostalgia keep us grounded and attached to where we come from or does its sentimentality necessarily distort our vision? What is it about an unattainable time or place that seems so appealing? By reading texts and viewing films that either represent nostalgia at work or are clearly employing a nostalgic lens, we’ll think, discuss, and write about what provokes nostalgia and why.Texts and films will include:Homer, OdysseyWilliam Shakespeare, The TempestMarcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time (selections)Steven Spielberg, Jurassic ParkGary Ross, PleasantvilleWoody Allen, Midnight in Paris And a course reader will additionally include selections from: Ovid, Hesiod, Theocritus, Joachim Du Bellay, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, William Wordsworth, Novalis, Alfred Lord Tennyson, various Pre-Raphaelites, and Sigmund Freud. Course Catalog Number:

M. KotzamandiouIn 1844 the American sculptor Hiram Powers unveiled, in Boston, his nude statue, the first full scale American nude, by the title “The Greek Slave”. The fictional identity given to the subject, as stated in the pamphlet accompanying the tour of the statue in 1848, was that of a beautiful young Greek woman chained to a column, completely naked, ready to be sold in the Ottoman slave market. Since by 1844, the Greek War of Independence, which had effectively ended in 1827, had produced a miniscule, though free, European nation, images of chained bodies, replete with a background of Turkish violence, did not, exactly, represent the Greek historical reality.  The critical responses to the exhibit insisted that the statue, classical in style, reflected pathos rather than seduction. The woman, the newspapers wrote, was, clearly, Greece itself suffering in barbaric hands.  Since the statue continued to be reproduced through the 1860’s, the American public accepted it also as a part of the abolitionist discourse of slavery in the American society of the North, the fledgling feminist movement accepted it as an example of man’s oppression of women, and the Europeans accepted it as an image of the rhetoric of orientalism and Turkish barbarism still hovering about the sad remnants of the erstwhile powerful Ottoman Empire.Using the above materials as a springboard, this course intends to examine the relationship between the body and politics, between art, sexuality and nation, exemplified by the use of the female body in literature and film. The use of the woman’s body as a trope continues to reflect the national and nationalist politics in Greek literature and film in the 20th century.Please note:  There are no prerequisites for this course.  Course Catalog Number: 17350

H. RamLiterature has always been linked to fantasy and magic, even as it has sought to imitate or approximate reality. The goal of the course is to reflect on the fantastical or derealizing impulse in literary narrative, from ancient myth, the folk tale and medieval romance to the revival of the fantastical in nineteenth-century romanticism and early realism, before moving finally to three 20th-century novels from Russia, Cuba and India, whose “magical realism” can be read as arising out of the productive collision between the pressures of modern history and the archaic legacies of myth and oral storytelling.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17356

L. KurkeAlso listed as Classics 211The seminar will be devoted to consideration of archaic Greek choral poetry as embedded in its ritual and religious contexts (focusing mainly on Pindar’s epinikia, but possibly also including some compositions of Alkman, Simonides, and Bacchylides).  My starting point is the reflection that monodic lyric (e.g., Sappho, Alkaios, Anakreon), although it does not really conform to post-Romantic models of the privacy and subjectivity of lyric voice, is still much more accessible to a style of reading informed by post-Romantic assumptions.  Archaic choral lyric, in contrast, is often difficult, obscure, and inaccessible not just because it is fragmentary, but also because it is so deeply enmeshed in (partially or entirely lost) contexts of religious occasion and ritual action.  I would therefore like to approach the reading of epinikion by trying, insofar as it is possible, to reconstruct the ritual surround and re-embed therein the bare texts we possess.  This will entail simultaneous reading of other kinds of sources (e.g., epigraphic, later prose) to try to develop a “thick description” of archaic choral performance contexts. We will start with several weeks reading Plato’s Laws Books 1-3 and 7, and then move to choral lyric poetry.  Possibly some work on “Pindar and the Monuments,” setting individual poems or clusters of poems in their local religious/ritual /topographic contexts (e.g., P.4, P.5, P.9 in Kyrene; Pindar fr. 94b, P.11, I.1, I.3/4, I.7 in Thebes; Aeginetan Odes).  Course Catalog Number: 17398

R. AlterThis course is conceived as an advanced workshop in literary translation, founded on the assumption that the practice of translation is fundamental to the study of literature. Each student should have a semester-long translation project (a collection of poems or stories, part of a novel, a long poem, a memoir, etc.). There are no restrictions as to languages translated or periods from which the texts are taken. Each week the class will discuss samples from two of these projects in progress. The seminar sessions are intended to be collaborative discussions on the problems of literary translation rather than critiques of the work of the translators. We will not be reading translation theory.Course Catalog Number: 17407

F. MasielloThis course is also listed as Span 280:2This course is designed to question the conventional critical categories with which we have learned to speak about literature at the close of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth. Instead of reinforcing the oft-stated divisions between naturalism and aestheticism, we will look at the corpus of fin de siglo writing through a different lens in order to probe certain issues that broadly define culture of the times: hence, the ways in which different aesthetic proposals negotiate the transformation of Latin America and Europe from a rural to urban society, and the representation of the body, illness, and criminality as markers of a society in transition. Along with this, we will look at the kinds of literary languages produced in fin de siglo texts in order to produce a disruption of traditional modes of representation, emphasizing performance or masquerade as rituals of modernization. Finally, we will consider the polemics triggered by cultural modernization, including the professionalization of the writer, the marketing of literary phenomena, the “fashion” of aesthetics and literature destined for a leisure class audience, and the creation of an intellectual bohemia as a counter-public sphere. Texts will be drawn from the literatures of the Southern Cone, the Caribbean, and Peru along with several texts from the British and French traditions.This course will be continued in the following year with emphasis on literature at the close of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, but it is not required that you continue; nor will students interested in recent culture be required to take this course as prerequisite for admission to the next one.You need to be fluent in Spanish in order to take this course.  Course Catalog Number:

Marianne Kaletzky and Emily LaskinFandom gets a bad name in the academic world. Literary scholars pride themselves on their analytical approach to, and critical distance from, works already recognized as high art. Fans, on the other hand, throw themselves into the least esteemed genres and forms.Yet scholarship can’t entirely shake its ties to fandom. The history of the Western novel begins with a fan, Don Quixote, who devotes his life to the seventeenth-century equivalent of a Star Trek convention: dressing up as a character from the stories he loves. Many texts beloved by scholars have their origins in fandom, with authors so fascinated by their predecessors that they reinterpret their work. And literary criticism, no matter how objective it may seem, always depends on a reader’s often emotional, sometimes fanatical attachment to a text. So what’s the difference between a work of fan fiction and an artistic reinterpretation? And where’s the boundary between a fan and a critic?This course will explore fandom as both a literary theme and a literary habit. Some texts we’ll read are populated by obsessive fans who can’t stop referencing their favorite works; other texts are themselves obsessive fans who can’t stop referencing their favorite works. The majority of our readings fall into both categories.Since this is an R&C course, we’ll devote most of our time to close reading and intensive writing. The course will develop students’ abilities to read texts carefully, to examine both points of coherence and moments of tension within them, and to analyze the relationship between meaning and textual form. Its other major aim is to help students express increasingly complex ideas in writing. The various writing activities in the class, from the major analytical essays to shorter creative exercises, will connect critical thinking and writing, improve students’ control over their writing voice, and introduce new ways of thinking about structure and development.Required books:

Ashley BrockWhat family isn’t steeped in lore, haunted by skeletons in the closet, or delighted by its own humorous anecdotes no matter how many times they’ve been told? In this class we will explore the singular relationship between the family and story telling. What does it mean to understand family identity as a form of narrative? How does family identity intersect with individual identity, cultural identity, and national identity?  To what extent do the stories that are passed down through our families shape who we are and determine what kind of a world we inherit? What is the importance of unearthing, reconstructing, telling, and re-telling the stories of how our families came to be?These are some of the questions we will address while examining texts from a wide range of time periods and cultural traditions. In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument. To this end, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling argumentative paper.Texts may include the work of: Sophocles, William Shakespeare, Clarice Lispector, William Faulkner, Gayl Jones, Marjane Satrapi, Sherman Alexie, Tillie Olsen, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and David Chase.  Course Catalog Number: 17209

South and North America share a similar history of conquest, slavery, nation-building, and migration. The works and authors we will read in this course help us think about the ways this history is transmitted, codified and remembered. They ask us, as readers of these texts, to reexamine the history we think we know. Storytelling in the Americas thus acts as a means of rewriting history, thereby opening up the spaces for previously unheard voices to appear and exist.This course will revolve around the following questions:  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17221

We’ll look at the literary representation of various sites of schooling across multiple continents and centuries, from the governess-run nursery to the urban public school, from the boarding school to the world beyond its walls, and we’ll ask what can be learned and taught within these spaces, and also why some texts might make us skeptical about them.   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17224

Andrea Gadberry“Elegy,” the Romantic poet and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge remarked, “is the form of poetry natural to the reflective mind. It may treat of any subject, but it must treat of no subject for itself; but always and exclusively with reference to the poet himself. As he will feel regret for the past or desire for the future, so sorrow and love become the principle themes of elegy. Elegy presents every thing as lost and gone, or absent and future.” This semester, we will put Coleridge’s definition to the test as we study elegiac poems as well as other literary forms preoccupied with what happens when “every thing” might seem to be “lost and gone.”As we read across genres and national traditions, we will ask how works of art grapple with burial and mourning, how they commemorate the dead – or, sometimes, bring them back to life. Our inquiry will begin with the careful study of elegiac poems from several traditions, but we will also be interested in how other genres (novel, play, speech, film, essay) develop elegiac idioms of their own. How do these (often highly self-conscious) works deal with the question of a self that has lost an essential attachment? How do these texts construct identities for their speakers and narrators; in what ways, for instance, are expressions of sorrow and melancholy gendered or culturally coded? How might works about personal loss intersect with broader communities (the family, the state) or address their readers? How do poems of loss portray and interact with place? What is the relationship between grief and time: what are the temporalities of loss, how are they conveyed in form, and what is this “absent and future” space Coleridge imagines?Books:

Oya Erez “I don’t know which of us has written this page.”
-Jorge Luis Borges, “Borges and I”Artists’ personas, alter egos, doppelgängers, shadows and evil twins are some of the literary doubles we encounter in this course. Our characters will turn out to be obsessed with mirrors, echoes, not getting old, cheating death, figuring out if they are real or fake, better or worse, and – not surprisingly – with their doubles. As we go from Babylonia in 2000 B.C. to Los Angeles in the new millennium, we will see that these kinds of relationships have been an ongoing subject of fascination for writers and filmmakers. We will try to understand what it is about being around someone so much like oneself that can bring out both the most profound and the most disturbing elements in one’s character. We will also ask what these relationships can tell us about the relationship between writer and reader, filmmaker and viewer, narrator and subject.This is a writing-intensive course that builds on the skills you have gained in the first of the Reading and Composition sequence. In this course, you will use your critical reflections on the text as starting point for developing two papers, the latter of which will incorporate research on literary criticism. You will develop your papers through the course of the semester by means of a series of brainstorming assignments, draft outlines, in-class workshops, peer edits and revisions. In addition to the two longer papers, you will also complete shorter weekly reading responses and additional assignments devoted to specific elements of essay writing.WorksThe Epic of Gilgamesh

Brian Clancy & Keith FordThis course focuses on the impression as a unique mode of visual, philosophical, and literary experience. When people hear the word “impression” in the context of the history of art, they often think of the French Impressionists of the late-19th century. But the notion of the impression as a mode of perception has a much broader intellectual history, and it will be the goal of this course to present students with a grasp of its dynamic history, as well as its theoretical scope in an interdisciplinary sense.   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17233

Johnathan Vaknin & Howard FisherIn this course, we will look at the ways in which law and literature converge, diverge, and inform one another directly or indirectly. From Sophocles’s Antigone to Melville’s Billy Budd, and from Kafka’s The Trial to Puig’s Kiss of the Spider Woman, our readings will be guided by the following questions, among others: How might we think of social norms both in terms of culture and the law, and what is the function of each in the construction of these norms? How do certain texts represent positions outside of the law? Is there an “outside” to the law? What shared formal and stylistic elements might we identify between legal texts and cultural texts? (Think, for example, of the importance of testimony and narration). While most of our readings will be literary, in the final segment of the semester we will shift our attention to films as well as to specific legal documents.The second in the University’s two-part R&C sequence, this class is meant, above all, to help students improve their critical writing, reading, and research skills.

Noa Bar Hannah Arendt describes the modern political revolution as a kind of narrative, as an attempt to write “an entirely new story, a story never known or told before.” However, Arendt goes on to question the accepted notion that the “plot” of the modern revolution necessarily culminates in the creation of an entirely new order which establishes a foundation for equality and self-governance.In this course, we will follow both the connection Arendt makes between political revolution and literary narrative and heed her insight that revolution may not lead to unprecedented political freedom.  Looking at a variety of textual forms (novel, short story, graphic novel, film), including the work of Marjane Satrapi (Iran, Austria), Assia Djebar (Algeria) we will explore the following questions and tensions involved in revoution: How does the personal affect the political and vice-versa?  How can practices of everyday life become resistance (Satrapi, DeCerteau) What happens when a movement of national liberation from colonial rule nonetheless leaves gender inequality in place (Djebar)  How can modes of representation of political causes either open up or foreclose possibilities of rupture with old orders?Just as revolution is an attempt to revise history, we will focus on our own process of revision as writers.  We will write multiple drafts for all assignments, which will be reviewed both by the instructor and by peers.  We will have a series of writing workshops throughout the semester which will present the writing process in concrete steps—from the simple act of making observations about a text, to techniques of close reading, and finally to constructing arguments.Reading List:Hannah Arendt, On Revolution (excerpts)

The influence of The 1001 Nights on Western literature has been so widespread that, outside of the Bible, it has no rival from the literature of the Near in the world literary imagination. Jorge Luis Borges once said that the Nights, “is a book so vast that it is not necessary to have read it.” Yet, only by reading the original Arabic story collection of the Nights, taken from Indian and Persian sources, can we reach an understanding of how this story collection has come to play such a decisive role in both Arab and Western cultural spheres since the eighteenth century. This class will examine the core stories of the Nights based on Medieval Arabic manuscripts and the history of the Nights’ translation, reception, and large-scale appropriation by the West from the eighteenth century onward. We will look at the Nights’ narrative structure, often a source of innovation for later authors, while simultaneously examining how the stories have often served to reinforce colonial and neocolonial projects. We will likewise consider how the figure of the Nights’ famous storyteller, Shahrazad, has paradoxically been the subject of appropriation by both Western Orientalists and Arab feminists. We will work across different media and genres, with texts, images, theater, and film, to understand the Nights and its influence in the most far reaching sense. Texts will include the translation of Muhsin Mahdi’s edited fourteenth century Syrian manuscript, excerpts from Edward Lane’s and Richard Burton’s translations, and both Eastern and Western works fundamentally influenced by the Nights, among them: Edgar Allen Poe, Salman Rushdie, Jorge Luis Borges, Naguib Mahfouz, and Voltaire.Course Catalog Number: 17290

Professor Sharon Aronson-Lehavi In this course we will discuss dramatic works by Jewish and Israeli playwrights, authors, and performance artists, in which relations between gender, religion, and cultural identity are explored. By engaging with performance theory we shall discuss topics such as gender and ethnicity, feminism and religion, identity politics in historical and contemporary contexts, and performance as a vehicle for exploring self-identity. In order to discuss plays which conflate gender and questions of modern Jewish identity, the course will contextualize the plays with various modes of representation, examining the relations between the dramatic styles which are employed and at times invented by the authors and the social questions that are negotiated through the plays. These modes of representation include realistic drama (and the critique of realism); documentary drama; epic and Brechtian drama; Écriture féminine; solo performance, and performance-art. Classes will be accompanied by DVD recordings of many of the plays we discuss. All readings are in English.Course Catalog Number: 17305

Perhaps the three most influential experimental or avant-gardist groupings within the period of American poetry beginning just after 1945 are the Beats, the New York School, and the poets of–and associated with–the educational and arts experiment known as Black Mountain College.  Located in a collection of church buildings in Black Mountain, North Carolina, the College actually began (in 1933) well before “Beat” or “New York School” poetry came into being.    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17314

Professor Barbara SpackmanAs a literary movement, “Decadence” came into existence by means of an act of cultural re-signification; taking up an epithet meant as an insult, Anatole Baju transformed “decadence” into a rallying cry.  This course will mime this inaugural gesture by grouping together a number of fin-de-siècle (for the most part) writers and intellectuals (including Freud and the sexologists) whose works are, we will suggest, the locus of a series of cultural re-significations.  In particular, we will look at the ways in which norms constraining and defining genders, sexualities, and literary, political, and aesthetic practices are tested and transformed in works by Charles Baudelaire, J.K. Huysmans, Georges Rodenbach, Octave Mirbeau, Leopold von Sacher Masoch, Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater, Havelock Ellis, Gabriele D’Annunzio, Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer, and Rachilde.

Professor Harsha RamThe role of national literatures in consolidating the cultural heritage of modern nations is indisputable. National literary histories organize and collate a remote, often premodern past, even as they consolidate linguistic standards and canonize new generic forms: in this sense they are essential for articulating the linguistic and aesthetic dimensions of the relationship between “tradition” and “modernity.”   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17347

His seminar will explore the ways in which race has served as the ordinary radioactive core of American history, continually warping the potential for ordinary class-based politics and accounting for all manner of perverse American exceptionalism.The first session of the course will focus on the work of installation and assemblage artist Edward Kienholz and his viscerally charged 1968-1970 response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the lynchings that preceded it. The next three sessions will follow Kienholz’s work successively through American history to consider a series of key moments, spanning from Bacon’s Rebellion and the Revolutionary War, through the end of Reconstruction, to the Civil Rights movement and the subsequent rise and dominance of a white racist party. Course Catalog Number: 17350

Jeffrey WeinerA survey of “fantasy literature” and some of the literary, philosophical, and psychological issues attached to it. Beginning with Near Eastern and Hellenistic creation myths, we will then move on to the Byzantine and Roman novels. The course will cover fairy tales, medieval allegory and chivalric tales, Renaissance romance, and culminate in more recent syntheses of these traditions. We will consider how these tales comment on morality, the family, cultural history, and ideology. How do these tales tap into a “collective unconsciousness,” urge reform, provide escape, and encourage cultural creativity? The course is writing and reading intensive, and students will be expected to develop research and writing skills.Texts:Bible, Selections from the Book of Genesis.

Philip Gerard“The power of debt is described as if it were exercised neither through repression nor through ideology. The debtor is “free,” but his actions, his behavior, are confined to the limits defined by the debt he has entered into.”– Maurizio Lazzarato, The Making of Indebted ManDebt is a way of life. In California, 50% of college seniors who graduated from non-profit institutions last year left school with some form of student debt. From this pool, the average obligation comes out to $20,250. As any 19th century novelist could tell you, this is an auspicious way to begin a story.In this Reading and Composition course we will pursue the topic of debt beyond the bounds of economics. From social obligations to moral duty, from financial lending to literary borrowing, we will examine the meaning(s) and genesis of debt as a concept and a metaphor. As we go over our own set of books, drawing on a series of artistic, anthropological and philosophical treatments of debt from a range of historical periods, we will refine our critical reading skills and study the art of making and defending an argument.As we explore the sorts of obligations that bind us, we will also be studying the craft of writing and revising an analytical paper. Students can expect to write and revise two papers, give an in-class presentation, and complete several smaller assignments.Books

Ashley BrockWhen is the last time you heard a classmate or reviewer celebrate the “relatability” of a work of literature or film? This term has become so prevalent that New Yorker writer Rebecca Mead has recently decried the “scourge of relatability” that has come to afflict contemporary culture. But what does it mean to be “relatable”? Why is this something we look for in a work of art? What, if anything, is wrong with expecting or seeking out “relatability”? Is this a new phenomenon or an age-old one?In this class we will examine texts from a range of time periods and cultural traditions in attempts to elucidate how the contemporary use of “relatable,” meaning inviting identification, might relate to the word’s original meaning, which was closer to “tellable,” or capable of being related in narrative. Does a text that bars us from identifying with it through difficult form or unlikeable characters necessarily jeopardize its ability to tell a tale? Why might some tales resist being relatable in either sense? How might a text’s refusal of “relatability” help us to recognize and respect cultural difference, to question our right to know another’s story, or to appreciate indirect or non-narrative ways in which deeply personal or traumatic experiences might be transmitted?In fulfillment of the Reading and Composition requirement, this class aims to improve the students’ abilities to think rigorously and write clearly about subjects of intellectual complexity in order to prepare them for the demands of college-level coursework. Significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to close read a literary text, articulate an interpretive argument, and write a clear and compelling analytical paper.Required Texts:William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of King Lear

Margarita GordonWe tend to view fact and fiction as polar opposites, opposites that shape our concept of knowledge, truth, and morality. Yet when we speak of “actual fact” in contrast to “mere fiction,” we often take for granted or simply ignore the basis for differentiating them from one another. In this course, we will endeavor to define the precepts—cultural, philosophical, and psychological—that govern this distinction. More radically, we will ask to what extent the distinction holds up.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17221

Brian ClancyThe purpose of this course is to improve your ability to write clearly, effectively, and accurately about literary subjects. The course works under the assumption that critical writing–and the kinds of thinking that lead to such writing–are a necessity for college students. The ability to write critically also represents a very significant step in one’s intellectual development more generally. The focus of this class will be on practicing the fundamental skills of writing and reading, both in class and out of class. Our topic as we do so will be totality.Totalities (whether literary, social, or political) are rarely fixed entities. Totality entails both thinking about the world according to a wider scope, but also placing particular phenomena in relation to this broader whole. Our aim in this course is to consider the diverse ways in which totalities arise, with a special focus on literature. Thinking about totality enhances our understanding of how literary works present their readers with encompassing structures and relations. It shows us how the mind collects groups of phenomena and attempts to contain them through varying degrees of closure or more elastic rubrics. Totalities often group things through resemblance to other systems of consolidation.When the concept of totality appears in literature, it signifies images of the whole, as well as new relations between the whole and its parts. Here totalities are literary constructions and they are fabricated or delimited for different purposes. Totalities rarely exist in isolation, instead, they overlap, as is so often the case with competing notions of social totality.Totality is a fecund concept. It can explain a language system. It can be a way to conceive of a human body and the trajectories of movement it makes. Totality even arises in everyday contexts through spatial movements which take place when urban dwellers engage in leisurely walks. Instead of thinking about totality as unlimited or ambiguous, we will examine it in terms of specific themes: movement and mobility, time, perception, and fluctuation. That said, we will primarily focus on this concept in terms of literary genre, the set of criteria which helps us to define different types of literary expression.Writing literary works (and academic essays) involves rules which apply to the whole. The dynamic notion of literary totality will help us to explain developments and fluctuations in the rules for a genre like the novel. At the course’s inception, we will see how in Aristotle’s Poetics, totality involves a theory of genre for the forms of literature called tragedy and epic, while also stressing the value of a coherent plot with proper magnitude. We will then see how notions of totality are at the heart of Miguel de Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote. In Cervantes’ we will consider the emergence of the novel genre, seeing how overlapping and emergent notions of totality shed light on the question of literary world-formation.Later, focusing on a period in the early 20th-century known as modernism, we will see how through diverse literary experiments the rules of the novel can be rewritten. For example, we will look at how in Ulysses, James Joyce reconceived of the novel as a new type of literary whole. Totality also involves questions of time. Here we will see how modernist works like those of Joyce and Virginia Woolf approach the concept of totality through a literary interpretation of the idea of infinity.Our notion of totality also extends beyond genre and time. Joyce’s Dublin and Woolf’s London, respectively, re-imagine urban space. We can thus create mental shapes of totalities through a complex “cognitive mapping” (Fredric Jameson’s term) that reconstructs urban space in terms of part and whole. Here we will turn to the French philosopher Michel de Certeau’s The Practice of Everyday Life and his notionof “the itinerary.” For de Certeau, walking in the city creates different modes of an idea called “synecdoche” (the replacement of part for whole). Buttressed by brief selections from the work of the 18th-century British Empiricist David Hume, we will examine how the mind forms an idea of spatial totality on the basis of the impressions of objects. We wish to see how our impressions and ideas of space cohere (or fail to cohere) into stable images of totality or reliable narratives.In examining these pressing issues, we will perform a significant amount of detailed analysis of various literary texts as well as analytic writing. We will learn how to perform sophisticated close-readings of passages from the assigned texts. Special focus will be placed on identifying and examining different literary techniques that authors employ as well as the effects of these literary techniques. We then plan to develop these dynamic interpretative skills in conjunction with learning how to formulate arguments and write well-structured papers. Ultimately the goal of the course is to learn how to write a superb academic essay, and to think in more clear, specific, and effective ways about literature and the arts in general.Texts:Aristotle, The Poetics

Keith Ford Paul De Morais“It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet,
there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.”
—Bilbo BagginsBefore we even set out on a journey, the places we go are invested with meaning and, often, idealized goals. Inevitably, there is a dissonance between destination and dream. Perhaps accounting for this, in literature, many travelers are bound to entirely fictitious destinations. And yet, the fiction is as revealing as any fact when considering why we are driven to travel. What values and expectations does the traveler carry with him, perhaps unwittingly? How are indigenous populations represented? What are the social and political motivations for both travel texts and utopian texts? In order to investigate these and other questions, this course will engage with texts both factual and fictional such as Plato’s Timaeus and selections from Republic, Lucian’s Trips to the Moon, Virgil’s Eclogues, Thomas More’s Utopia, de Bergerac’s Voyage to the Moon, selections from Thevet’s Singularities of Antarctic France and Lery’s True Voyage to Brazil and from Montaigne’s Essays, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Aimé Césaire’s “A Tempest,” selections from Gulliver’s Travels (the Liliputians and the Houyhnhnms), Bernardin de Saint Pierre’s Paul & Virginia, John Clare’s poem “The Lamentations of Round-Oak Waters”, Alexander Pope’s “A Discourse on Pastoral Poetry,” Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Addison, Spectator #11 & 414, and selections from Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.This is a reading and writing intensive course with several essay assignments which will build upon the skills acquired in R1A. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying while entering the world of literary criticism and learning to integrate and interrogate criticism in their own writing.Course Catalog Number: 17233

This course approaches the question by addressing one conventional dimension of literary works: genre. Rather than tracing a single literary genre through its formation, development, and dissolution, this course considers several genres (the family tragedy, the gothic novel, the noir film) side by side to get at whether one can distinguish how they are generic. Is it the case that works of the same genre are necessarily concerned with the same subject matter? Do they share a typical structure? A certain look? A set of techniques for making meaning? Convey a special feeling?By juxtaposing canonical works of a genre with particular permutations of it, we will explore how texts produce meaning not only semantically (through a series of grammatical statements), but also indexically by evocatively pointing to other works. Juxtaposing works of different genres also gives students the opportunity to question how genres overlap, drawing on and responding to not only works of the same genre, but also a broader archive of texts. The opportunity to think about genres in relation to each other leads into thinking about them in relation to literary modes such as realism. Ultimately students will have to decide for themselves what status to give the term genre: Is it constitutive of texts – part of how works conceive of themselves and produce meaning? Is it a product of the juxtapositions that we as readers construct – by, for instance, putting works together on a syllabus)? Is it an effect of markets – the fact that readers’ expectations influence authors’ writing and that texts are marketed in ways that readers will recognize? If so, what gives some works the power to define a genre?Focusing on literature, film, and criticism, this course will explore these questions as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. With these goals in mind, members of this course will be asked to illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, periodic posts to a bcourses forum, and consistent in-class participation.Required texts:Henry James, The Turn of the Screw

But as a key technique of literary experimentation and innovation, point of view becomes something radically unfamiliar. In this course we will engage a variety of literary traditions in order to study — and develop our own arguments about — how authors structure point of view differently.

While literature classes often touch on the relationship between the artist and his or her literary work of art, this class will focus especially on how artists reflect upon themselves as artists through their art. What happens when the subject of a literary work becomes the artist him or herself?   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17209

																	Tales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? How do competing twentieth-century empires (such as those in Japan, China, and Britain) conceive of themselves — and of one another — differently? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17212

																	In this course, we will look at the relationship between architecture and literature primarily through two different prepositions: first, in literature, as in the presence of the built environment, such as houses, buildings, roads, etc., in many different texts; second, of literature, as in the different structural forms of a variety of genres. What is the shape or space of the novel? How is a poem built—and how does it construct meaning? Naturally, we will also consider the two—in and of—together and examine ways in which they influence each other; how, for example, different forms of architecture have impacted different generic practices, and vice versa. Our readings take us from ancient Greece through the Paris of the 19th and 20th Century, from Virginia Woolf’s London to J.G. Ballard’s High-Rise. As this is an R1B class, writing is an essential component. In weekly workshops, students will have the opportunity to work on idea development, argumentative skills, and revision in smaller formats, with the semester’s efforts culminating in a 10-page research paper and its subsequent revision.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17233

																	The topic of obsession, primarily in the context of [romantic] love, is extremely prevalent in literature, film, and popular culture. Authors and artists of various modes, genres, and historical periods often utilize the idea of obsession in order to produce works that are both aesthetically affective and, in some senses, universally interesting and relatable. In this class, we will be engaging with texts that grapple with the complexities of obsession, from “ordinary” unrequited love to murderous jealousy and rage. What is the relationship between obsessive love and artistic creation? What is it about the topic of obsession that allows an interesting and engaging narrative to unfold? This class will explore these and similar questions, drawing on works by (among others) Nabokov, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, and Alfred Hitchcock.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17257

																	Once considered primarily a form of education and/ or propaganda, the documentary film is enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the 21st century as a form of entertainment and art. In an age crazed with reality television and celebrity biographies, the documentary genre throws into relief a number of questions that have long animated literature, photography, and film: What does it mean to show a life “as it really is”, to tell a story “as it really happened”? How can authenticity be measured and proven, and what responsibility does a storyteller have to do so? What are the ethical demands and pitfalls of telling someone else’s story, and how are these related to the fraught quests for objectivity, authenticity, and fidelity to “the truth”? Where does the line between art and document lie?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17260

But the fact is that the only “we” we know—ourselves and the people close to us—are born into the state; and our forebears too were born into the state as far back as we can trace. The state is always there before we are. . . . Those who chose and choose to stay outside the compact become outlaw.” –J.M.

																	Some say that the TV series has recently supplanted the novel as America’s great art form, echoing the critic Brett Martin’s claim that the TV series has become, “the signature American art form of the first decade of the 21st century” in his book Difficult Men. But this idea of a series or sequential work of art can be traced back much earlier than the 21st century. This class will examine the idea of the series and the broader concept of seriality from a wide range of national cultures and genres (poetry, prose, radio, TV, as well as visual works of art and graphic novels) in an attempt to better understand and analyze this popular art form.  How do we analyze a serial work of art?  What challenges and questions does a longer sequence bring to the practice of close reading and analysis?  How does our approach to reading a series change from genre to genre?  How do authors use anticipation to construct their narratives?    »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17266

																	If, as Judith Butler suggests, “to desire is to err, but to err necessarily,” how can we tell when desire is a necessary, productive deviation from the norm, and when it becomes a dangerous, counter-productive force? In this course, we will explore the uneasy relationship between desire and the “erring” away from, or transgression of national, social, cultural, and sexual boundaries. How do we distinguish between “healthy” or “normal” desire and “deviant” or “abnormal” desire? Is it possible to err too far if we desire too strongly? In what ways does desire dictate the formation of the boundaries of one’s own self?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17269

																	If one accepts that all language is conventional, how do authors continually manage to produce literary works that have the power to charm and surprise us? This course approaches the question by addressing one conventional dimension of literary works: genre. Rather than tracing a single literary genre through its formation, development, and dissolution, this course considers several genres (the family tragedy, the gothic novel, the noir film) side by side to get at whether one can distinguish how they are generic. Is it the case that works of the same genre are necessarily concerned with the same subject matter? Do they share a typical structure? A certain look? A set of techniques for making meaning? Convey a special feeling?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17275

								This course will consider the contemporary and queer fate of three Greek tragedies, Sophocles’ Oedipus, the King and Antigone, and Euripides’, The Bacchae. In our readings, we will pay attention to how “tragic” consequences take place when the actions of characters deviate from kinship norms or when kinship relations are not recognized. We will consider as well how queer rewritings of tragic scenes seek to generate alternative ways of thinking about non-normative kinship.  Are all forms of non-normative kinship tragic? What are the conditions under which we come to recognize new forms of kinship that do not lead only to tragic consequences?  The course will pair Greek tragedies with writings, films, and plays by James Baldwin, Colm Toibin, James Baldwin, Tony Kushner, Alison Bechdel, Monique Wittig, and Octavia Butler, among others. We will also read some theoretical essays on tragedy and queer kinship, including texts from anthropology, feminist philosophy and psychoanalysis, and consider contemporary films that replay – and rework – key themes of tragic kinship and queer life.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17323

								How, in our recent past and contemporary moment, might a groundbreaking body of poetry—radically innovative in form and content, with great international resonance, and widely perceived to have “gone for broke,” as Theodor W. Adorno famously put it—find its poetics taken up by poets and others artists of different languages, cultures, and sociopolitical situations? This seminar will consider a telling episode in the history of that emphatically comparatist question.  We’ll spend approximately the first half of the semester reading the German-language poet Paul Celan (1920-1970); in the latter part of the semester, we’ll read poetry from across the Americas that responds to Celan’s work, or that has been received in dialogue with it.  More of our American-poetry readings will come from the United States than any other individual country in the hemisphere; but we’ll also be reading a good deal of poetry from the Caribbean (French, Spanish, and English-speaking); from México, Argentina, and Chile; and from both English-speaking Canada and Québec.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17353

In addition, we will discuss some seminal critical work on the cultural dynamics of manuscripts. After this introductory part, our class will explore selected cases and genres such as medieval bibles, books of hours, poetic anthologies, and manuscripts with scientific texts. In the third part of the course, students will pursue their own research in collaboration with the instructors.Course Catalog Number: 17356

								In his recent Antinomies of Realism, Frederic Jameson identifies an unresolvable tension in the realist novel between two impulses. One is familiar enough: it goes under the banner of récit, the tale, the story, or simply “narrative.” It’s characterized by a movement of progress and a temporality organized by past-present-future. The other impulse, which Jameson curiously calls “affect,” is everything that impedes this narrative movement. In his analysis this affective impulse is characterized by a dilatory, perpetual presentness, and its growing dominance in the later 19th century leads to the dissolution of realism into modernism.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 17358

How is the body a site on which questions of political and social power are negotiated in relation to the archaic and the primitive? How do bodies suffer and inflict violence within these constructions of power? How are bodies racialized and sexualized in relation to the classical and the savage?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 13927

Contemporary popular culture celebrates the home as a refuge from the world, finding in its separation from public life and association with the nuclear family the promise of a nurturing, comfortable space where we can simply be ourselves. Yet literature and film are replete with another sort of home: isolated but never totally private, familiar but never completely safe.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 13934

Oscar, the rational man of science, is quick to identify the source of José’s problem: his constant “prowl for new sensations.” In response, Fernández adamantly declares that all he desires is to “live life! To get drunk on it.” This course asks what it means to “get drunk on life” through the pursuit of sensual pleasure.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 13938

Celine PiserTales of San Francisco
This summer, we’ll focus on the city across the bay. San Francisco is known for its diversity and unique character. It is not surprising to find the city featured throughout popular culture—in films, TV shows, literature, music, and even video games. We will take a look at all these media to determine what kind of character San Francisco has come to represent in the past century and why. We’ll compare images of San Francisco as native home and adopted home; we’ll look at the diverse subcultures that have called it home during the twentieth century; we’ll compare its fictional image with the San Francisco we know today. We will also, of course, look at the people that make the city, and focus, in particular, on the languages and voices that share the space. We will ask ourselves if these disparate voices can come together to represent one city, or if they remain discrete, personal representations.We will begin with a look at San Francisco’s famous detective literature, and at a few of its international stylistic precursors and heirs. We’ll read an excerpt of Voltaire’s Zadig before studying a portrait of San Francisco’s dark side in Dashiell Hammett’s 1930 novel The Maltese Falcon, and its 1941 film adaptation by John Huston. We’ll also look at Daniel Pennac’s treatment of the Parisian detective in The Fairy Gunmother, and question his representations of the multiethnic neighborhood of Belleville.Next, we’ll look at San Francisco as a hub of immigration, multiculturalism, and multilingualism. We’ll read Jade Snow Wong’s representation of Chinese American immigrants in San Francisco in Fifth Chinese Daughter and a collection of short stories by Latino writers in San Francisco. We’ll also read some travel narratives and travel-inspired poetry by early visitors to San Francisco, such as Rudyard Kipling, to get an idea of how the city has developed over the past few centuries.Finally, we will examine how San Francisco has become a home to alternative lifestyles. We’ll study the Beat Generation, the San Francisco Renaissance and the Japanese poetry traditions that influenced the movement. In Tales of the City, Armistead Maupin writes about sexuality in 1970s San Francisco. We’ll compare his portrait to Gus Van Sant’s film about Harvey Milk, the US’s first openly gay politician, SF city supervisor and self-titled “Mayor of Castro Street.” If we have time, we’ll take a field trip across the bay to see the mythic city in person, and perhaps attend the theatrical production of Maupin’s novel.Our work on fiction, nonfiction, poetry and film will be supplemented by critical readings from literary theory, sociology and linguistics. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, and analytical and research papers.

Karina PalauSe vê que ainda não sei viajar. . .
(It’s clear that I still don’t know how to travel. . .)
–Mário de Andrade, O turista aprendiz (The Apprentice Tourist)What does it mean to travel? How does the experience of ‘taking a trip’ shape how we see ourselves and our culture, especially in relationship to what we encounter outside of the place we consider ‘home’? If, as Brazilian writer Mário de Andrade implies, travel is something we learn, not just do, how are we taught to travel and why?In this course, we will take these questions as a point of departure for our own journey through a rich set of materials that portray different experiences in travel.  In our wanderings from descriptions of homecomings to touristy vacations, from journeys of ‘discovery’ to ethnographic missions, we will try to unpack the tensions inherent in questions of ‘here vs. there,’ ‘self vs. other,’ and the dynamics of cultural encounter.Possible Readings and Viewings: Excerpts from Christopher Columbus’ Diario“The Smallest Woman in the World,” Clarice Lispector“The Ethnographer,” Jorge Luis BorgesExcepts from Lose Your Mother, Saidiya HartmanPoems by Etheridge Knight and Walt Whitman (“The Meaning of Ancestry,” “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry”)The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara KingsolverThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot DíazBabel, Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu or Darjeeling Limited, Directed by Wes AndersonShort selections from James Clifford’s Writing Culture and Routes, Mary Pratt’s Imperial Eyes, and works by Roland Barthes and Levi-StraussCourse Catalog Number:

Andrea GadberryThis course has two major aims.  First, it will attempt to consider how the novel can work as an ambivalent form or as a form that induces ambivalence.  Second, it will explore the concept of ambivalence more widely through texts whose narrators, characters, and plots engage in the anxiety and melancholia of ambivalence.Our study of the novel will take particular interest in ambivalence’s formal properties both in the subject who experiences ambivalence and in texts that seem to evoke this subjective state through narrative.  As we read these novels, we’ll also look at literary criticism, psychoanalytic works, and philosophical texts and attempt to understand the production of some of ambivalence’s kin: ambiguity, irony, and paradox.  We’ll examine the structure of ambivalent desire and its relationship to the fetish in novels that portray love-hate relationships, sadomasochism, and repressed (contradictory) desires.  Likewise, we’ll read works that help us probe the states that follow ambivalence from resolution and resignation to the “madness of the decision.”  As we ponder the fraught relationship of ambivalence to action, we’ll ask, adapting Simone de Beauvoir’s  terminology, how these novels offer or refuse an “ethics of ambi[valence].”Major assignments may include two papers, several shorter assignments, and one presentation.Required Texts:Djuna Barnes. Nightwood.Denis Diderot. Jacques the Fatalist.Henry James. What Maisie Knew.Thomas Mann. Death in Venice.Vladimir Nabokov. King, Queen, Knave.François Rabelais. Le tiers livre.Robert Louis Stevenson.

Tristram WolffHow do the aims of marriage control the plot of a comedy, and how can comic innovation rewrite the rituals of marriage and divorce? Taking its guiding motives from Stanley Cavell’s study of the 1940s Hollywood screwball comedy (Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage, 1981), this course is an effort to follow through on some of the work’s evasions and loose ends. We’ll do this by considering three distinct forms of comedy (Shakespeare’s plays, classic screwball films, and more briefly Austen’s novels), and by introducing some contemporary deviations from the conventional marriage plot. As a constitutive element of comedy, as well as a critical risk from the Adam and Eve story to the recent rash of reality TV dating shows, the “plot” to perform, consummate or re-enact a marriage represents for narrative both capstone and pitfall. In this course, we will pose questions about the promising “conversational” basis of remarriage, the self-reflective artifice of the genre’s classics, and the manner in which these texts embody, comment on or inflect their social conditions. We will also test the limits of the genre by zeroing in on outdated gender roles and the “threat” of gay marriage. Above all, we will practice reading literary and cinematic texts to question and expand Cavell’s suggestions about the interaction between artistic media, social norms and comic subversion.Texts & FilmsWilliam Shakespeare:• A Midsummer Night’s Dream• Much Ado About Nothing • As You Like It • The Winter’s TaleJane Austen:• Emma (selections)• PersuasionStanley Cavell, Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage•  The Lady Eve (Preston Sturges)• The Palm Beach Story (Preston Sturges)• Bringing Up Baby (Leo McCarey)• The Awful Truth (Leo McCarey)• The Philadelphia Story (George Cukor)• His Girl Friday (Howard Hawks)Additional primary and secondary reading on comedy, marriage and film will likely include selections from the Bible, Milton, Henri Bergson, Johan Huizinga, C.

Session A: 5/23-7/1Contemporary American Genres, Contemporary American Identities Classification can seem simple, but more often than not, it is a complicated and problematic operation. This class will engage with the quandary of classification in two related and highly contested areas: the mosaic of contemporary American identities and contemporary American literature(s). More precisely, we will examine the ways in which popular, distinctively American genres in film and fiction – including, but not limited to, the hard-boiled detective novel and film noir, the comic book and graphic novel, the Broadway musical, blaxploitation film, and the road movie – can be used to frame questions of identity and culture in different, surprisingly revelatory, lights. How do the specific, often controversial, formal elements of the works we will examine add to the ever-evolving dialogue around contemporary American culture? How do the authors and filmmakers we will discuss appropriate, adapt, and challenge the conventions of their chosen genres in order to elucidate questions of ethnic, racial, and sexual identity? These experiments and explorations in genre ask us to confront conventional representations of contemporary America: who makes them, for whom, and why? Furthermore, how do these interpretations of genre blur the margins between the literary and the popular (high versus low culture), center and periphery, “American” and “alien”?ReadingsSherman Alexie, FlightOctavia Butler, FledglingMichael Chabon, The Yiddish Policeman’s UnionJunot Diaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar WaoGene Luen Yang, American Born ChineseArt Spiegelman, MausCourse Reader with excerpts from additional primary, theoretical, and critical sources (available from ZeeZee Copy) ViewingsBill Condon, DreamgirlsDanny Leiner, Harold and Kumar Go to White CastleJustin Lin, Better Luck Tomorrow Quentin Tarantino, Jackie BrownQuentin Tarantino, Kill Bill: Vol. 1Selected episodes from Leave it to Beaver, The Cosby Show, Married… With Children, The Simpsons, All American Girl, and Ugly BettyCourse Catalog Number:

Session D 7/5-8/12 At the heart of this course is coming to terms with the question: what is an American? This is a fraught question; the answer seems everywhere self-evident, for many, yet what is or makes an American is radically contingent. In this course, we will approach the question of who, what, and/or how one is an American by focusing on three discrete historical time periods (settlement and colonization, the consolidation of the U.S. as an independent nation-state, and the late twentieth century) and by attempting to track the encounters of different sorts of people—different sorts of “Americans”—inscribed in narratives, plays, and novels. In the first phase of the class, we will read about and study the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans, how settlement and colonization were mutually catastrophic for colonizers and natives alike, and how representations of captivity contribute to our understanding of colonial (European) subjects and Native American “insurgents.” We will then explore the founding of the American Republic and register the transition from colony to nation, again focusing on the encounter between the newly constituted American citizens and their slaves. Finally, we will investigate the self-consciously multicultural United States of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century by focusing on the encounter between immigrants and sexual minorities—New Americans—with/in the United States and its peoples. Throughout the course, we will complement our understanding of “American” as U.S. citizens with texts from our American cousins from the “South” to help us complicate what it has meant to be an American from within and without the nation. Not only will we challenge and potentially generate new meanings for “American,” we will also engage in a discussion of the reified concepts of race, gender, and ethnicity as they intersect with competing notions of “American.” Course Catalog Number:

Session A 5/23-7/1Summer is the season of escapist fiction: if we can’t use our vacations to visit far-off climes in person, at least we can live vicariously through novels about distant, often imaginary places. Tales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments. Texts May Include: Captain Blood, directed by Michael Kurtiz“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Samuel Taylor ColeridgeThe Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Tempest, directed by Julie TaymorRobinson Crusoe, Daniel DefoeFoe, J.M.

Harsha Ram The novel is a modern genre, imported and adapted to Indian circumstances during the heyday of the British Empire. Over the course of the summer we will be reading British novels set in India, as well as novels written by Indian authors. We will be exploring how British fiction reflected on the “romance” of British Raj, the cultural differences and political hierarchies that arose between the rulers, the ruled, and the middlemen and women who mediated between them. The emergence of the Indian novel coincided with the rise of a new modernizing Indian élite that would lead India’s freedom struggle. The Indian novel thus became a crucial site for cultural debate. Was it possible to adapt western cultural forms while still questioning Britain’s political domination? What new insights could the novel’s narrative structure provide into Indian reality? How did the Indian novel encompass the bewildering multiplicity of local and regional voices, histories and narratives that constitute the Indian experience? How are we to understand the sudden emergence of Indian English literature on the world literary scene? These are some of the questions we will addressing over the course of the semester.Rudyard Kipling, KimRabindranath Tagore, GoraE.M. Forster, Passage to IndiaRaja Rao, KanthapuraG.V.

T. WolffPlease note this course is only open to students who have satisfied the first half of the Reading and Composition Requirement. This course experiments with different approaches to close reading through the diversions and subversions of comedy. We will get used to treating the forms of wordplay that provide most jokes with their punchlines as corresponding to aspects of literary style, from ambiguity to anticlimax, from clashing registers to the much-maligned pun. We will also look for ways that the same slipperiness of meaning plays a role in our own everyday speech habits, and in the media that saturate our social formation and participation. The course theme is intended primarily to attune the undergraduate reader and writer to fine stylistic distinctions in literary texts, but also secondarily to reveal, and to offer descriptive terms for, the ways language plays games in our lives at large. For this reason, we’ll read with an eye out for the ways language and comedy structure and reconfigure broader social themes, from gender and sexual politics, to childhood and family psychology, to the establishment of cultural and legal norms. As opposites to seriousness/reality, the relationships between comedy, dreams, theater, and pretense will guide our readings of concrete comic “correctives” (e.g., nonsense verse, surrealism, performance art, childhood play, and camp). The course balances texts from a range of genres and media (including film, television and advertising) with critical texts that suggest the unexpected force of play and the “comic attitude” in and out of literature. As always, students should be aware that an R/C course is especially writing-intensive, but in this course an additional willingness to pause over, discuss and play with linguistic details is a must.Readings• Aristophanes, Lysistrata• William Shakespeare, As You Like It• Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Ernest• Muriel Spark, Loitering With Intent• Harryette Mullen, Muse & DrudgeThere will also be a Course Reader consisting of 1) selected the poetry and prose of Emily Dickinson, Lewis Carroll, G.

A. GadberryIf the proliferation of floral print and crop tops or the planned remake of Point Break weren’t convincing enough, this fall’s fashion week paid homage to Sassy (beloved periodical of nineties teens), and the men’s magazine GQ joined the growing number of headlines in national newspapers and periodicals declaring that “we are likely entering a prolonged period of ’90s monomania.”This summer we’ll take our cue from this apparent pop culture imperative and examine novels, poetry, drama, film, television shows, albums, artworks, government documents, and the output of American news media as we analyze the roughly decade-long period between the falls of the Berlin Wall and the Twin Towers.  We’ll attempt to complicate facile accounts of the decade as we place the post-Cold-War dot-com-boom alongside the decade’s spectacular violence from Operation Desert Storm to the beating of Rodney King and subsequent LA Riots and many other events and scandals.  We will place particular emphasis on literary, artistic, and philosophical works and their relationship to popular culture, and our approach will be selective rather than exhaustive.  We’ll focus especially on race, ethnicity, and gender in the 1990s and on the aesthetics of grunge culture and Gen-X malaise.An abiding concern through our entire course will be in considering how the 1990s understood itself and how, or if, the apparent nostalgia for the ’90s in our present moment amounts to a longing for the decade George F. Will named, on September 12, 2001, “a holiday from history” (and we’ll test the legitimacy of Will’s assessment).  We’ll use close reading and rhetorical analysis to unfold texts literary and social, but we’ll also pose questions about periodization and ask how the invention of the Internet and the media of the 1990s constructed our perception of that historical moment, of the “real,” and of the continuities and discontinuities of the 1990s with the present.Assignments will include two short papers, a project, and several small assignments and creative exercises.In addition to some in-class screenings of TV episodes (e.g., My So-Called Life, Twin Peaks), music videos, and film, there will be weekly film screenings outside of our scheduled class time.  Students will be required to attend at least three of these outside screenings.  Some possible films for this series include: Greg Araki, The Living End (1992); Cameron Crowe, Singles (1992); Spike Lee, Get on the Bus (1996); Jennie Livingston, Paris is Burning (1990); Todd Solondz, Happiness (1998); Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994); and Larry and Andy Wachowski, The Matrix (1999).Required Works (available for purchase at ASUC Bookstore)Denis Johnson, Jesus’ Son

 M. Gordon This is a course about people who fall short, plans that go bust, and stories that don’t turn out like you thought they would. Not that you’ll be spending the summer suffering through a series of tragic disappointments. For as we explore the making and unmaking of lofty ambitions, romantic aspirations, prophecies, and personal and collective ideals, we will also be questioning whether they’re all they’re cracked up to be, or even worth pursuing in the first place. Where do these enthralling, often crushing expectations come from? In what way do they shape our attitudes towards the past, the present, and the future? How are they framed within artistic works? With what preconceptions do we approach these works, and how might they respond to those preconceptions? Whether as characters, narratives, or readers, could going halfway, amiss, in the opposite direction, or nowhere at all towards fulfilling expectations—going somewhere completely unexpected—bring its own rewards?Please purchase the following texts in the editions specified:Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot (Grove; ISBN 978-0802130341)

From Virgil’s epic of state-building to Petrarch’s coronation as poet laureate of Italy in the fourteenth century or Langston Hughes’ poem “Let America Be America Again,” writers have always reflected upon, critiqued, and embodied national identities in poetry. Think of how much the Aeneid exemplifies Rome and her history, or Walt Whitman’s exuberant “Leaves of Grass” defines the expansive American landscape and spirit. In this course, we will explore how (North) Americans – natives, settlers, slaves, and immigrants – have crafted American identities in poetry and imagined America as land, birthright, culture, and nation.By the seventeenth century when the first European settlers came to America, Europe had an infrastructure for the production and circulation of poetry. Court and patronage culture provided financing and context, publishers produced texts swiftly with the printing press, and reading communities of scholars, churchmen, aristocrats, and merchants were well established. This would not be true of America for many years – centuries even – and this course will begin by exploring the sorts of unconventional – and often oral – verse that was produced in America in the colonial and Revolutionary period. We will approach these forms and their authors by way of the spaces that produced them: the church, the field, the schoolroom, the prison, the house, the battlefield. Thinking in terms of space rather than genre or poetic form will allow us to integrate and compare different populations of Americans in a way that bisects racial, economic, and gendered groups; the ethnic groups upon which we will focus – Native Americans, European settlers, and African-Americans – can also be thought of in terms of cross-racial and trans-historical groupings – prisoners, students, workers, worshippers.Thus, the first half of this course construes American “poetry” broadly, as oral and written texts with lyric qualities – rhyme, meter, song. By the nineteenth century, however, poets began to emerge. The second half of the course, covering the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, addresses two figures and one movement that defined American poetry: Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and the Harlem Renaissance (with a particular focus on Gwendolyn Bennett, Langston Hughes, and Claude McKay). These poets developed singularly American voices by thematizing American spaces – the open land, the city, the garret. Finally, the course will draw to a close by studying the Bay Area’s rich poetic history: San Francisco poetry, the California small press movement, and the great poets currently teaching at Berkeley. Thinking about local poetry will further deepen students’ appreciation for the bonds between local spaces and identities, and poetry. We explore the spaces of the bookstore (City Lights), the press-room, and the library (the Bancroft).The course does not presume to provide a complete survey of American poetry. Instead, students will gain expertise in three different areas. First, the mechanics of literary form and how to read and analyze both metrical and free verse. Secondly, knowledge of several crucial figures, poetic forms, and poetic movements: for example, Anne Bradstreet, the spiritual, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, the blues, the Harlem Renaissance, California poetry. Finally, students will explore in depth the relationship between poetry and nation, and how poetic texts have produced a wide range of American identities. Through these diverse moments, and with the help of critical texts and supplementary sources in prose, images, and music – journals, captivity narratives, sermons, songs, paintings, newspaper articles – we will interrogate the ways poets have cobbled together an American identity from disparate sources and in wildly varied voices. Course Catalog Number:

Does vacation require something exceptional: travel, beaches, family and/or friends?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 28205

Katie KadueFrom cowboys to captains of industry, from old-money gentlemen to new-world adventurers, from uniformed soldiers to mold-breaking mavericks, Americans have long looked up to masculine heroes. Meanwhile, those who fail to conform to conventional standards of masculinity – effete intellectuals and stay-at-home dads, cuckolded husbands and 40-year-old virgins – earn society’s mockery and scorn. In this course, we’ll ask how assumptions about masculinity (and femininity) inform representations of men in texts, films, songs, and images, and what contradictions complicate them.   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 28230

Jordan GreenwaldThis course will examine a long legacy of cultural fascination with domestic space and its iconic caretaker, the housewife. We will discuss literary texts and films that feature housewives as their protagonists, from Milton to Virginia Woolf to the present. Our task will be twofold: we will work to appreciate, on the one hand, how the texts engage with a longstanding (and ongoing) feminist critique of the tethering of women to domestic labor; on the other hand, we will try to understand why the housewife endures as a key aspect of the fantasy of “the good life.” What can literary representations of housewives tell us about the aspirations and assumptions surrounding our everyday lives – in the past and in the present?This is a writing-intensive course, and we will explore all of these issues as a means of refining writing skills. Students will write and re-write a number of essays, and writing “workshops” will occur on a weekly basis. The final portion of the course will be spent on developing research skills, and will culminate in a research paper on one of the texts we have studied.Required Texts:Henrik Ibsen, A Doll’s House

Kathryn CrimAmerica has a special romance with what’s underground: from the Gold Rush to the oil fields to fracking, we’ve long imagined a secret store of wealth and resources beneath the soil, even as we also fear enough won’t ever be found there. In California especially, a legacy of worrying and warring over the groundwater stretches from the “water wars” of the early 20th century to our most recent ballot Proposition 1, which sought to manage the care and movement of water to various parts of the state.There is, of course, another American underground: the sites and networks of cultural innovation, political radicalism, and social protest. In the 19th century, ex-slaves escaped the southern United States along an Underground Railroad of sympathetic abolitionists. In the 20th century various groups continued to borrow on this figurative notion of being “underground”: the dissident Weather Underground, an avant-garde movement of “underground film,” even Lou Reed and John Cale’s Velvet Underground; feminist, queer, and socialist activists have often gathered “underground.” And sometimes underground is nothing more than an idea of retreat, refuge, or the grave.This summer we’ll go on a tour of subcultures and subterranean byways, asking after the relationship between what’s literally stored or moving beneath the earth and what is figured as “underground” thought, action, music, or art. Is there an intimate connection between what’s taboo (or even criminal) and new forms of cultural production? From the dark streets of Los Angeles, to the oil fields of New Mexico, along the snaking subway, and into the basement, we’ll draw on a diverse collection of texts—films, poetry, music, fictional and nonfictional narrative, protest literature, and critical essays. We’ll be particularly attune to how and why the “underground” seems like such an important metaphor for acts of resistance and experimental forms of representation. And we’ll ask what happens when what lies beneath emerges suddenly (sometimes in a gush or a flood) on the surface.Films and Photography and Music:Roman Polanski, Chinatown

According to its own mythology, there is no better place than L.A. to realize the quintessentially American dream of leaving the past behind and making one’s own destiny. And if L.A. considers itself the ideal setting for American self-fashioning, it also bills itself as the product of such a process: a city of big dreams and endless possibilities, built against the blank canvas of the desert.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 28230

Simona SchneiderThis class proposes to look at journeys of self-discovery that are also a discovery of diversity in the  American racial and cultural makeup as depicted in films and poems predominantly from the 1970s. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to end racial discrimination that prevented African Americans from voting, an important structural change, however attitudes surrounding the implementation of these rights continue to pose problems today.   »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 28225

																	Fiction is full of characters who exert a pull on their readers: those in whom we see versions of ourselves, those for whom we sense an immediate bond of friendship or feel an intense enmity, those we hate to love or love to hate, and those who remain forever inscrutable no matter how hard we try to get inside their thoughts and feelings. While one of our first instincts as readers may be to respond to such characters in terms of attraction and aversion, as friend or as foe, we’re also told repeatedly that one of the cardinal sins of serious literary engagement is to “identify” with the figures who populate the worlds we read about, who are, after all, mere words on the page.  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 20102

								This course will trace the legacy of an American genre, the horror story, from the nineteenth century to the present.We begin with famous writers of the American Renaissance (Hawthorne, Irving, Poe) and inquire about why the horrors of Dark Romanticism are at the very roots of American literary culture. What is it about the cultural and physical landscape of nineteenth-century United States that makes it so fertile for the writing of horror? In what ways are the horrors of nineteenth-century American history (slavery, settler colonialism, empire) registered and represented in Gothic and supernatural stories, and in what ways do they remain merely “specters”? What can the horror story of the nineteenth century teach us about racial dynamics then and in the present?  »  read more  »Course Catalog Number: 20106

A. NesbetIn this class we will take a close and multi-faceted look at books written primarily for children, a category of literature that remains rather under-examined, despite its popularity, persistence, and influence.  We will read examples of stories for children written in a number of different times (from the 18th to the 21st centuries) and places (Europe, Britain, North America), and our readings will make use of many different kinds of literary analysis:  historical contextualization, analyses that draw on particular literary theories, psychoanalytical approaches, and close readings.  We will also pay some attention to the development of the children’s literature industry in the United States.  Readings will include, on the one hand, stories by writers like the Brothers Grimm,Carlo Collodi, Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, Tove Jansson, Madeleine L’Engle, and E. B. White, and, on the other hand, Propp, Freud,Bettelheim, Derrida, Foucault, Genette, and Garber.There are a number of out-of-print books required (in unabridged form) for the class that students may have at home or be able to find used:  Johanna Spyri, Heidi [1880]; Laura Ingalls Wilder, Little House on the Prairie [1935];  Lois Lenski, Judy’s Journey [1947]; Jane Langton, The Diamond in the Window[1972].   (There will also be a Reader with secondary materials and excerpts.)

Ulf OlssonAlready in classical antiquity, writers were being expelled from their native countries – and this continues even today. But exile might be chosen and voluntary, or forced, it might be an inner or an outer exile. Modern literature, in particular, displays different aspects of exile, and the development of modernist literature is closely related to different forms of exile. Many of the great, pioneering modernists performed their work in countries other than they were born in: James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Samuel Beckett… The interconnectedness of modernism, emigration, exile and the internationalization of literature is discussed in this course, as well as the importance of exile for the construction of self and identity, experiments in language and aesthetic renewal. Critical and theoretical key concepts that will be central to the course are inner and outer exile, voluntary and forced exile, modernism, world literature, experiments in language, and the construction of identity.Comp Lit 100:1

K. McCarthyIn many genres and periods, marriage has been the privileged choice for marking a text’s “happy ending.” Why should this one social institution have come to stand as the symbol of the plot’s resolution? What assumptions about both marriage and narrative does this choice imply? In this class, we will examine not only texts in which the marriage plot plays its predictable role but also texts in which it is thwarted, parodied or inverted. We will approach these texts both from the viewpoint of narrative structure and from the viewpoint of social or ideological frames of meaning. We will mostly focus on three genres (drama, lyric poetry and the novel), and on three periods (classical Greece and Rome, early modern Italy and England, nineteenth-century England and France). Among the authors we’ll be reading are Shakespeare, Petrarch, Catullus, Trollope, Austen, Balzac and Wilde. We will also read some selected scholarship and theory to help us orient ourselves to the important questions in the texts. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

M. LuceyThe literary critic, Mikhail Bakhtin, once commented that “the novel as a whole is an utterance just as rejoinders in everyday dialogue or private letters are.”  Of course we often talk in loose ways about literary texts (among others) as being part of a large “conversation.”  In this course we’ll try to treat Bakhtin’s proposition seriously and rigorously.  What would be the larger language on which an author would draw to make a specific novelistic utterance?  How could one such novelistic utterance be taken to be a rejoinder to another.  What training is required in order to be able to listen in on a conversation like this?  We will read a series of six novels that might possibly be taken to be participating in a couple of related conversations.  We will also read theoretical and critical texts to help us develop our thinking about novelistic utterances and the ways they take on meaning. Novels:  Walter Scott, The Antiquary;  Balzac,  Cousin Pons; Henry James, The Spoils of Poynton; William Faulkner, As I Lay Dying, Maryse Condé,  Crossing the Mangrove, Robert Pinget, That Voice.

Dr David WalterThis class looks critically at the moments where philosophy intersects with narrative, myth, and figuration. Where does philosophy fall back on the imagination in order to explore its principles?  Conversely, how do writers and artists borrow from philosophic ideas to construct their imagined worlds?Starting with the Pre-Socratics and Plato, moving on to Descartes and the Enlightenment skeptics, and finishing with a treatment of Existentialism and Phenomenology, we will examine the role of the imagination in debates about perception, reality, and “thinghood.” In the course of this historical survey of thought, we will study works of literature and art that reflect back on the boundaries of the philosophical.Includes works of Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Plato,Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Nietzsche, Freud, Sartre, and Heidegger.  Selections of literature from Homer, Ovid, Calvino, Camus, P.K.

Jeffrey WeinerA survey of “fantasy literature” and some of the literary, philosophical, and psychological issues attached to it. Beginning with Near Eastern and Hellenistic creation myths, we will then move on to the Byzantine and Roman novels. The course will cover fairy tales, medieval allegory and chivalric tales, Renaissance romance, and culminate in more recent syntheses of these traditions. We will consider how these tales comment on morality, the family, cultural history, and ideology. How do these tales tap into a “collective unconsciousness,” urge reform, provide escape, and encourage cultural creativity? The course is writing and reading intensive, and students will be expected to develop research and writing skills.Texts:Bible, Selections from the Book of Genesis.

C.

We will focus on close readings of selections from the Hebrew Bible in English translation in conjunction with a series of poems written in different languages that make central use of these biblical sources, from William Blake to Leonard Cohen, from Itzik Manger to Yehuda Amichai, and from Rilke to Else Lasker-Schuler. One underlying concern of the course will be the function of various types of biblical intertextuality (allusion, parody, translation, etc).  We will explore the ways modern poets confront and transform their literary antecedents, and the manners in which a literary tradition articulates itself through a process of restless allusion in general, and the rewriting of biblical narrative and poetry in particular. No previous familiarity with the Bible is presumed, and thus one of the goals of the course will be learning to read and to appreciate the distinctive literary structures and conventions of the Bible.

Or does it instead provide dangerous  temptations and immoral models, leading readers astray?Comparative Literature R1A:1T/Th 8:10-9:30, 210 DwinelleSpring 2017Laura Wagnerl.wagner@berkeley.eduBook Learning:What Can Literature Teach Us?Can a work of the imagination teach us anything about real life? Can literature make us better people or thinkers, and if so, how does it convey its moral or intellectual lessons? Or does it instead provide dangerous  temptations and immoral models, leading readers astray?  What distinguishes a good reader from a bad reader, and how do literary texts ask us to relate to their stories? How does the form of a literary text act on its readers? Where should we locate the value of a literary work: in the lessons it can teach us, in the entertainment it provides, in the beauty of its form and expression, or somewhere else?These are just some of the questions that we’ll explore in this course, and we’ll approach them by reading and discussing a range of novels, short stories, poems, plays, and essays from a number of literary traditions and time periods. We’ll look at texts that are skeptical about literature and its influence, meeting characters who overly-identify with the fictional worlds they consume in books and are led astray by bad reading practices. We’ll consider works that put forth defenses of literature and its educative potential and whose authors think literary texts, and art more generally, might be an essential part of our intellectual, social, moral, or political formation. We’ll also evaluate arguments about different types of literature, examining how the form of a text acts on its readers.With these literary works as our common terrain, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading and analytical writing skills, learning to become more careful readers and to advance increasingly complex interpretive arguments about literary texts. Course requirements include active class participation, daily in-class reading responses, a diagnostic paper, two close reading papers, and first and revised drafts of two analytic papers. Students in this course can expect to read (and reread) carefully and to write extensively over the course of the semester.Required Texts:*Jane Austen, Northanger AbbeyChina Miéville, EmbassytownClaudia Rankine, Don’t Let Me Be LonelyMary Shelley, Frankenstein*Wherever you choose to purchase your books, please buy the specific edition on order in the university bookstore.  Please obtain hard copies (as opposed to e-books) of all required course texts.A course reader will contain Antigone by Sophocles, “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote” by Jorge Luis Borges, “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas” by Ursual K.

																	What is the relationship between literature and revolution? Can works of art and literature address political reality in a way that journalism or nonfiction can’t?  Can political art be more than mere propaganda? What does it mean to call an idea, a work of art, or a scientific theory “revolutionary”? What is the connection between revolutionary aesthetics and revolutionary politics?In this course we’ll explore various manifestations of the artistic avant-garde and the desire to transform life through art. We’ll read a number of experimental poets and examine how their play with language opens up different political possibilities. We’ll also study the political fear and hope expressed by art and literature inspired by the historical revolutions in Haiti, Russia, and elsewhere. And, in order to think about the crucial link between the humanities and sciences, we will read Ursula Le Guin’s The Dispossessed, a science-fiction novel about an extraordinary scientist and an anarchist revolution, alongside Thomas Kuhn’s theoretical work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.A central premise of this class is that thinking about complex questions like these is best accomplished through extensive writing and rewriting. This course will imagine the practice of writing as means of exploring new ideas and clarifying thinking. It will focus on the process of writing and consider the many choices, both simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating interpretations of a literary text to a reader.Texts will be drawn from the following:Fuenteovejuna by Lope de VegaReflections on the Revolution in France by Edmund BurkeBattleship Potemkin directed by Sergei EisensteinNotebook of a Return to the Native Land (Cahier d’un retour au pays natal) by Aimé CésaireExplosion in a Cathedral (El siglo de las luces) by Alejo CarpentierThe Dispossessed by Ursula K.

																	A group of Chicano/a artists spray paint the exterior of an art museum in protest of the museum’s exclusionary practices. An African-born woman writes poetry about the experience of becoming a slave.  The son of a dying woman journeys to a land of the dead hoping to meet his long-lost father and reclaim his inheritance.  A Native American man spends twenty-four hours trying to earn money to buy back a family heirloom. A black woman abandons her home and previous marriages in search of true love. What does it mean to own property? What does it mean to inherit property—to share or withhold it from the ones you love?  What does it mean to reclaim property? What does it mean to become property? What does it mean to forsake or destroy it?In this course, we will examine and explore the social dynamics of private property and consider the question of property in relation to the supernatural and the aesthetic. Is there a supernatural dimension to the concept of private property? What, if anything, do the properties and possessions of the living have to do with the dead? Does property produce an aesthetic? These are some of the questions we will explore throughout the semester. Readings may include: Juan Rulfo’s Pedro Páramo, Gabriela Mistral’s “Los sonetos de la muerte / Death Sonnets,” Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Sherman Alexie’s “What You Pawn I Will Redeem,” poems by César Vallejo and Phillis Wheatley, readings from Marx, art by Asco, and more.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	“A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism.” So begins the most famous and consequential manifesto of history. Marx and Engels’ Communist Manifesto inaugurated a new genre of writing that has influenced countless other manifestos—as well as literary texts, artworks, and political movements of course—since its publication in 1848.  What is a manifesto?What are its formal and generic features? What rhetorical strategies do manifestos typically employ? What relationship with history do they tend to assert? What, if anything, do they share with more purely “aesthetic” or “literary” modes of writing? In this course we’re going to read several of the major manifestos of the past two centuries broken up into the following five categories: Politics, Aesthetics, Feminism, Race/Colonialism, and Environmentalism. We will also study related forms such as the declaration, the vindication, the ars poetica, the jeremiad, the protest novel, and the encyclical. This is a writing intensive course. Students will write and revise a number of analytical essays over the course of the semester along with various shorter writing assignments, including their own manifestos.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	What does it means for a text or an image to be “haunted” – by the dead, by past traumas, or by occluded memories? What do “supernatural” occurrences in literature and cinema tell us about the visible and the invisible, about the material and the spectral, about belief and disbelief, or about reality and the imagination?In this course, we will encounter ghostly apparitions from a wide variety of time periods, genres, and cultures. Works will include, among others: Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Balzac’s Colonel Chabert, stories by Poe and Hoffmann, Rulfo’s Pedro Pàramo, and Hitchcock’s Vertigo.This course fulfills the first half of the University’s Reading and Composition (R&C) requirement and is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical reading and writing skills.

																	“America! I put the word on a page, it is my keyhole,” writes Russian-Jewish- American poet Ilya Kaminsky in a poem that describes his journey from the Soviet Union to America. In this class, we will read travelogues, essays, fiction, non-fiction and poetry by Europeans who have visited, settled in or even “conquered” America. What can these authors tell us about America that the locals do not notice? Can we trust their accounts? How do these authors’ perceptions of their own countries change and what do they discover when they decide to travel back East? Why does it matter that some of them write in English?Our transatlantic texts will be drawn from a variety of historical periods and cultures. By engaging with a number of historically relevant texts, starting with The Diario of Christopher Columbus, we will critically examine the myths of European presence in America. By reading contemporary writers, such as, among others, Vladimir Nabokov, Czesław Miłosz, Joseph Brodsky, Lara Vapnyar and Aleksandar Hemon, we will discuss how the “American dream” has been shaped by recent developments in European history, in particular the Cold War and its aftermath.This is writing intensive course. Through a series of workshops, peer reviews and tailored assignments, we will learn the fundamentals of college-level analytical writing. Based upon your critical interpretations of the texts, you will complete a number of graded assignments, including a diagnostic paper and four analytical papers (two of which will include revisions). Other requirements will include weekly reading responses as well as in-class participation.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Kathleen McCarthy(Comparative Literature Majors can satisfy either their Period Requirement or the Classical Literature Requirement with this class)Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes.  In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly inter-dependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary constructs such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious ideas such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology. In addition to primary literary readings, students will also be required to read secondary works on ancient religion and literature. In addition to some briefer writing exercises, two papers and a final exam are required.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Frank BeznerOften labelled as ‘courtly’ love, medieval love literature is of a rich, complex, and challenging variety: intellectuals write (in Latin) about the anxieties and traps related to falling in love; monks send their love poetry to nuns; French nobles negotiate power and dependency by writing abouth ‘their’ desire; professional singers create and perform highly dense literary fabrics about their unreachable lady; authors of romances explore the tensions between being a ruler and falling in love; mystics interpret (and write about) their religious experience as sensual love.Our course will explore this variety. In the first half we will closely read and compare a significant number of both ‘classic’ and less known Latin and vernacular love lyrics from the High Middle Ages: authors read include Baudri of Bourgeuil, Peter of Blois, Andreas Capellanus (Latin), William of Aquitaine, Marcabru, and Bertrand of Ventadorn (French), Heinrich of Morungen, Reinmar and Walther of the Vogelweide (German). In the second half we will mainly read and compare some medieval (Arthurian) narratives centered around the problem of love (Erec, Tristan), but at the end also discuss the fusion of religious lyrics and love lyrics.In reading and comparing these texts we will engage in literary analysis (form, imagery, recurrent elements, principal ideas, beginnings/ends, construction of a speaker/’I’, performance), explore the intersections of love literature and other discourses (medical, theological, legal), and discuss the relationship between our texts and the complex intellectual and social milieus in which they originated.Students must read at least one of the above languages, and a some knowledge of Latin is helpful, but not required. All texts will be available both in the original and in translation. Students must be willing to engage in intensive close reading and are expected to contribute actively to class. One oral presentation, one mid-term and one final paper will be required.Books: Course reader (for the poems) on bspace. Erec and Enide (Chretien de Troyes, tr. Staines ), Erec (Hartman of Aue, tr.

In this course we will read a number of seminal texts from one of the most innovative, multi-dimensional, aesthetically complex, and lasting literary traditions in the European Middle Ages: the literature on love (or, as often, but misleadingly labeled, on “courtly love”). Exploring this rich tradition via different genres, we will read vernacular and Latin love lyrics (e.g. Troubadour poetry, German Minnesang and Carmina Buarana), vernacular romances (e.g. Erec and Tristan), and theoretical treatises on love.  In reading and comparing these texts we will engage in literary analysis (form, imagery, recurrent elements, principal ideas, beginnings/ends, construction of a speaker/’I’, performance), explore the intersections of love literature and other discourses (medical, theological, legal), and discuss the relationship between our texts and the complex intellectual and social milieus in which they originated.As no familiarity with the Middle Ages is required, we will discuss (sometimes after lectures, but mostly in a seminar format) some basic aspects of medieval literary culture, among them: authorship, literary institutions, manuscripts, the performance of literature. In consequence, the course can also be attended as an introduction into medieval literature and literary culture.Language requirements: We will read texts in Latin, French, and German (with an emphasis on Latin and German). As medieval Latin, and particularly French/Occitan and German markedly differ from their modern form, all texts will be made available in English (mostly by bilingual editions). Students with knowledge of Latin, French, and German will profit from encountering an unknown variety of ‘their’ language, so in addition to English training in one other language (Latin or French or German) is recommended. Students should be prepared to engage with both a broad variety of texts and intensive close-reading.Some of the texts we read:–          selected Troubadour poems by Jaufre Rudel, Bernart de Ventadorn, Marcabru–          selected poems from Minnesang (Walther of the Vogelweide, Heinrich of Morungen)–          selected poems from the Carmina Burana (tr. Walsh)*–          Andreas Capellanus, On Love (extracts)–          Chretien of Troyes, The Knight of the Cart (tr. Staines)*–          Hartmann of Aue, Erec (tr. Tobin)*–          Gottfried of Strasbourg, Tristan (tr. Hatto)*–          possibly: Dante, Vita Nuova (tr. Cervini/Vasta)*All love poems will be made available in bilingual editions via bspace. Those marked with an asterisk, I recommend for buying.

Our focus will be on the ways in which authors such as Shakespeare, Cervantes, Montaigne, and their contemporaries respond to the new European voyages of “exploration” to the New World, Africa, India, and China.  Works by major literary authors will be read in conjunction with selections from writings by and about explorers,  ambassadors, navigators and pirates.  The course will offer both an introduction to the literature of the Renaissance, and a reflection on issues involving cross-cultural encounters, the rise of empire, and the relationship between writing and travel.Books on Order:Cervantes, Don Quixote (Penguin)Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel (Penguin)Camoens, The Lusiads (Oxford World’s Classics)More, Utopia (Yale University Press)Shakespeare, Othello (Signet)Shakespeare, The Tempest (Signet)Columbus, The Four Voyages (Penguin)Supplementary materials will be made available on bSpace or in Xeroxed form.Comp Lit 153:1,

D. PirilloAlso listed as Italian Studies 160: 2In what sense can our contemporary multicultural global world be traced back to the Renaissance? Did the Renaissance take place only in Florence, Rome, Venice and a few other Italian city states, or did it extend itself beyond Europe to include Africa and Asia? Intertwining history, literature, art and anthropology, this course will introduce students to the global Renaissance, stretching its traditional boundaries and examining Italy’s multiple exchanges with Northern Europe and the Muslim Mediterranean, as well as with the New World and the Far East. Along with the recovery of classical antiquity, the Renaissance was marked by a deep interest in the relationships between Christianity and the other ‘religions of the book’, Judaism and Islam, which nourished an intense debate on the notions of religious tolerance and cultural variety, eventually contributing to defining the modern notions of freedom and human rights. In order to examine the Renaissance encounters between East and West, the course will take into account not only written texts but also the connections between words and images, which shaped the visual culture of the period. Along with Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Erasmus, Luther, Montaigne and several others, special focus will be devoted to the representations of cultural encounters produced by Renaissance artists, engravers and mapmakers, such as Bellini, Giorgione, Vecellio, Holbein, and Durer. For this reason, lectures will not take place only in class but also in the reading rooms of the Bancroft Library to help the students to familiarize themselves with its rich collections and to explore the fascinating world of Renaissance print and visual culture.Course RequirementsActive participation, quizzes, oral presentation, final paper.Course is taught in English We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor R. KaufmanCourse Description: Seminar-lecture mix. Emphasis on close reading–lots of reading, and lots of careful re-reading!–with particular attention to the formal poetic-aesthetic dynamics (including metrics, tone, genre, structure, and related matters of form and style) and ethical/sociopolitical engagements of the poetry of the major “Beats” and of those poets from the United States whose work and dates overlap with the Beat movement, including Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Peter Orlovsky, Diane Di Prima, Gregory Corso, Michael McClure, Gary Synder, Bob Kaufman, Anne Waldman, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Philip Whalen, Joanne Kyger, John Wieners, Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser, Denise Levertov, Robert Creeley, John Ashbery, Frank O’Hara, Barbara Guest, James Schuyler,  et al); some brief re-considerations of Modernist predecessors, including William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), Bertolt Brecht, Federico García Lorca,
Louis Zukofsky. While the course will spend vastly more time on poems than on documentary and contextual materials, we will pay significant attention to political and cultural pressures and movements–inside and outside the U.S.–that the poetry encountered, was at least partially shaped by, and in some cases helped re-shape. With reference to our course title: “At Home” will mean the poems written, and usually first published, in the U.S. (almost always in English);”Abroad” will mean consideration of three things: (1) the European, Canadian, Caribbean, Latin American, Asian, and/or African influences on the U.S. Beats and allied experimental poets, and in some cases, the poets’ experiences traveling, living, and working outside the U.S.; (2) translations–literally, of Beat poems; metaphorically, of Beat or alternative culture–into the poetry, criticism, and culture of French, Spanish, and German-speaking countries; and (3) poems written by European, Canadian, Caribbean, Latin American, Asian, and African poets who found themselves influenced by–or who found themselves in dialogue with­-Beat and related experimental U.S. poetry. In addition to poetry and poetry-focused literary and sociopolitical criticism, we will look at some works of cinema and philosophy.(Note on non-English texts: Students will not be required to have proficiency in languages other than English, although ability to read in Spanish, French, and/or German will benefit students significantly, since we will often shuttle between those languages and English as we compare original and translated versions of various poems.)Comp Lit 155:1

K.BrittoIn this course we will read a number of literary texts set in colonized territories, largely though not entirely under French domination.  Dating from the turn of the twentieth century to the period of widespread decolonization a half-century later, these texts represent a variety of forms and genres (adventure novels, autobiographical fiction, philosophical novels, political denunciation and/or satire) and emerge out of a number of different cultural situations and geographic locations (including Southeast Asia, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa).  Some of the authors to be considered are firmly enshrined in the canon of modern European literature, while others write as colonized subjects engaging with European histories of exoticist representation.  In our discussions, we will consider the historical specificity of each text while remaining open to insights made possible by reading comparatively.  In other words, our goal will not be to synthesize a monolithic theory of literature and colonialism but rather to analyze individual texts while attempting to be attentive to common textual strategies, formal elements, and practices of representing colonial space, dynamics of power, and variously configured articulations of domination and resistance, civilization and savagery, modernity and tradition.  Readings will include: Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness, André Malraux, The Royal Way, Albert Camus, The Stranger, Marguerite Duras, A Sea of Troubles, Ferdinand Oyono, Houseboy, Cheikh Hamidou Kane, Ambiguous Adventure, Assia Djebar, Children of the New World. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Jill StonerAlso listed as ARCHITECTURE 136/236If interested in enrolling, please contact Professor Stoner at: jstoner@socrates.berkeley.eduINTRODUCTION The concept of space as it is applied to the fields of architecture, urbanism and geography can be understood as a barometer of the condition that we call “modernity.” Many spatial themes unique to modernity emerge in short fiction and novels; these themes overlap with developments in critical theory. This course will explore connections between the larger literary and cultural frameworks of the past century and the idea of space as it has been perceived, conceived and lived during this period.Adrian Forty’s essay on “Space” (Forty, 2000) provides an entry into the literature of the course. The course reader opens with this text, and includes some of Forty’s references, to which are added other key works from the disciplines of philosophy, geography, architecture, landscape, and urbanism. The readings are grouped according to themes that are in turn tied to the idea of space as a modern phenomenon. The themes will form the foundation for weekly seminar discussions.One reading from each group belongs to the consecutive decades of the 20th century. This structure is balance by thematic readings that are not chronological—thus revealing both the force of history upon the conceptualization of space, and its contradictions. This duality further clarifies a key theme within much of the literature—the displacement of history by geography as the essential quality of the modern condition. The weekly classes will begin with a very short introduction to key events and intellectual developments of the relevant decade.In addition to the theoretical readings, each week’s selection includes one or two works of twentieth-century short fiction, thus complementing the intellectual content with texts that reveal the geography of the imagination. Students will also read one novel from the period, which will serve as the foundation for the final paper.GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE1. To understand the relationship between the concept of “space” and the condition of modernity.2. To become familiar with key texts from a range of disciplines, and to explore the interdisciplinary themes that connect the texts. In particular, the course material explores links between the disciplines of architecture, geography and comparative literature3. To engage in a collaborative seminar in which ideas are discussed and debated.4. To learn to prepare a research paper as a sequence from abstract and bibliography, through draft form, then as a revised final text.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

H. Freed-ThallIn this course, we will read some of the most experimental and adventurous literature of the 20th century. Instead of understanding texts as mirrors of social reality, we will consider them as laboratories—spaces for testing out, working through, or mixing up new ideas, categories, and ways of seeing and feeling. We will pay special attention to 20th-century international avant-garde movements, including Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and we will explore the relation of the literary avant-garde to the avant-garde in painting, cinema, and music. Some of the experimental texts we will read engage specific scientific and philosophical theories, including Freud’s theory of the unconscious, Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of perception, and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Throughout the semester, we will be particularly attentive to the politics of literary form, the intimate relation between mass culture and the avant-garde, and the ways in which aesthetic experimentation manipulates perceptions of time and space.A course reader will include theoretical writings, short fiction, poetry, and manifestos by a variety of authors, including Marinetti, Apollinaire, Breton, Bataille, Leiris, Césaire, Proust, Kafka, Beckett, Borges, Ellison, Perec, Saussure, Freud, Benjamin, Shklovsky, Merleau-Ponty, Scarry, and Bürger.We will also read 5 or 6 novels. Please do not buy them until the first day of class, as the list is subject to revision.

Maria KotzamanidouThe purpose of this course is to present a broad selection of modern Greek short stories, from the last quarter of the nineteenth century through the last quarter of the twentieth, with a great range and variety in their style and focus. They range thematically, among others, from “ethographic fiction”, where customs and community loom large in the story, to the alienation of the individual and the anonymity of the urban space, to the psychological impact of the savagery of war, to idiosyncratic flights of individual imagination and states of the mind. The stories are arranged chronologically, in order to underscore the development of the genre, and are placed in a variety of contexts: literary, historical, social, psychological, political, economic.In the latter part of the nineteenth century, the increasing consciousness of Greece as a modern European nation intensified the efforts of writers and intellectuals to apply European literary standards to Greek fiction. These standards were gleaned from French, English, German and Russian translations of fiction which were published or serialized in newspapers and magazines. Thus, the modern Greek short story seems to have kept pace in its development with its European counterparts and, more recently, especially in the latter part of the twentieth century, with its North American ones.Unlike modern Greek poetry and the modern Greek novel, examples of which have circulated widely in foreign translation, the modern Greek short story, despite a few collections translated into foreign languages, remains virtually unknown outside Greece. As a genre, it has reflected, with a particular immediacy and sensitivity, the historical, social and intellectual climates that fostered it, and it has helped to highlight the contributions of women to contemporary literary culture.

M. KotzamanidouOpen to all students. Greek materials are available in the original as well as in English translation.“….Here was a sight! Six hundred persons, mostly widows and orphans, driven from their homes, hunted into the mountains like wild beasts, and living upon the herbs, grass and what they could pick up about the rocks….. I spent the day giving billets to the poor who came in from the surrounding mountains, where they lodge in holes and caverns, and who hearing of the distribution had come down for their share, and to eat bread the first time perhaps for months….” (Letters and Journals of Samuel Gridley Howe, Editedby Laura E. Richards, v.1, The Greek Revolution, p.242).Thus Samuel Gridley Howe, the American philhellene and philanthropist, describesthe events he witnessed. The Bostonian physician was responsible for the distribution of American aid to the Greek populations, toward the end of the Greek War of Independence. Pillaged by the revolutionary forces and retaliated upon by the armies of the Ottoman Empire, families in towns and villages paid, beyond the loss of human life, the ultimate price for the creation of the new nation. The above descriptions of Dr. Howe reflect but one example of the impact of historical crises on families. Urban or peasant, nuclear or extended, Greek families have had to contend with the vicissitudes of history, with divisive, inflamed political ideologies, the violence of war, with uprooting and diasporas. The Greek family was challenged in its eastern, traditional structure by modernity, and was displaced as a unit of production by economic progress. Its stories were often lost to canonical history. And yet, the voice of the family finds frequently reverberation in the voice of fiction.In this course, we will examine how fiction represents the effects of historical crisis on the  Greek family. Even though selfhood and individualism figure strong in Greek society, it is within the context of this basic human collective that we will approach the individual narrative voices and the central prose fiction characters.History, theory and criticism in English.

M. KotzamandiouIn 1844 the American sculptor Hiram Powers unveiled, in Boston, his nude statue, the first full scale American nude, by the title “The Greek Slave”. The fictional identity given to the subject, as stated in the pamphlet accompanying the tour of the statue in 1848, was that of a beautiful young Greek woman chained to a column, completely naked, ready to be sold in the Ottoman slave market. Since by 1844, the Greek War of Independence, which had effectively ended in 1827, had produced a miniscule, though free, European nation, images of chained bodies, replete with a background of Turkish violence, did not, exactly, represent the Greek historical reality.  The critical responses to the exhibit insisted that the statue, classical in style, reflected pathos rather than seduction. The woman, the newspapers wrote, was, clearly, Greece itself suffering in barbaric hands.  Since the statue continued to be reproduced through the 1860’s, the American public accepted it also as a part of the abolitionist discourse of slavery in the American society of the North, the fledgling feminist movement accepted it as an example of man’s oppression of women, and the Europeans accepted it as an image of the rhetoric of orientalism and Turkish barbarism still hovering about the sad remnants of the erstwhile powerful Ottoman Empire.Using the above materials as a springboard, this course intends to examine the relationship between the body and politics, between art, sexuality and nation, exemplified by the use of the female body in literature and film. The use of the woman’s body as a trope continues to reflect the national and nationalist politics in Greek literature and film in the 20th century.Please note:  There are no prerequisites for this course.  Tu/Thur 12:30-2 and film screening: Tuesday 2-4PM

S. VolppIn this senior seminar, we will examine our assumptions regarding the study of fictional character. Long-ingrained habits have trained us not to speak of characters as though they were implied people.  We will look at the history of the taboo on reading fictional characters in this way as it develops in twentieth century criticism, asking why a conception of character as an aesthetic instrument came to predominate and why a conception of a literary character as “full person” stubbornly adheres in even the most sophisticated writing on character. Contrasting key texts in the Euro/American and Chinese traditions, we will consider cultural historical differences in means of portraying interiority, in the treatment of the relationship between major and minor characters, and in the perception of the appropriate number of characters with which to populate a novel.Primary texts include Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice; Henry James,What Maisie Knew; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; the anonymous seventeenth-century Chinese novel Plum in the Golden Vase (Jin Ping Mei); Cao Xueqin, Story of the Stone (Hong lou meng). Critics include Peter Brooks, Sharon Cameron, Dorrit Cohn, Ann Banfield, Alex Woloch, Blakey Vermeule, and traditional Chinese commentators.

H. RamLiterature has always been linked to fantasy and magic, even as it has sought to imitate or approximate reality. The goal of the course is to reflect on the fantastical or derealizing impulse in literary narrative, from ancient myth, the folk tale and medieval romance to the revival of the fantastical in nineteenth-century romanticism and early realism, before moving finally to three 20th-century novels from Russia, Cuba and India, whose “magical realism” can be read as arising out of the productive collision between the pressures of modern history and the archaic legacies of myth and oral storytelling.  Structuralist, formalist, and other critical approaches to myth and fantasy will be explored. Authors to be read include E.T.A. Hoffmann, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Bulgakov, Carpentier and Rusdhie.

F. MasielloThis is a senior seminar devoted to the study of two modernist authors: the Irish writer James Joyce and the Argentinian Roberto Arlt. A paradox immediately confronts us when we draw such dissimilar and differently valued authors together: how can we competently situate Arlt, a marginal writer from the Latin American periphery, one who professes “to write badly” (while Borges, his local rival, makes claim to the precision of form), one who brings to literature the themes of delinquency and authoritarian rule, urban squalor, misogyny, and perversion, against the towering figure of Joyce, arguably the central figure of the modernist canon? Is comparison always based upon unequal conditions of literary production and unequal roads to success? What might this kind of comparative study reveal not only about strategies of writing, but about modernist inquiry as a whole? These questions of method will drive our discussions throughout the semester as we read, first, Joyce’s  Portrait of the Artist set against Arlt’s El Juguete rabioso (if in rewriting the genre of the Bildungroman, Joyce allows Stephen Dedalus to learn to become a writer while Arlt permits his character Silvio Astier to learn the art of theft and embezzlement, both writers depend on the force of literary traditions to define their characters’ pursuits; in other words, reading and citation mark the path toward self-realization) and, second, Joyce’s Ulysses placed against Arlt’s Los siete locos. Here, we will look at the ways in which these novels engage us with questions of modernity from the urban peripheries of Dublin and Buenos Aires. They will let us see how the tropes of the library and the circulation of mass and popular cultures govern very distinct scenes of literary imaginings and choice of language. Finally, these texts will show how the sentient body of modernism is shaped and stimulated by new technologies such as cinema, the phonograph, and the telephone, all of which suggest a tremendous anxiety about velocity and movement, distance and nearness, and signal the eternal gap between experience and representation.This course requires a good deal of wonderful reading. With luck, your knowledge of Spanish will be  good enough for the encounter. Several brief writing assignments are required and will lead to a substantial seminar paper on a comparative topic.  Active class participation required.Required texts:Roberto Arlt, El Juguete rabioso.

Sophie VolppIn this senior seminar, we will revisit an age-old problem in the study of fiction: How do readers become involved in the lives of literary characters? What criteria for such a relationship seem necessary to contemporary readers and critics? How does the representation of thought and feeling influence our conception of fictional character? And how did other periods and cultures construe such problems? We will consider two significant trajectories: the Victorian to the modernist novel, and the late sixteenth to the eighteenth century Chinese novel. Primary texts include Henry James, The Golden Bowl; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; Vladmir Nabokov, Transparent Minds; the Plum in the Golden Vase (Jin Ping Mei); and Cao Xueqin, Story of the Stone (Hong lou meng); critics include Peter Brooks, Sharon Cameron, Dorrit Cohn, Lisa Freeman, Catherine Gallagher, Bill Brown, Eve Sedgwick, Blakey Vermeule, and traditional Chinese commentators.

Jason Bodik“My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel–it is, above all, to make you see. That—and no more, and it is everything.”—Joseph ConradIn this course we will be reading and discussing a number of texts that concern themselves with questions of perception. How does a lyric poem allow us to see or feel something we’ve never directly experienced? How does the ability or inability clearly to see and understand a state of affairs affect the plight of a character, or the conflicts around which a plot revolves? Is language, though a verbal phenomenon, able somehow to change the way we perceive in our actual lives? If so, what types of real-world power does this ability imply for literature, and what light can it shed on the controversies that surround so many literary texts? Through wide-ranging in-class discussion and frequent writing assignments, we will explore these and other questions over the course of the semester.Readings:Sophocles, Oedipus RexWilliam Shakespeare, MacbethArthur Rimbaud, A Season in HellRichard Wright, Native SonMarguerite Duras, The LoverJorge Luis Borges, “Tlon, Ukbar, Orbis Tertius”Nikolai Gogol, “The Overcoat”Clarice Lispecter, “Journey to Petropolis”We will also be reading a number of shorter poems by authors including, but not limited to: Elizabeth Bishop, William Blake, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Pablo Neruda, Ezra Pound, Cathy Song, and W.

A. Francois“Sacrifice Literature” explores key concepts in critical theory (allegory, interpretation, latency, transference, sacrifice, image-making, textual pleasure, aesthetic value, the esoteric and exoteric, discipleship and discipline) and is designed as an introduction to representative critical debates in the field of comparative literature—debates concerning post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, post-colonial and subaltern studies, feminism, psychoanalysis, and the critique of secularism. Taking the course title as an imperative (as well as a noun-phrase), we will focus on scenes of sacrifice, iconoclasm, sublimation, renunciation, repudiation, exchange, enclosure and conversion, while giving special attention to literary theory’s ambivalence toward representation and its compliance with the taboo on images. We will also explore imperatives to “sacrifice literature” in the critique of literature as an institution, of the realm of aesthetic judgment, and of close reading as the prevailing technique of the discipline.Selections from Adorno, Agamben, Auerbach, Barthes, Bataille, Benjamin, Derrida, de Man, Fanon, Freud, Galeano, Guillory, Hegel, Henry James, Jameson, Barbara Johnson, Kafka, Kierkegaard, Lacan, Marx, Nietzsche, Ovid, Rousseau, Said, Silverman, Spivak, Strauss.

Barbara SpackmanThe Desire Called Comparative LiteratureHow does the discipline of Comparative Literature constitute its object of study in the year 2010? What is its relation to “world literature,” to “transnational studies,” or to “cultural studies”? How does the history of the discipline continue to shape the way we practice it? What is the place of the nation-state in that history, and how might different practices of comparative literature puncture, redraw, or reinforce national borders?   How do the institutional histories of the “national languages and literatures” persist in the work of comparatists?  In this seminar, we will explore these questions in readings drawn from a wide range of theorists and practitioners of comparative literature, including Erich Auerbach, René Wellek, Fredric Jameson,, Gayatri Spivak, Edward Said, Rey Chow, Kristin Ross, Aijaz Ahmad,  Wai Chee Dimock, Arjun Appadurai, and others.   For the final seminar paper, students will be asked to produce a manifesto for a “new” comparative literature.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

His plays depict the psychological, political, economic, and social upheavals that mark the transition from the pre-modern world to a world that is recognizably our own. But he is also the most international of all writers.This course will explore Shakespeare’s extraordinary literary originality by studying his most influential plays in an international context. We will locate Shakespeare in the culture of his period by reading his plays in dialogue with masterworks from across Renaissance Europe. We will consider how he and his contemporaries engage with issues of international scope at a time (like our own) of extraordinary political, religious, and economic turmoil.We will read eight major plays by Shakespeare, as well as works by such authors as Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Cervantes, and Petrarch. This course thus offers an introduction to early modern Europe, an exercise in reading literature in an international context, and an in-depth study of a major author.Reading List:Shakespeare, Hamlet, MacBeth, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Twelfth Night, Henry IV, Part I, The TempestMachiavelli, The PrinceRabelais, PantagruelMontaigne, “Of Cannibals”Petrarch and Wyatt, Selected SonnetsCalderón, Life is a DreamCervantes, Exemplary StoriesWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

G. HeadThe genre of autobiography is often assumed to offer faithful mimetic representations of individual life stories. In the West, it is generally thought to be characterized by a post-enlightenment sense of interiority or self-reflexion, considered a requirement of the genre. Through a survey of the genre’s central critical texts and examples of life-writing from both the Western and Arabic literary traditions this course will examine the biases we have when reading texts that offer a different portrait of selfhood than that found in the Western canon. The first part of this course will address the following questions: How has Rousseau’s canonical text shaped the way we read autobiography? How have the generic expectations set after the Enlightenment distorted our reading of Augustine’s work to create a false typology of autobiography’s historical development? How have our own cultural assumptions obscured the rhetorical strategies at work in the autobiographical text’s construction? If we adjust our own “horizon of expectations,” can we disprove the oft-repeated claim that Arabic autobiography before the twentieth-century did not exist? The second part of this course will explore how the genre of autobiography has been used in the Arab world in the twentieth-century to reconstitute the marginalized subject. Topics considered will be the generic difference between autobiography and the bildungsroman, Arab women’s autobiography, the autobiography of exile, the autobiography of the socially and economically disenfranchised, and the role of autobiography in the uprisings and revolutions generally referred to as the Arab Spring. Authors will include Saint Augustine, Jean Jacques Rousseau, al-Gahazali, Ibn ‘Ajibah, Taha Hussein, Leila Abouzeid, Assia Djebar, and Mahmoud Darwish among others. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

L. KurkeAlso listed as Classics 211The seminar will be devoted to consideration of archaic Greek choral poetry as embedded in its ritual and religious contexts (focusing mainly on Pindar’s epinikia, but possibly also including some compositions of Alkman, Simonides, and Bacchylides).  My starting point is the reflection that monodic lyric (e.g., Sappho, Alkaios, Anakreon), although it does not really conform to post-Romantic models of the privacy and subjectivity of lyric voice, is still much more accessible to a style of reading informed by post-Romantic assumptions.  Archaic choral lyric, in contrast, is often difficult, obscure, and inaccessible not just because it is fragmentary, but also because it is so deeply enmeshed in (partially or entirely lost) contexts of religious occasion and ritual action.  I would therefore like to approach the reading of epinikion by trying, insofar as it is possible, to reconstruct the ritual surround and re-embed therein the bare texts we possess.  This will entail simultaneous reading of other kinds of sources (e.g., epigraphic, later prose) to try to develop a “thick description” of archaic choral performance contexts. We will start with several weeks reading Plato’s Laws Books 1-3 and 7, and then move to choral lyric poetry.  Possibly some work on “Pindar and the Monuments,” setting individual poems or clusters of poems in their local religious/ritual /topographic contexts (e.g., P.4, P.5, P.9 in Kyrene; Pindar fr. 94b, P.11, I.1, I.3/4, I.7 in Thebes; Aeginetan Odes).  Comp Lit 212:1

Frank Bezner This course is meant as an exploration of Latin and vernacular medieval literary texts dealing with love and desire.  Its title points to its double intention: on the one hand we will study how medieval poems, letters, autobiographies, treatises discover, explore, complicate notions of self and subjectivity; on the other hand we will ask what is at stake when these texts negotiate love and desire – topics that are inextricably related to medieval institutions, social constellations, political practices, spiritualities, gender relations, and ethical norms. Literary analysis and cultural analysis ideally will work together towards genealogies of desire and love in which we identify the dynamics and forces by which the ‘genre’ of medieval love literature – often taken as granted – originates and develops.In a first part we will read a number of lesser known texts from around 1100: the playfully subversive, Ovid-driven love letters to nuns by monk Baudri of Bourgeuil; Guibert of Nogent’s “neurotic” (Benton) account of his own sexuality; saint’s lives by Hildebert of Lavardin in which the sexuality of hermits is explored; and poems by William of Aquitaine in which erotic drive and political aggression are fused. In the second part of the course we will carefully study the famous correspondence between Peter Abelard and Heloise (including some letters erroneously ascribed to them). A third part explores the negotiation of desire in Latin and vernacular (French, German) love lyrics.All texts will be made available in the original and in reliable translations. Knowledge of the Latin language is recommended, but not required. The course is also open to ‘modernists’ who want to explore unfamiliar pre-modern terrain.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Anthony CascardiThe early modern period has long been recognized as one of enormous transformations in the literature, thought, and culture of Europe.  Many of those have been linked to the emergence of the category of the modern “subject” and have been regarded as playing a formative role in the long history of modernity.  And yet many accounts of the formation of modernity fail to explain the emergence of subjectivity across the many fields in which it is implicated.This seminar will aim at an exploration of the conditions of possibility underlying these phenomena, focusing at once on historico-philosophical models and on cross-cultural materials.  We will consider evidence from the domains of literature (prose fiction, drama, lyric poetry), politics, philosophy, the essay, as well as materials relating to the visual arts.  Emphasis will be on readings from Descartes, Montaigne, Cervantes, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, More, Erasmus, and others.  Students will be required to work in original texts corresponding to their literatures of emphasis.   A final paper and one in-class presentation will be required.

An introduction to Renaissance humanism, focusing on the work of Petrarch, Bruni, Salutati, Valla, Machiavelli, Castiglione, Erasmus, More, Ascham, Elyot, Lipsius, and Shakespeare. In addition, we will read some of the classics of Renaissance scholarship (Burckhardt, Kristeller, Baron, Garin, Trinkaus, Greenblatt, Cave and Greene), as well as more recent work in the field. Topics will include Renaissance theories of imitation and literary production, the revival of classical rhetoric, humanist pedagogical practices, the civic and political function of rhetoric, the transformation of political theory, the relationship between Christianity and classical culture. We will also discuss the critique of humanism both in the early modern period and in modern evaluations of Renaissance humanist pedagogy by Grafton and Jardine, Halpern, Crane, Dolven and others. Reading knowledge of Italian or Latin is particularly useful but not required.This course satisfies the “intellectual history” requirement of the new Designated Emphasis in Renaissance and Early Modern Studies.

Anne-Lise FrancoisWhat contribution does the study of Romanticism have to make to current critical discourses such as ecocriticism and biopolitics concerned with animal/human divides and the relationship between place, language and politics?  Romanticism was once defined as a turn toward “nature” in response to the industrialization marking Western Europe’s transition to modern capitalism in the early nineteenth century.  Rather than simply resurrecting the idea of Wordsworth and others as “nature” poets, we will carefully examine the relationships between discourse and experience,figure and origin in these writers, while also searching for alternatives to the salvific or curative role often assigned both “nature” and “poetry”in environmentalist criticism.  Topics will include: the gendering of “nature”; the conflict between “modernity” and “modernization” and the role of marginalized communities; agriculture as a border-space between “culture” and “nature”; the role of memory and imagination in writing about place and the loss of place; weather-reporting and other practices of attention; fantasies about ecological disaster, social catastrophe, and science’s ability to save or destroy humankind.   As we compare different definitions of “nature”—as a set of finite, exploitable resources, a normative authority limiting human experimentation, a repository of traditional ways of doing and knowing, and a site of vulnerability in need of protection from extinction—we will also explore the alternatives to the nature/human binary developed by the writers in question.  Our readings will traverse British, North American, German and French contexts and will include works by Rousseau, Schiller, Goethe, Coleridge, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Malthus, Percy and Mary Shelley, Clare, Keats,Thoreau, Freud, Adorno and Horkheimer.

Adorno, and on their development of Kantian, Hegelian, and Marxian traditions of aesthetics and critical theory; sustained attention to how and why poetry turns out to be so crucial to the Frankfurters’ (and, in particular, to Benjamin’s and Adorno’s) overall analyses of modernity, mechanical/technical/technological reproduction or reproducibility (in both the economic and artistic-aesthetic spheres), and critical agency; consideration of how Frankfurt-School concerns and legacies might engage the changed sociopolitical circumstances and artistic-aesthetic tendencies–and the changed poetry–of the last three decades; analysis in turn of how later-modernist and contemporary poets’ work may challenge Frankfurt analyses of and assumptions about poetry, aesthetic experience, and critical agency themselves. Readings of poetry throughout the course will tend to emphasize formal, stylistic, and philosophical-theoretical matters in order to highlight the consideration of how–and to what degree–artistic technique, in relation to aesthetic form and aesthetic experience (most specifically, lyric experience), may offer stimulus toward and insight into historical, sociopolitical, and ethical understanding and engagement. Some treatment of Romantic and nineteenth-century poetry, and of 21st-century poetry, but the course will focus primarily on twentieth-century, modernist poetry (including modernist poetry written and published during the apparently postmodern period). As a shared project throughout the semester, the class will read and continue discussing together in a sustained manner two volumes of poetry (a facing-page French-English volume containing Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du mal [1857] and Le Spleen de Paris/Petits Poèmes en Prose [1869]; and Michael Palmer’s Sun [1988]), while for each week’s class, students and/or the instructor also will have distributed ahead of time xeroxed and/or PDF’d texts of work by other poets (whom they have will have chosen to present to, and discuss with, the rest of the class). Along with the ordered books listed below (which can be purchased at the ASUC Bookstore), a Course Reader will contain photocopied excerpts of additional required texts, including those by Kant, Hegel, Marx, Vallejo, Duncan, Benjamin, Adorno, Marcuse, Sartre, Beauvoir, Brecht, Mayakovsky, Neruda, Zurita, Celan, various of the Surrealists, Objectivists, WC Williams, Moore, Bishop, Stevens, Paz, Olson, Levertov, Duncan, Rich, and many others.(Additional Note: Texts of critical theory, philosophy, aesthetics, and/or criticism will be presented in English translation, though, with texts not initially written in English, we will frequently consider the German, French, or Spanish originals.  Poetry not originally composed in English will be read and discussed primarily in English translation, though we will almost always also consult a poem’s facing-page [or at-hand-xeroxed] original language–most often German, French, and Spanish [as well as other languages, depending on students’ poetry selections]. Knowledge of other languages–especially German, French, and Spanish–is not required, though it will prove very helpful.)Required Books:

M. Lucey Berkeley Arts Seminar Course*This seminar’s purpose will be to help us become informed listeners at the Kurt Elling concert sponsored by Cal Performances on Saturday, April 23, 2011. Elling’s latest album, “Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman,” won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album.  The seminar requires no musical training, and no previous acquaintance with jazz, although we’ll happily make use of any jazz expertise seminar participants may have.  We’ll study how jazz works as music, and how jazz works as a culture. The Elling concert will happen toward the end of the semester.  Throughout the semester we will watch and listen to some classic recorded jazz performances, as well as to live music (depending on the schedules that are announce for spring) by jazz musicians in events sponsored by the Music Department, or at the Jazzschool in downtown Berkeley, or at the world-famous jazz club in Oakland, Yoshi’s.  Please note that admission to events on campus will be provided at no cost to students.Our particular focus throughout the semester will be on how and why jazz musicians spend so much time listening to other jazz musicians and learning from them, and how they acknowledge what they’ve learned and who they’ve learned from during their own performances.  Of course our major case study will be Elling’s “Dedicated to You,” and the two albums on which it is based, “John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman” and  “John Coltrane Quartet-Ballads.”  But Elling has a long practice of recording tributes to jazz musicians who have inspired him, so we’ll also listen to and learn from earlier tribute tracks Elling has done, not only to Coltrane, but also to artists such as Dexter Gordon and Keith Jarrett. Along with our musical texts, we will also read a recent book by Ben Ratliff, “Coltrane: The Story of a Sound,” in order to understand the unique place Coltrane occupies in jazz history.  We’ll also be reading sections from Paul F. Berliner’s “Thinking in Jazz: The Infinite Art of Improvisation” to help us learn about how jazz music and jazz culture work.*Berkeley Arts Seminars are small, faculty-led seminars that give UC Berkeley

S. TollefsonPeople today don’t have enough poetry in their heads, and everyone should be able to recite one or two of their favorite poems. In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party sometime, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.”In this class we will read a number of “classic” poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types, and students will encouraged to find other poems for the group to read.Students will be required to memorize and recite between 50 and 75 lines of poetry throughout the semester. In addition, students will prepare a short anthology of their favorite poems, with an explanatory introduction for each poem.

K. McCarthyIn this class, we’ll examine the special form of communication that happens when we tell stories. Narrative is a such a common way of conveying information, attitudes or perspectives that it can seem almost to work invisibly, but part of our goal in this class will be to learn how stories work, why they take the forms they do, what effects can arise from specific choices in how they are told, etc.   Although we will study stories in some familiar realms (literature, journalism, film), we will also explore some recent debates as to the role of narrative in areas such as law, politics and medicine.Kathleen McCarthy is an associate professor of Classics and Comparative Literature.  Her scholarly work has centered on the interaction of literary forms and social institutions, for example, the role slavery plays in Roman comedy or the effects of social hierarchy on lyric form.  She teaches classes on a wide variety of topics including narrative theory, Latin poetry, religion in ancient literature and lyric in historical context.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Niklaus LargierSo-called ‘mystical’ forms of thought have played a major role in the history of modern philosophy and literature from Hegel to Lukàcs, Heidegger, Bataille, and Derrida, and from Novalis to Paul Celan, Ingeborg Bachmann, Pierre Klossowski, and John Cage (to name just a few). In this course we will read and discuss key texts written by Meister Eckhart, one of the most significant background figures in this tradition. Based on the discussion of his texts, we will look into the ways how Eckhart has been read by 19th and 20th century authors and explore the impact he had on the formation of modern concepts of (and discussions about) subjectivity and agency.  Depending on student interest, other premodern ‘mystical’ texts—e.g. Angela of Foligno’s writings and Georges Bataille’s engagement with them—can be part of the course as well. We will decide on a final version of the syllabus at the first meeting of class.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

V. KahnWhat do we mean by “early modern?” How has the concept of the early modern been constructed? How have twentieth-century theorists and philosophers read early modern texts and with what consequences for contemporary theory? In this course, we will focus on a group of twentieth-century European critics who turned to early modern texts to make sense of the crisis of modernity during the interwar period. Rather than exploring how the early modern period anticipated modern ideas of liberalism, rights, and scientific progress (one standard reading of the period), these critics focused instead on the ways in which the early modern period contributed to a crisis of historicism and secular reason that in turn fueled new forms of political theology, including fascism and totalitarianism, in the twentieth century. Of particular concern to the modern theorists was a constellation of issues that are directly relevant to critical debates today: the meaning of political theology, the relationship between secularism and historicism, and the role of literary culture in the newly secular European nation-states. The moderns we will consider include Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, Alexandre Kojève, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Kantorowicz, Hannah Arendt, Louis Althusser and Etienne Balibar. The early moderns include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Shakespeare, and SpinozaComp Lit 260:1

R. AlterThis course is conceived as an advanced workshop in literary translation, founded on the assumption that the practice of translation is fundamental to the study of literature. Each student should have a semester-long translation project (a collection of poems or stories, part of a novel, a long poem, a memoir, etc.). There are no restrictions as to languages translated or periods from which the texts are taken. Each week the class will discuss samples from two of these projects in progress. The seminar sessions are intended to be collaborative discussions on the problems of literary translation rather than critiques of the work of the translators. We will not be reading translation theory.COMP LIT 260:1

C. KronfeldIn this seminar we will explore developments in the field of translation studies that have taken it beyond the once common metaphors of fidelity and betrayal, of being faithful or unfaithful to the “original.”  We’ll focus on (mis)translations as symptomatic of the poetic and political dynamics of the negotiations between cultures in a particular historical moment. We’ll discuss a variety of approaches to the theory of translation, from system theory to postcolonial and globalization studies, both by reading critically and by theorizing from the translation practice itself. Central issues will include the role of translation in the construction of national and transnational literary histories, (un)equal power relations in the cultural negotiations between source and target text, recovering the role of agency in translation, and translation as intertextual practice.Participants will experiment with collaborative translations of poetry from “their” language(s) and provide a comparative critical analysis of the poetics and politics implicit in influential translation projects in these languages.  The poetry of Yehuda Amichai (1924-2000), translated from the Hebrew, will serve as our anchor, providing both a case study and an alternative theoretical model.  We will read closely Amichai’s last book, Open Closed Open, where he foregrounds translation-work as valorized woman’s-work and offers a meditation on translation as a metonymy for poetry – for the translator/poet’s intertextual wrestling with the authority of the past or her/his struggles against the political and academic “Newspeak” of the present.Guest discussions by local translators and translation scholars.Students will work in small groups and present their translation and critical process to the seminar.  Collaborative oral and written projects will be encouraged.  Seminar paper: an annotated translation project with theoretical and historical introduction.READING LIST: 1)      Lawrence Venutti, The Translation Studies Reader, London& N.Y.:Routledge, 2000.2)      Tejaswini Niranjana, Siting Translation: History, Post-Structuralism, and the Colonial Context, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992.3)      Yehuda Amichai, Open Closed Open, trans.

Michael LuceyIn this seminar we’ll be investigating a number of different topics, all of which will somehow, if we are lucky, meet up by the end of the semester:  What happens when you think of sexuality sociologically, as a set of categories and social forms that circulate through space and time? What happens when you think of literature also as a set of categories and social forms (genres, activities, patterns of response) and a set of works that circulate in particular patterns of their own, and  that produce meaning as much via their interrelations and their endurance in certain institutional contexts as by way of their own signifying?  How and why might sexuality come to be a particular topic of representation and investigation in a given literary field at a given time, and what that might mean, both literarily and sociologically?  How will different literary institutions cope with sexuality in literature? We will focus on literature from France between 1930 and 1970 (in particular texts by Colette, Genet, Leduc, Pinget), and in the course of our study we will consult a wide variety of classic sociological texts (Durkheim, Goffman, Bourdieu), some contemporary ethnographic work on sexuality and some recent work in linguistic anthropology, along with a variety of approaches to the aesthetic (in particular, the literary) object (including Dewey, Adorno,  Bourdieu).One book by Violette Leduc that we will be reading, Mad in Pursuit, is currently out of print, but there are used copies easily available on line, so interested students are encouraged to seek them out.  Other books that will be ordered include:  Colette, The Pure and the Impure, Jean Genet, Our Lady of the Flowers, Leduc, La Bâtarde, Robert Pinget, The Libera Me Domine, John Dewey, Art as Experience, Theodor Adorno, Aesthetic Theory, Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction.Comp Lit 266:1

F. MasielloThis course is also listed as Span 280:2This course is designed to question the conventional critical categories with which we have learned to speak about literature at the close of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth. Instead of reinforcing the oft-stated divisions between naturalism and aestheticism, we will look at the corpus of fin de siglo writing through a different lens in order to probe certain issues that broadly define culture of the times: hence, the ways in which different aesthetic proposals negotiate the transformation of Latin America and Europe from a rural to urban society, and the representation of the body, illness, and criminality as markers of a society in transition. Along with this, we will look at the kinds of literary languages produced in fin de siglo texts in order to produce a disruption of traditional modes of representation, emphasizing performance or masquerade as rituals of modernization. Finally, we will consider the polemics triggered by cultural modernization, including the professionalization of the writer, the marketing of literary phenomena, the “fashion” of aesthetics and literature destined for a leisure class audience, and the creation of an intellectual bohemia as a counter-public sphere. Texts will be drawn from the literatures of the Southern Cone, the Caribbean, and Peru along with several texts from the British and French traditions.This course will be continued in the following year with emphasis on literature at the close of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, but it is not required that you continue; nor will students interested in recent culture be required to take this course as prerequisite for admission to the next one.You need to be fluent in Spanish in order to take this course.  Com Lit 41A

N. CleaverWe tend to think of epic as long and serious, full of noble characters at war with vengeful gods and impossible monsters. It takes place in a “masculine” world, glorifying great men engaged in lofty battles. The subject matter is weighty, following the fate of a single hero who ensures the triumph of a chosen people by destroying all obstacles, human, divine, or monstrous, that stand in the way of that nationalistic destiny.In this course we will question this conventional view of epic. What makes an epic an epic? Can this genre be defined coherently? What do we do with epics that do not fit all or even part of this description? After a brief historical overview of the epic tradition of western Europe, we will read four major epics from four different national traditions in their entirety: Lucan’s Pharsalia, Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, Rabelais’s Gargantua, and Milton’s Paradise Lost.While these are major texts of the epic tradition, in many ways they violate the rules of the genre. What do we make of Lucan’s mutilated bodies as a metaphor for a state ripped apart by its own desire for empire? Where do we place Rabelais’s obscene, extravagant giants and parodies of noble genealogies? What of Ariosto’s women warriors and Satan as the epic hero of Paradise Lost? Do we still consider them epics? How do these disparities affect our ability to define genre? Required Texts: Lucan, The PharsaliaAriosto, The Orlando FuriosoRabelais, GargantuaMilton, Paradise LostAristotle, The PoeticsCritical and Secondary Readings(Selections from these texts will be available in a reader and on the course bSpace site.)Durling, The Figure of the Poet in the Renaissance EpicGiamatti, Earthly Paradise and the Renaissance EpicGreene, The Light in TroyLukács, The Theory of the Novel Quint, Epic and EmpireZatti, The Quest for Epic

Andrea GadberryThis course has two major aims.  First, it will attempt to consider how the novel can work as an ambivalent form or as a form that induces ambivalence.  Second, it will explore the concept of ambivalence more widely through texts whose narrators, characters, and plots engage in the anxiety and melancholia of ambivalence.Our study of the novel will take particular interest in ambivalence’s formal properties both in the subject who experiences ambivalence and in texts that seem to evoke this subjective state through narrative.  As we read these novels, we’ll also look at literary criticism, psychoanalytic works, and philosophical texts and attempt to understand the production of some of ambivalence’s kin: ambiguity, irony, and paradox.  We’ll examine the structure of ambivalent desire and its relationship to the fetish in novels that portray love-hate relationships, sadomasochism, and repressed (contradictory) desires.  Likewise, we’ll read works that help us probe the states that follow ambivalence from resolution and resignation to the “madness of the decision.”  As we ponder the fraught relationship of ambivalence to action, we’ll ask, adapting Simone de Beauvoir’s  terminology, how these novels offer or refuse an “ethics of ambi[valence].”Major assignments may include two papers, several shorter assignments, and one presentation.Required Texts:Djuna Barnes.

T. WarnerIn this class we will consider whether the spread of the novel as a global literary form and of human rights as a political framework might be intertwined.In addition to reading a selection of novels that pertain, in a variety of ways, to the subject of human rights, we will closely study the Declarations of 1789 and 1948. As a class, we will also read essays of critical and political theory that engage with the promises and paradoxes of human rights. Finally, this course will aim to familiarize students with foundational studies of the novel as a genre, in order to develop a vocabulary for discussing and writing about them. We will devote special attention to two sub-genres of the novel, the epistolary novel and the Bildungsroman, which recent scholarly works have attempted to link to the rise and spread of human rights.In the course of our readings, we will explore such questions as: Do novels teach their readers to recognize themselves and others as human? If so, what are the possibilities and limitations of this type of recognition? How do literary models of representation inform legal ones, and vice versa? How have particular novels negotiated the difference between the human, the citizen and other figures? How might certain narrative conventions drawn from novels contribute to the legibility of agency, pain and dignity? What are the stakes of witnessing and what are the limits of empathy? How have works from different moments in time and space laid claim to (and contested) human rights?A course reader will include articles by Giorgio Agamben, Hannah Arendt, Nancy Armstrong, Mikhail Bakhtin, Wendy Brown, Werner Hamacher, Lynn Hunt, György Lukacs, Franco Moretti, DA Miller, Edward Said, Joan Wallach Scott, Joseph Slaughter, Ian Watt, and Slavoj Zizek.Novels may include:Chinua Achebe – Arrow of GodChimamanda Ngozie Adiche – Half of a Yellow SunMariama Bâ – So Long a letterDaniel Defoe – Robinson CrusoeAssia Djebar – L’Amour la fantasiaGustave Flaubert – Sentimental EducationMichael Ondaatje – Anil’s GhostSamuel Richardson – PamelaJose Rizal – Noli Me TangereJean-Jacques Rousseau – JulieNgugi Wa’Thiongo – Weep Not ChildWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

A. GadberryIn this course, we will consider the importance of cruelty to theatre and the various ways in which theatre portrays and defines it.  We will look at plays that have particularly savage acts at their center (or just offstage…), and we will ask ourselves how and why these plays cast cruelty, its victims, and its agents as they do.  In doing so, we’ll consider what it might mean to use this medium in particular to represent cruelty, what the stakes are of allowing the cruel to gaze back into its viewers.   We’ll ask ourselves what the theatre of cruelty can do and how it might (and might not) continue its work into the theatre of the world.  How does theatre modulate, exaggerate, or banalize the cruelty of its protagonists?  How does it handle the victim, the bystander, the “collateral damage” ?  What’s left after the cruel performance; what catharsis from cruelty is available (or not)?  What relationships do these plays forge between the cruelties they portray and the viewer who beholds them?We will read plays across cultures and time periods, and we will examine other primary and secondary texts that concern themselves with both cruelty and theatre — in particular those that worry about real cruelties in the real world — as well as spectacles of punishment and power as we consider the dimensions political, social, and aesthetic of cruelty on stage.Please note:  There will be required screenings of film adaptations of some of the plays we  discuss in class, and there likely will be an excursion to a local theatrical performance.Required Texts:– Aeschylus.  Agamemnon.

Tristram WolffHow do the aims of marriage control the plot of a comedy, and how can comic innovation rewrite the rituals of marriage and divorce? Taking its guiding motives from Stanley Cavell’s study of the 1940s Hollywood screwball comedy (Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage, 1981), this course is an effort to follow through on some of the work’s evasions and loose ends. We’ll do this by considering three distinct forms of comedy (Shakespeare’s plays, classic screwball films, and more briefly Austen’s novels), and by introducing some contemporary deviations from the conventional marriage plot. As a constitutive element of comedy, as well as a critical risk from the Adam and Eve story to the recent rash of reality TV dating shows, the “plot” to perform, consummate or re-enact a marriage represents for narrative both capstone and pitfall. In this course, we will pose questions about the promising “conversational” basis of remarriage, the self-reflective artifice of the genre’s classics, and the manner in which these texts embody, comment on or inflect their social conditions. We will also test the limits of the genre by zeroing in on outdated gender roles and the “threat” of gay marriage. Above all, we will practice reading literary and cinematic texts to question and expand Cavell’s suggestions about the interaction between artistic media, social norms and comic subversion.Texts & FilmsWilliam Shakespeare:• A Midsummer Night’s Dream• Much Ado About Nothing • As You Like It • The Winter’s TaleJane Austen:• Emma (selections)• PersuasionStanley Cavell, Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage•  The Lady Eve (Preston Sturges)• The Palm Beach Story (Preston Sturges)• Bringing Up Baby (Leo McCarey)• The Awful Truth (Leo McCarey)• The Philadelphia Story (George Cukor)• His Girl Friday (Howard Hawks)Additional primary and secondary reading on comedy, marriage and film will likely include selections from the Bible, Milton, Henri Bergson, Johan Huizinga, C.

This is a fraught question; the answer seems everywhere self-evident, for many, yet what is or makes an American is radically contingent. In this course, we will approach the question of who, what, and/or how one is an American by focusing on three discrete historical time periods (settlement and colonization, the consolidation of the U.S. as an independent nation-state, and the late twentieth century) and by attempting to track the encounters of different sorts of people—different sorts of “Americans”—inscribed in narratives, plays, and novels. In the first phase of the class, we will read about and study the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans, how settlement and colonization were mutually catastrophic for colonizers and natives alike, and how representations of captivity contribute to our understanding of colonial (European) subjects and Native American “insurgents.” We will then explore the founding of the American Republic and register the transition from colony to nation, again focusing on the encounter between the newly constituted American citizens and their slaves. Finally, we will investigate the self-consciously multicultural United States of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century by focusing on the encounter between immigrants and sexual minorities—New Americans—with/in the United States and its peoples. Throughout the course, we will complement our understanding of “American” as U.S. citizens with texts from our American cousins from the “South” to help us complicate what it has meant to be an American from within and without the nation. Not only will we challenge and potentially generate new meanings for “American,” we will also engage in a discussion of the reified concepts of race, gender, and ethnicity as they intersect with competing notions of “American.”T/Th 9:30-11:00

M. Bhaumik This class examines the particularity of literature at the margins of the American culture, globalization and governance.  Through a reading of novels, poems, films, short stories and music, we will attempt to unravel a specific condition of disenchantment with the world emerging from the space of the periphery both within and external to the territorial United States.  The class will grapple with the scales of sorrow, sites of mourning, industrial catastrophes, damage, scarcity, loss and transnational dislocation characterizing the relation of psychic and social life to cultural production.  As we read the gripping portrayals of the conditions of possibility for survival at the extremities of the United States, we will engage in discussions about how to conceptualize the particular aesthetic patterns of discontent and despair in relation to the universal proclamations of political treatises on democracy, economic prosperity and programs of world development.  Through a number of critical readings delving into the inequities between center and periphery, development and suffering, global and local, home and the world, students will be encouraged to develop their own formulations of what characterizes your reading of the human condition at America’s periphery.Requirements include weekly responses, oral presentations, mid-term paper and final research project.  Regular participation and attendance are mandatory.Miguel Ángel Asturias, Los ojos de los enterradosMartin Delaney, Blake, Or the Huts of AmericaWilliam Faulkner, SartorisJamaica Kincaid, It’s a Small Place and My BrotherToni Morrison, A MercyManuel Luis Martínez, CrossingTomás Rivera, Y no se lo tragó la tierraIndra Sinha, Animal’s People* Do not buy books until after the first meeting. Films:Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, Memorias del subdesarolloSpike Lee, When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four ActsMahesh Mathai, Bhopal ExpressA reader will include short works from Hannah Arendt, Amilcar Cabral, W.E.B.

Luis RamosThis course takes as its object of reflection a question Gustavo Pérez Firmat nearly two decades ago posed:  Do the Americas share a common literature? That is, do the two Americas, both North and South, mainland and insular, polar and equatorial, share—if not geographic—textual common ground? If so, what similar literary strategies and common critical concerns might such an ensemble of texts bring to the fore? This course takes up these questions from a historical—and materialist—perspective; that is, from one that views history (and by extension, literature) from the violent and traumatic conditions from which they both emerge. In so doing, however, we will not subscribe to a deterministic or defeatist view of either, but rather, to one wherein both emancipation and conquest, resistance and domination, dispossession and regeneration, are accounted for in equal measure. Thus students should expect not only to devise novel strategies of conceiving the relation between literary traditions typically understood as distinct, but moreover, to articulate previously unforeseen ways of thinking about the Americas as an expanded category of aesthetic and geopolitical thought. In keeping with the above aims, the course will be structured into four related units: The meaning of freedom and self-awareness in Anglo American and Latin American republican thought (1); the burden of chattel slavery in Afro Cuban and African American testimonial narrative (2); the legacies of conquest in American Indian and Mayan historical consciousness (3); and finally, the histories of Chinese new world migration in Asian American and Cuban American fiction (4).Required texts:Films:*Course reader including seminal texts in political and critical thought (Jefferson, Bolivar, Emerson, Marti, Arendt, Derrida Saldivar and Hartman) will be available the first day of class.CL 60AC:1,

Enrique Lima(Pending final approval of course from American Cultures Committee)In this course we will examine the development of “the West” as a historical and literary concept. We will investigate its role in the creation of American identities and as a space in which those identities may be contested and refigured.  We will begin with Frederick Jackson Turner’s famous “frontier thesis.” The emptiness of the western frontier, argued Turner, was responsible for fostering the sense of individual responsibility that is at the core of American democracy. We will read Willa Cather’s Death Comes for the Archbishop as a complicated rewriting of the West as the territory of self and national formation. Death Comes illustrates the ways in which the West has been configured as the productive place in which people of European descent become Americans. Unlike Turner, Cather does not empty the West of non-White peoples. She does, however, minimize the conflict that underwrote Western expansion. The effects of that historical process are at the heart of D’Arcy McNickle’s Wind from an Enemy Sky. McNickle’s novel is keenly interested in the effects of colonial subjugation on surviving native communities. The legacies of historical violence, McNickle suggests, continue to shape the lives of Native Americans. Just as conquest created Native America as we know it so too did it create the analogous place of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans as subjects that have been incorporated as external to the nation-state that is their home. Ramón Saldívar’s The Borderlands of Culture, Américo Paredes’ George Washington Gómez, and Helena Viramontes’ Under the Feet of Jesus, one a critical/theoretical work, the other two novels, explore the meaning of the border on people of Mexican descent and on the very fabric of American culture. In the last section of the course we will turn to the history and aesthetics of violence as it relates to the West. Violence, Richard Slotkin argues in Regeneration Through Violence, is not just an Indian or a Mexican problem. Rather, he maintains, violence is one of the spiritual sources of American national identity broadly conceived. The western frontier has been conquered through violence and that violence, at once disavowed and sublimated, remains a determining feature of Americans’ vision of themselves. Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian is a profound and aesthetically dense meditation on the role of frontier violence on American culture. Leslie Marmon Silko’s Almanac of the Dead is another. Almanac refuses to recognize any of the national borders that cut through the West as violent colonial inventions. The West, this course maintains, has a privileged position in the imaginary geography of U.S. nationalism. It has often been configured as the open space of possibility, the place where pure individualism has had the space to explore its limits. But this imaginary geography as the course’s readings will show has just as often come in conflict with the historical West as a colonized territory that continues to be contested by Native Americans, Mexicans, Latinos, and Anglos.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	“If you ask me what I came to do in this world, I, an artist,
will answer you: I am here to live out loud.”—Émile Zola
While literature classes often touch on the relationship between the artist and his or her literary work of art, this class will focus especially on how artists reflect upon themselves as artists through their art. What happens when the subject of a literary work becomes the artist him or herself? This course consists of an exploration of this primary question, which will lead us to interrogate several other more specific aspects about the relationship between the artist and his or her art. How do artists conceive of their relationship to the
societies in which they live and create? How do artists perceive the role of art in society, and how has that understanding influenced the form of their own art?  How does the gender or sexuality of the artist affect the production and reception of his or her art? How is an artist affected by fame once they achieve the status of celebrity? What kinds of tensions arise as an artist strives to be committed to sociopolitical causes? We will explore all of these questions, along with others that arise, as we make our way through the reading and viewing of various novels, stories, poems, films, and philosophical texts that take up the figure of the artist as their primary subject matter. Along the way, we will learn how to engage closely with these texts in order to develop, refine, and defend solid literary arguments.This course is designed to help students develop critical thinking, writing, and oral expression skills that are applicable beyond the domain of literary studies. Students will learn how to develop interesting analytical arguments, incorporate research into their writing, and refine their ideas through the drafting and revision of two essays. Short bCourses posts will also be required in order to help facilitate thinking about the course’s material. Since this is a discussion-based course, a strong emphasis will be placed on active student participation in class.Required Texts:de Staël, Corinne (Oxford)

																	Tales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? How do competing twentieth-century empires (such as those in Japan, China, and Britain) conceive of themselves — and of one another — differently? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.Requirements and Grades5% Diagnostic Essay (2-3 pages)5% Reading Quizzes5% Attendance and Participation10% Paper 1, Version 1 (6-8 pages)15% Paper 1, Version 2 (6-8 pages)10% Performance Project and Written Response5% Final Paper – Annotated Bibliography5% Final Paper – Detailed Outline15% Final Paper, Rough Draft (8-10 pages)25% Final Paper, Final Draft (10-12 pages)Required TextJ.M.

University requirements mandate that every student in an R1B course produce at least one diagnostic paper and two longer essays (with drafts), for a total of 32 pages of writing.However, we are not going to launch straight into a 32-page writing assignment. This course will use a combination of writing workshops, reflective homework assignments, class discussion, and group presentations to build up your critical reading and writing skills. In analyzing a series of provocative and difficult texts, we will develop the critical outlook and vocabulary that will be the root of your final project. By the end of this course, you should feel able to present your own research in a well-organized, 10- to 12-page paper.Writing AssignmentsThis semester, we will be working on honing both your analytical and your research skills. There will be four individual papers. The first is a short sample essay of 2-3 pages. The second is a 6-8 page literary analysis, which will be graded and returned with comments. The third paper will be a revision of your 6-8 page analytical paper. Substantial revisions are mandatory. You should think of the revision as a fresh paper loosely based on your first draft; both the original and the revision will receive entirely separate grades. These papers will serve as a review of what you learned in R1A and will not include research.The final project for this class is your research paper. In late October, you will select a text from the course readings to explore in greater depth; you will then complete an annotated bibliography and outline in November before handing in your rough and final drafts of the paper at the end of the fall term. Each stage of this final project (annotated bibliography, outline, rough draft, and final draft) will receive its own grade. Your rough draft will be 8 to 10 pages; the final version will be 10 to 12 pages long.HomeworkI will assign homework regularly. Assignments will include reading responses and close readings of selected passages from the class’s texts. These assignments will provide an important basis for your papers, and will also help you contribute to class discussion and activities. Periodically, there will be unannounced reading quizzes, so be sure to come thoroughly prepared to each class session.Lateness Policy and ExtensionsPapers must be turned in on time. Your paper grade will be lowered by 1/3 letter grade (B-> B-, B- -> C+, etc.) for each day it is late. It is your responsibility to balance the requirements of this class with those of your other classes. That said, extensions will be granted in extreme circumstances with prior consent. Please keep in touch if you are having trouble completing an assignment! I can discuss arrangements to accept late work if you let me know that you need more time before the paper is due.Attendance and ParticipationAttendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes; roll will be taken every day during this period of both regular and waitlisted students. Anyone who does not attend all classes during the first two weeks will be dropped from the class. During the second week of classes, students will be added from the waitlist, and no students may be added after the second week of the term without permission from the Department. Over the course of the semester, you are granted 2 unexcused absences without penalty; all other absences required advance notice and adequate excuse (e.g., a doctor’s note). 3 late arrivals to class will equal one unexcused absence. Your grade will automatically be lowered 1% for each additional unexcused absence.Participation is a vital part of this course. While there will be occasional lectures and presentations, your active participation is a key component to the success of the class. Please come to class prepared to share observations and questions on the texts we encounter.PlagiarismThe University has a strict policy on plagiarism, which is a violation of Berkeley’s Honor Code:“Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example:• Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without acknowledgment.• Use of the views, opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment.• Paraphrasing of another person’s characteristic or original phraseology, metaphor or other literary device without acknowledgment.”From the Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct from the Center for Student Conduct – more information is available at http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct.No plagiarism of any kind will be tolerated in this class.

																	This course will trace the legacy of an American genre, the horror story, from the nineteenth century to the present.We begin with famous writers of the American Renaissance (Hawthorne, Irving, Poe) and inquire about why the horrors of Dark Romanticism are at the very roots of American literary culture. What is it about the cultural and physical landscape of nineteenth-century United States that makes it so fertile for the writing of horror? In what ways are the horrors of nineteenth-century American history (slavery, settler colonialism, empire) registered and represented in Gothic and supernatural stories, and in what ways do they remain merely “specters”? What can the horror story of the nineteenth century teach us about racial dynamics then and in the present?We then move to the Hollywood classics of horror cinema and evaluate the horror film’s capacity to interrogate (or, at times, perpetuate) American social ills. Our task is to analyze how classic horror films represent gendered power dynamics, make manifest repressed sexual desire, lampoon cultures of consumerism and suburbanization, and examine (and/or deploy) the fear of racial, ethnic, or national Others.In the second part of the course, we will consider the plurality of cultural histories and identities to which the horror genre gives voice. We will read fiction and watch films by Indigenous, Black, Chicano and Asian American authors and filmmakers that represent histories of immigration, displacement, discrimination, and social and economic marginalization. We will consider not only how these works respond to historical and social realities, but also how they critically retool the horror genre as a means of enriching social imaginaries.Possible Texts Include:Washington Irving, “The Devil and Tom Walker”Stephen Vincent Benét, “The Devil and Daniel Webster”Nathanial Hawthorne, “Young Goodman Brown”Edgar Allen Poe, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (excerpts)Merien C.

																	Who are America’s heroes? Are they caped crusaders and cowboys, or are they of a more ordinary sort – oddball schoolmasters like Ichabod Crane and country lawyers like Atticus Finch? In this class, we’ll explore the question of American (both Northern and Southern) heroism by asking whether, how, and why America looked (or perhaps needed?) to create heroes that were different from the chivalric knights and epic warriors – including the Vikings that reached America – of the Old World(s).To explore these questions, we’ll consider a wide variety of heroes – from cross-dressing conquistadors to female Korean revolutionaries, wanna-be cowboys to comic book superheroes – as well as their broad range of fans – from Holocaust survivors to a first-generation Dominican American teen. With an eye toward contemporary American popular culture, we’ll also think about why in the last decade we’ve seen the simultaneous rise of the Anti-Hero in cable television (The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Dexter, etc.) along with the return of comic book Superheroes in film (The Dark Knight, The Avengers, etc.).From a cultural perspective, we’ll ask how heroes reflect and respond to society’s values and anxieties, as shaped by politics, race, and gender. Do heroes operate within society’s bounds of convention and authority (perhaps even reifying social norms and hierarchies) or are they, as they often portray themselves to be, defenders of the downtrodden, perhaps even figures with revolutionary social potential? With such questions in mind, our exploration of heroism will be placed within larger questions of “myth-making” and “mythologies” that seek to ask how America (or the Americas) understands itself, its past, and its future. If a hero can function as a symbol of cultural or national unity, can heroism also tell us about the divisions within American society, be it the divide between indigenous Amerindian populations and later settlers, the north/south split(s), or divisions of class, race and ethnicity?Our exploration of such topics and questions will lead us to consider both major literary texts and films as well as comics, graphic novels, and television episodes, either in their entirety or excerpted. We will have a course reader with shorter texts and theoretical essays; major texts may be selected from among the following:Literature –The Vinland Sagas, The Norse Discovery of America: “Graenlendinga Saga” and “Eirik’s Saga”Catalina de Erauso: Lieutenant Nun: Memoir of a Basque Transvestite in the New WorldWashington Irving:  The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Other Stories American Indian Myths and Legends (edited by Richard Erdoes and Alfonso Ortiz)Mark Twain:  Pudd’nhead Wilson and Those Extraordinary TwinsTeresa Hak Kyung Cha:  DictéeMichael Chabon:  The Adventures of Kavalier and ClayJunot Diaz:  The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar WaoFilm and Television –The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence The SearchersHigh NoonTo Kill a Mockingbird (plus excerpts from the novel)O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Rather than asking after the fate of the ancients, the works we will analyze beg us to ask a different question: what is the fate of the contemporary?In this course we will consider how and why (mostly) twentieth- and twenty-first-century Greek and Italian authors and artists produce an aesthetic of the “archaic” in the “contemporary” moment. We will discuss questions of aesthetic form, linguistic and cultural translation, time and temporality, and the relationship between copies and originals through the analysis of gestures, landscapes, ruins, sculptures, tragic narratives, and poetic forms in various media.This is a writing intensive R1B course with a research component. A substantial amount of time will be devoted to writing workshops and instruction. Students will be required to write papers with revisions.Texts may include:Homer, Odyssey (selections)

																	In this course, we will look at the relationship between architecture and literature primarily through two different prepositions: first, in literature, as in the presence of the built environment, such as houses, buildings, roads, etc., in many different texts; second, of literature, as in the different structural forms of a variety of genres. What is the shape or space of the novel? How is a poem built—and how does it construct meaning? Naturally, we will also consider the two—in and of—together and examine ways in which they influence each other; how, for example, different forms of architecture have impacted different generic practices, and vice versa. Our readings take us from ancient Greece through the Paris of the 19th and 20th Century, from Virginia Woolf’s London to J.G. Ballard’s High-Rise. As this is an R1B class, writing is an essential component. In weekly workshops, students will have the opportunity to work on idea development, argumentative skills, and revision in smaller formats, with the semester’s efforts culminating in a 10-page research paper and its subsequent revision.COURSE OVERVIEW:There are 2 long papers required for this class, as well as revisionary work on those papers. There will be many smaller, less-pressure writing assignments along the way, as well as a focus on individual attention in office hours (which are a requirement!). Participation is also required, & if you generally have trouble speaking in class, please be sure to see us within the first two weeks so we can talk about ways (smaller groups, one-on-one appointments, etc.) to get you talking!REQUIRED TEXTS:Antigone, SophoclesMrs. Dalloway, Virginia WoolfHigh Rise, JG BallardDora Bruder, Patrick ModianoCourse Reader FILMS:Sans Soleil, Chris MarkerWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Our readings and viewings this semester follow authors, artists, activists, and fictional protagonists as they navigate borders between places, nations, times, and identities. Scenes and sites of various fault lines that we will visit in this course include: The expulsion from paradise in Genesis. The Trans-Siberian Railroad. The walls of the old city in Jerusalem. We encounter two lovers in Hiroshima, a contemporary author trying to recuperate the memory of a girl who disappeared during the German occupation of Paris, an Arab shepherd searching for his goat on Mount Zion, and a German artist collective that collides the memory of the Berlin Wall with the current borders of “Fortress Europe.” All these moments that negotiate different kinds of borders and barriers confront us, however, not only with structures of separation but also with their disruption. As different times, places, and identities collide and collapse into each other, the literary texts and artworks turn into sites that unsettle the way we read, think, and remember.Considering literature’s fault lines is not only a matter of content. We will also investigate formal techniques of fragmentation, gaps in the literary accounts, and interrupted narrations that challenge us to consider not only the way art talks about borders but also the multiple ways in which it enacts, creates, or breaks them down itself.As this is an R1B class, writing is an essential component. In weekly workshops, students will have the opportunity to work on idea development, argumentative skills, and revision in smaller formats, with the semester’s efforts culminating in a 10-page research paper and its subsequent revision.

																	If, as Judith Butler suggests, “to desire is to err, but to err necessarily,” how can we tell when desire is a necessary, productive deviation from the norm, and when it becomes a dangerous, counter-productive force? In this course, we will explore the uneasy relationship between desire and the “erring” away from, or transgression of national, social, cultural, and sexual boundaries. How do we distinguish between “healthy” or “normal” desire and “deviant” or “abnormal” desire? Is it possible to err too far if we desire too strongly? In what ways does desire dictate the formation of the boundaries of one’s own self?We will study the ways in which desire drives narrative plot, both illuminates and obscures language and the creation of meaning, and challenges traditional constructions of politics, identity, community, gender and sexuality. We will also turn to critical theories of desire to examine the interplay between notions of socio-cultural transgression and literary transgression – in what ways is desire encoded, mediated, and produced in the literary text and how might the text itself engage in acts of transgression?This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, one short diagnostic essay and two longer analytical research papers.

R. KaufmanCOURSE DESCRIPTION: About 2/3 or 3/4 of this seminar will involve sustained reading and discussion of Theodor W. Adorno’s last major work, which he was still finishing at the time of his 1969 death: Aesthetic Theory (1970). Prerequisites for Enrollment: Significant familiarity with the following major texts of philosophy, aesthetics, sociopolitical and/or critical theory (for the longer texts, familiarity with at least key excerpts is sufficient) to which Aesthetic Theory offers sustained and repeated yet often extraordinarily compressed responses, on the assumption that Aesthetic Theory‘s readers are aware not only of these earlier texts (and key concepts and phenomena at issue within them, such as: the status of objective conceptuality and aesthetic non- or quasi-conceptuality; the constellation and force-field; use-value, exchange value, mechanical/technical/technological reproduction’s values over against aesthetic value; determinant and reflective judgment; commitment/engagement; mass, popular, and conceptually undetermined culture; relations among subjectivity, critical agency, class consciousness; etc.), but are also aware of something of the texts’ complicated reception histories: Major Texts with which enrollees should be familiar: Kant, Critique of Judgment; Hegel, Lectures on the Fine Arts, Phenomenology of Spirit; Marx, Theses on Feuerbach, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, Das Kapital (esp. chapter-section “The Secret of Commodity Fetishism”); Marx and Engels, The German Ideology; The Communist Manifesto; Walter Benjamin, “One-Way Street,” “The Storyteller,” “Surrealism,” “The Author as Producer,” “Conversations with Brecht,” “The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility [Mechanical Reproduction]”; “The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire”; “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire”; “On the Concept of History [Theses on the Philosophy of History]”; Adorno and/or Adorno and Horkheimer: Dialectic of Enlightenment; “On Lyric Poetry and Society”; “Cultural Criticism and Society”; “Commitment [Engagement]”; “The Essay as Form”; “Parataxis”; Minima Moralia.Finally, those wishing to enroll, while not needing to feel themselves already well-versed in the following artistic movements and artists, should nonetheless have some working sense of their importance and sequencing for and within the 19th and 20th-century history of literature (poetry, prose fiction, theatre, criticism), visual art (painting, engraving and print-making, sculpture, criticism), music (chamber, symphonic, operatic, music hall and music theater, jazz, pop; music criticism, etc.), and photography and cinema (and their criticism):Movements/currents/styles/periods including Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Impressionism, Modernism, Dada, Avant-Gardism, New Objectivity; Surrealism, Expressionism, Constructivism, Social/Socialist Realism, Existentialism; Postmodernism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism;Artists including Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Hölderlin, Shelley, Byron, Dickens, Robert Browning, Swinburne, Mörike, Rilke, George, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Zola, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Ibsen, Strindberg, Eliot, Pound, Williams, the Surrealist poets, novelists, and playwrights, Brecht, Lorca, Sartre, Joyce, Beckett, Celan, Bach, Haydn,. Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wagner, Berg, Webern, Schönberg, Weill, Eisler, Boulez, Cage, Stockhausen, Goya, David, Ingres, Delacroix, Gericault, Courbet, Manet, Cezanne, Monet, Picasso, Braque, Grosz, Gris, Léger, Pollock, Kline, Rothko, Guston.Course Proceedings: About the first 1/4 or possibly 1/3 of the seminar will be devoted to very brisk review of the earlier texts mentioned above (starting with the Kant and going all the way through writings by Adorno and his Frankfurt School colleagues) including both their conceptual and historical arguments and contributions, and to rapid recounting of the aesthetic, political, and social tensions they stage and rehearse about movements, artists, critics, philosophers and theorists. This review, which will assume enrolled students’ previous (prior to this seminar) encounters with the texts concerned, will not take time for close reading. The major part of the seminar–our close, careful reading of Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory (1970)–will then seek to understand, interpret, and respond to the text’s treatments of modern art’s development in relation to mostly Kantian, Hegelian, Marxian, and earlier Frankfurt Critical Theory traditions of aesthetics and critical theory. We’ll pay ongoing attention to how and why the imaginative, potentially intersubjective activity traditionally understood to be at the heart of aesthetic experience turns out, with various twists, to be crucial to Adorno’s overall analyses of modernity, mechanical/technical/technological reproduction and reproducibility (in both the economic and artistic-aesthetic spheres), and critical agency. We’ll also consider how Aesthetic Theory‘s concerns and legacies might engage the changed sociopolitical circumstances–and the changed artistic-aesthetic, critical-theoretical tendencies­-of the last three decades. Among the seminar’s emphases will be an ongoing inquiry into how attention to artworks’ formal, stylistic, and philosophical-theoretical dynamics (that is, how–and to what degree–artistic technique, in relation to aesthetic form and aesthetic experience) may offer stimulus toward and insight into historical, sociopolitical, and ethical understanding and engagement.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

R.

Though our readings will engage various arts and cultural practices, they will emphasize literary art. The classic texts we’ll read will include writings by Kant, Hegel, Marx and Engels, Luxemburg, Lukács, Du Bois, Brecht, Benjamin, Adorno, Horkheimer, Sartre, Beauvoir, Raymond Williams, and Jameson. Time permitting, we’ll also try to look briefly at (or at least gesture toward) aesthetics-focused texts by Percy Shelley, Heine, Lenin, Trotsky, Gramsci, Korsch, Mariátegui, Kracauer, Bloch, Marcuse, and Althusser.

Professor Gretchen HeadGateway Course for work in the Comparative Literature Major.
The influence of The 1001 Nights on Western literature has been so widespread that, outside of the Bible, it has no rival from the literature of the Near in the world literary imagination. Jorge Luis Borges once said that the Nights, “is a book so vast that it is not necessary to have read it.” Yet, only by reading the original Arabic story collection of the Nights, taken from Indian and Persian sources, can we reach an understanding of how this story collection has come to play such a decisive role in both Arab and Western cultural spheres since the eighteenth century. This class will examine the core stories of the Nights based on Medieval Arabic manuscripts and the history of the Nights’ translation, reception, and large-scale appropriation by the West from the eighteenth century onward. We will look at the Nights’ narrative structure, often a source of innovation for later authors, while simultaneously examining how the stories have often served to reinforce colonial and neocolonial projects. We will likewise consider how the figure of the Nights’ famous storyteller, Shahrazad, has paradoxically been the subject of appropriation by both Western Orientalists and Arab feminists. We will work across different media and genres, with texts, images, theater, and film, to understand the Nights and its influence in the most far reaching sense. Texts will include the translation of Muhsin Mahdi’s edited fourteenth century Syrian manuscript, excerpts from Edward Lane’s and Richard Burton’s translations, and both Eastern and Western works fundamentally influenced by the Nights, among them: Edgar Allen Poe, Salman Rushdie, Jorge Luis Borges, Naguib Mahfouz, and Voltaire.

Professor Francine MasielloGateway Course for work in the Comparative Literature Major.This course is designed to explore foundational narratives of the Americas in the 19th century. We will look at the ways in which the great masters of prose –Cooper, Melville, and Stowe in the United States and Sarmiento, Gómez de Avellaneda, Gorriti, and Matto de Turner  in Latin America–imagined the conflicts of the emerging liberal republic.  In this context, the representation of the North/South divide and the fictions of nation, race, and gender will be important for our discussions as will the inquiry into the nature of comparative work . Our work will be supported by a study of the legacy of romanticism, the status of underlying philosophical inquiry in the early 19th century (both north and south), and the proposals for understanding the split between “civilization and barbarism” that dominated 19th century political and cultural discourses. Travel discourse, the representation of nature, and the formation of modern subjectivities will also be brought into discussion. Finally, we will address the advantages of comparative study and reading across the grain.Readings will be available in both English and Spanish.Required texts:Cooper, James Fenimore.

R. KaufmanThis seminar takes up a very big question as a way to begin exploring what comparative literary study is:  How do American poets, from about 1950 to the present, attempt formally and thematically to engage ethics and politics? An otherwise impossibly large field of inquiry will be delimited by our emphasis on something at the heart of this seminar’s status as a gateway or introduction to the Comparative Literature major: the process and experience of comparison itself. For while there would be many perspectives from which to approach American poetry’s ethical-political commitments during the last five decades, this particular seminar will focus on the ways that later-modernist and contemporary American poetry (mostly U.S., but with some attention to Latin American, Caribbean, and Canadian texts) have frequently sought to broach ethics and politics through a very specific dialogue: a dialogue with post-World War II German poetry and poetics. Most specifically, we will consider the powerful, extraordinarily influential, and very difficult work of the German-language poet Paul Celan (1920-1970) (often called one of Europe’s greatest poets–perhaps its greatest–since 1945). Born and raised in Romania (but with German as a foundational language of not a mother-tongue), interned in a Romanian-fascist labor camp during the war, Celan–having lost his parents to the Holocaust–lived most of his postwar life in France. Because Celan composed almost all his most significant poems in German, not the least difficult issue confronting him was how to write  poetry in the very language in which the Nazi genocide had just been carried out. His grapplings with that and related problems–and his astonishing development of unprecedented formal means of artistic expression (not least, a severely attenuated lyric musicality nonetheless breathtaking in its virtuosity and beauty) that could begin to do justice to his given materials (those materials stemming from and related to “what has happened,” as Celan sometimes referred to the Holocaust)–led to the creation of a remarkable body of poetry that broke new ground while holding on to much in the history of lyric poetry.We will spend the first few weeks of the seminar considering Celan’s work (and, briefly, that of kindred post-World War II German and European poets, filmmakers, critics, and philosophers); we will then spend the bulk of the seminar seeing how American poetry and poetics, starting in the mid-1950s, attempts to understand what Celan is doing in poetry and what he is asking postwar poetry to attempt. Among our questions–which we will see various American poets likewise posing–will be the degree to which Celan proves translatable (in the literal sense of the translation of his poems into English, Spanish, Portuguese, etc.; and in the metaphorical sense of attempted translations of his poetics, aesthetics, and ethics to American contexts that will involve, among other things, the concerns and claims of the civil rights, feminist, and anti-war movements–and we will perhaps see this questioning above all in terms of American poets’ thinking, in their poetry and criticism, about what is shared and what is different in the historical experiences of European anti-semitism and New World slavery and racism: their thinking, in short, about what in Celan’s pathbreaking poetry in the wake of European fascism and genocide can, and cannot, help them as their artistic work develops its own relationships to pressing ethical and political matters). Throughout the course, these questions will help us pursue and develop our inquiry into what comparative literature and comparative literary study are.(Additional Note: All texts originally written in German, Spanish, Portuguese, etc., will be read in, and our discussions will be based on, English translations; but we will almost always also have available, in facing-page editions or xeroxes/photocopies, the original-language text for reference and comparison. Students will not be required to read German–or Spanish or Portuguese or French–though ability  to read in those languages will of course add greatly to students’ encounters with the poems and translations originally made in those languages.)We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Karl BrittoIn this course we will consider a variety of written and cinematic texts, largely produced in the last decades of the twentieth century, all of which foreground the movement of individuals or communities across national borders. Over the course of the semester, we will discuss a number of interrelated questions: how do contemporary writers attempt to come to terms with the profound historical ruptures and geographic displacements brought about by the experience of transnational movement? How do they seek to render into language and narrative the confusion of conflicting cultural structures, and in what ways are their characters defined and deformed by their status as immigrants? How do these authors represent immigrant bodies as objects that circulate within transnational circuits, variously commodified, eroticized, or pathologized? How are the categories of gender and sexuality inflected by histories of migration? In our discussions, we will consider the specificity of each text while remaining open to insights made possible by reading comparatively. In other words, our goal will not be to synthesize a monolithic theory of “dislocated” literature but rather to analyze individual texts while attempting to be attentive to common textual strategies, formal elements, and practices of representation.

Professor Anne NesbetIn this class we will take a close and multi-faceted look at books written primarily for children, a category of literature that remains rather under-examined, despite its popularity, persistence, and influence. We will read examples of stories for children written in a number of different times (from the 18th places (Europe, Britain, North America), and our readings will make use of many different kinds of literary analysis: historical contextualization, analyses that draw on particular literary theories, psychoanalytical approaches, and close readings. We will also pay some attention to the development of the children’s literature industry in the United States and the ins and outs of children’s publishing today. Readings will include, on the one hand, stories by writers like the Brothers Grimm, Carlo Collodi, Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, Tove Jansson, Madeleine L’Engle, and E. B. White, and, on the other hand, Propp, Freud, Bettelheim, Derrida, Foucault, Genette, and Garber. The instructor is the author of three novels for children: The Cabinet of Earths, A Box of Gargoyles, and The Wrinkled Crown, all published by HarperCollins.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Karl BrittoIn this course, we will approach the work of comparison by examining a number of texts by authors from Africa and the Caribbean, all written in self-conscious relationship to earlier works from the European canon. In what ways—and to what ends—do authors rework, reimagine, and rewrite canonical literature? How are similar stories, characters, and narrative structures transformed by authors writing from different historical, cultural, and geographic locations? What dynamics of power are revealed when postcolonial perspectives are brought to bear upon European texts? We will address these questions and others as we hone our skills in comparative analysis. Please note: because electronic devices make interesting conversation difficult, students are asked to come to class with paper books. Texts to be considered include:Shakespeare, The Tempest (Signet Classics)

[PLEASE NOTE: This “introduction or gateway to the advanced study at the core of the comparative literature major” is expressly designed for students in, entering, or intending to enter the Comparative Literature Department’s major and/or students majoring in other literature departments, or in closely related areas within the humanities.  This seminar is UNSUITABLE FOR STUDENTS OUTSIDE THE COMPARATIVE LITERATURE MAJOR AND/OR CLOSELY RELATED LITERARY/HUMANITIES MAJORS due to the seminar’s intense literary and literary-critical specificity; it is NOT designed to meet the needs of students seeking to satisfy either general or area requirements of the University or of the College of Letters and Science.]
This seminar takes up a very big question as a way to begin exploring what comparative literary study is:  How do American poets, from about 1950 to the present, attempt formally and thematically to engage ethics and politics? An otherwise impossibly large field of inquiry will be delimited by our emphasis on something at the heart of this seminar’s status as a gateway or introduction to the advanced work undertaken in the Comparative Literature major: the process and experience of comparison itself. For while there would be many perspectives from which to approach American poetry’s ethical-political commitments during the last five decades, this particular seminar will focus on the ways that later-modernist and contemporary American poetry (mostly U.S., but with some attention to Latin American, Caribbean, and Canadian texts) have frequently sought to broach ethics and politics through a very specific dialogue: a dialogue with post-World War II German poetry and poetics. Most specifically, we will consider the powerful, extraordinarily influential, and very difficult work of the German-language poet Paul Celan (1920-1970) (often called one of Europe’s greatest poets–-perhaps its greatest–-since 1945). Born and raised in Romania (but with German as a foundational language if not a mother-tongue), interned in a Romanian-fascist labor camp during the war, Celan–-having lost his parents to the Holocaust–-lived most of his postwar life in France. Because Celan composed almost all his most significant poems in German, not the least difficult issue confronting him was how to write poetry in the very language in which the Nazi genocide had just been carried out. His grapplings with that and related problems–-and his astonishing development of unprecedented formal means of artistic expression (not least, a severely attenuated lyric musicality nonetheless breathtaking in its virtuosity and beauty) that could begin to do justice to his given materials (those materials stemming from and related to “what has happened,” as Celan sometimes referred to the Holocaust)–-led to the creation of a remarkable body of poetry that broke new ground while holding on to much in the history of lyric poetry.We will spend the first few weeks of the seminar considering Celan’s work (and, briefly, that of kindred post-World War II German and European poets, filmmakers, critics, and philosophers); we will then spend the rest of the seminar seeing how American poetry and poetics, starting in the mid-1950s, attempts to understand what Celan is doing in poetry and what he is asking postwar poetry to attempt. Among our questions–-which we will see various American poets likewise posing–-will be the degree to which Celan proves translatable (in the literal sense of the translation of his poems into English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc.; and in the metaphorical sense of attempted translations of his poetics, aesthetics, and ethics to American contexts that will involve, among other things, the concerns and claims of the civil rights, anti-colonialist, feminist, and anti-war movements–-and we will perhaps see this questioning above all in terms of American poets’ thinking, in their poetry and criticism, about what is shared and what is different in the historical experiences of European anti-semitism and New World slavery and racism: their thinking, in short, about what in Celan’s pathbreaking poetry in the wake of European fascism and genocide can, and cannot, help them as their artistic work develops its own relationships to pressing ethical and political matters). Throughout the course, these questions will help us pursue and develop our inquiry into just what comparative literature and comparative literary study are.(Additional Note: All texts originally written in German, French, Spanish, etc., will be read in, and our discussions will be based on, English translations; but we will almost always also have available, in facing-page editions or xeroxes/photocopies/PDFs, the original-language text for reference and comparison. Students will not be required to read German–-or French or Spanish–-though ability to read in those languages will of course add greatly to students’ encounters with the poems and translations originally made in those languages.)

Harsha Ram Course Description: What is a hero? What are the origins of the hero as a cultural and literary construct? Originating in myth, the folktale and religious cult-worship, the hero is also present in most literary genres as a central protagonist who acts or is acted upon, and around whom the plot generally revolves. Literary genres determine the kind of heroes that arise, their internal traits and their mode of being in and acting upon the world. This semester we will be examining various types of heroes as they relate to their fictional worlds and to the genres they inhabit: the mythic hero, the tragic hero, the epic hero, the hero of romance, and variants of the romantic hero such as the Gothic and the Byronic. We will be reading extensive literary criticism and some literary and philosophical theory, from Joseph Campbell and Northrop Frye to Hegel, Kojève, and Bakhtin. We will be examining different approaches to literary texts, from traditional historical philology to structuralism, philosophical criticism, and feminism. The course can also be read as a survey of certain aspects of the Western tradition from ancient Greek myth and tragedy, via Milton’s epic, down to nineteenth-century British and Russian romanticism. Throughout the semester we will be following on the heels of the hero Prometheus – rebel and trickster, the stealer of fire and mentor to the human race. Prometheus is the prototypical hero, embodying the collision between human creativity and freedom and the constraints of a social or divine order. He has surfaced at different moments in Western history, from archaic Greece to Athenian democracy to modern Europe in the wake of the French Revolution. The crisis of the Promethean hero delineated by the European romantics allows us to ask what kind of hero – or antihero – is still possible in modern literature.SyllabusBooks to be purchased at the Student Bookstore:Hesiod, Theogony, trans.

Professor Eric NaimanIn this course we will analytically and self-reflexively explore the genre of the academic or campus novel in its historical development and contemporary permutations. How have campus novels evolved and what can they tell us about our own anxieties and desires for academic experience? Although most of the texts we read will deal with the university campus, we will also look at some other settings, including the nursery school, boarding school and independent study. Texts will be chosen from works by Owen Johnson, Enid Blyton, Kingley Amis, David Lodge, Vladimir Nabokov, Muriel Spark, Shirley Jackson, Barry McCrae, Mary McCarthy, Gustave Flaubert, Zadie Smith, Shirley Jackson Jane Gallop and Jeffrey Eugenides.  Critical reading 2 papers, several shorter writing assignments.  Lots of reading, much of it enjoyable and all of it educational.Reading List1.Owen Johnson.

L. KurkeComp. Lit. 100 is designed to present students with texts from various genres and historicial periods, to introduce them to the methods of comparative study. Students are expected to have some competence in at least one foreign language and to be acquainted with the rudiments of literary analysis. The thematic focus of this course will be crises of patrilinearity—family romances gone sour. More specifically, we will be looking at how such family crises enable and generate narratives, but also perturb them; how subjects are constituted and deconstructed through descent groups; how the crisis of patrilinearity can become an emblem in literary texts for other cultural crises; and how this theme intersects with the issues of gender and race. Course requirements include three short writing assignments and a final paper based on an oral presentation of a text chosen by the student and read outside of class.Our reading will embrace both literary texts and theoretical/critical discussions of them.

Prof. BrittoIn this course we will consider a variety of written and cinematic texts, largely produced in the last decades of the twentieth century, all of which foreground the movement of individuals or communities across national borders.  Over the course of the semester, we will discuss a number of interrelated questions: how do contemporary immigrant writers attempt to come to terms with the profound historical ruptures and geographic displacements brought about by the experience of transnational movement?  How do they seek to render into language and narrative the confusion of conflicting cultural structures, and in what ways are their characters defined and deformed by their status as immigrants?  How do these authors represent immigrant bodies as objects that circulate within transnational circuits, variously commodified, eroticized, or pathologized?  How are the categories of gender and sexuality inflected by histories of migration?  In our discussions, we will consider the specificity of each text while remaining open to insights made possible by reading comparatively.  In other words, our goal will not be to synthesize a monolithic theory of immigrant literature but rather to analyze individual texts while attempting to be attentive to common textual strategies, formal elements, and practices of representation.  Readings are subject to change, but will likely include Agha Shahid Ali, selected poetry; Azouz Begag, Shantytown Kid; Edwidge Danticat, Breath, Eyes, Memory; Fatou Diome, The Belly of the Atlantic; Jamaica Kincaid, Lucy; le thi diem thuy, The Gangster We Are All Looking For; Ousmane Sembène, “The Promised Land”/La Noire de…; Leïla Sebbar, Sherazade; Stephen Frears, dir., Dirty Pretty Things.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Frank BeznerWhat does it imply to ‘say I’ in a literary work? In this course we will study the construction of the self in Western literature (Ancient to Modern) across a variety of epochs, genres, and authors, ranging from the earliest texts in which protagonists tell about themselves (Homer, Odyssey) via foundational autobiographical texts as Augustine (Confessions), Rousseau (Confessions), or Nabokov (Speak Memory) to more complex constructions where author and character are identical, but situated in a clearly fictional realm.Key questions that will interest us include the relationship between self-narratives and literary genres or typical plots; the differences between inventing and disclosing a self; the tensions between memory/imagination and ‘truth’; the rhetorics of authenticity; the social, political, and cultural conditions that create the epistemic space for an ‘inner self’ to be revealed.We will also read some seminal texts from the theoretical literature on the self (M. Foucault; J. Butler) and use S. Smith/J. Watson (eds.), Reading Autobiography. A Guide for Interpreting Life Narratives.All texts will be read in English translation, but students are encouraged to study the works written in ‘their’ language(s) in the original. Most theoretical texts will be made available via bspace.Course requirements: two to three papers; active participation in class; keeping a reading journal; final exam.

A. FrancoisHow do literary and filmic texts simultaneously disclose and keep their secrets? This course examines the role of secrets in producing and blocking narrative movement. Particular attention is given to secrets such as the gay closet or racial passing that hide “in plain sight,” as Poe’s “purloined letter” does.  In comparing tragedies, films, case histories, novels, and short stories, we discuss the role of narrative and confessional acts in the construction, circulation and concealment of public and private identities, marked and unmarked by gender, sexual identity, race, or class. We also critically examine the implied analogies between interpretation and detective work, and between reading and religious election. What distinguishes interpretive “insight” from naïve reading?

K. KurkeThis course will study sexuality and gender in two very different historical periods–ancient Greece and 19th-century Europe.  Sexuality will be defined as including sexual acts (e.g. sodomy, pederasty, masturbation); sexual identities (e.g. erastes and eromenos); and sexual systems (e.g. kinship structures, subcultures, political hierarchies).  Readings and lectures will focus on situating queer sexualities relative to dominant organizations of sex and gender.  Topics will include Greek democracy and male homosexuality; the biology of sexual difference; the politics of sodomy; “romantic” friendship between women and men; and the emergence of strictly defined homosexual and heterosexual identities.  We will read literary texts along with historical documents and critical essays to constitute a comparative analysis of ancient Greek and 19th-century European systems of gender and sexuality.Authors to be read include Hesiod, Sappho, Aeschylus, Plato, Wilde, Freud, and Foucault.There will be two papers and a final exam.  There will also be required weekly reading questions that will count towards your final grade.CL 151:1

Professor Niklaus LargierThis course will examine the culture of medieval Germany in a European context through representative examples of its most important literary genres, romance and poetry. The courtly romance and poetry emerged in the last third of the twelfth century in France. It became popular throughout Europe and its influence has been constant in the western literary tradition ever since. The primary goal of the course will be to acquire a general understanding of the poetics, the rhetoric, and the ideological motifs of these texts. Students will enhance their knowledge of the literary landscape in the Middle Ages. Readings will include Hartmann von Aue’s Iwein, Wolfram of Eschenbach’s Parzival, and a selection of Minnesong poems. Special emphasis will be given to the discussion of the languages of emotions and passions, i.e. how expressions of affect are constructed and handled within the texts and how specific configurations of emotions and passions are negotiated. In addition to that we will consider the ways in which the world of medieval romances and epics has been perceived by modern film and opera.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Nicklaus LargierThis course will offer an overview of the fundamentals of irony and its theoretization from Socrates to the present day. We will examine the history of irony in all its permutations, as well as the various positions irony occupies within rhetoric, ontology, aesthetics, politics, and literary theory. Above all, we will ask the question of why the seemingly simple matter of irony proves to be such a tenacious problem in Western thought, and why it continues to be a topic of debate and controversy (including repeated calls for and announcements of its “end”) up to today. Readings will include works by Plato, Schlegel, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Baudelaire, Benjamin, de Man, Deleuze, Derrida, Rorty, and Butler, as well as literary texts by Flaubert, Walser, Mann, and others.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Frank BeznerIn this course we will read a number of seminal texts from one of the most innovative, multi-dimensional, aesthetically complex, and lasting literary traditions in the European Middle Ages: the literature on love (or, as often, but misleadingly labeled, “courtly love”).  Exploring this rich tradition via different genres, we will read vernacular and Latin lyrics (e.g. Troubadour poetry, German Minnesang and Carmina Burana); vernacular romances (e.g. Lancelot, Erec, and Tristan); and theoretical or more experimental treatises on love (Dante).  In reading and comparing these texts we will
•    engage in literary analysis (form, imagery, recurrent elements, principal ideas, beginnings / ends, construction of a speaker/’I’, performance), and the rhetorics of love;
•    discuss questions of gender and emotionality implied in our texts
•    explore the intersections of love literature and other discourses (medical, theological, legal) and discuss the relationship between our texts and the complex intellectual and social milieus in which they originated;
•    discuss a number of scholarly approaches to the problem.
As no familiarity with medieval literature is required, we will discuss a number of basic aspects of medieval literary culture, among them: concepts of authorship, literary institutions, manuscripts, and the performance of literature. In consequence, the course can also be attended as an introduction into medieval literature.There will be some lecturing, but most classes will consist of close-readings and discussions of texts read at home. Two papers and minor writing assignments. All texts will be read in translations (and/or bilingual editions) and will be made available in a course reader.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Tim HamptonIn this course we will study the intersection between Renaissance literature and the great journeys of exploration and conquest that shaped the birth of the modern world. We will read fictional works by such authors as Shakespeare, Cervantes, More, Montaigne, Camoens, and Rabelais, in dialogue with writings of the sailors, missionaries, cartographers, scoundrels, and traders who expanded the limits of the European imagination with their accounts of “unknown” territory. In addition to reading a number of influential literary texts, we will work with primary historical material by studying maps, images, and collections of “curiosities.” Among the questions we will ask: how does the expansion of territory generate new forms of literary representation? How can you describe an object that has never been written about? How is a narrative like a map? Reading list:Rabelais: Gargantua and Pantagruel, trans. Screech (Penguin).

AscoliAlso listed as Italian Studies 120Among the many attempts to prove that William Shakespeare was not really William Shakespeare but someone else, there is a little book entitled “Shakespeare fu un italiano”: Shakespeare was an Italian. This course will argue no such thing. Rather, we will explore the various ways in which Shakespeare was touched by and touched Italy, a country he only knew through books and second hand report. We will look at some of the works of Italian literature that he read and rewrote in his plays (works by Boccaccio, Ariosto, Bandello, and others), plays of his that are set in Italy (Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Merchant of Venice), Italian operas, works of literature, and films which re-present or appropriate Shakespeare’s oeuvre (Verdi’s Otello; Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author; and so on). In the process we will think about the process by which works circulate between places and over time, and how two very different cultures reciprocally interpret each other and in so doing, reveal themselves.Requirements: attendance and participation; in-class presentations and short assignments; 3 papers (1250-1750 words); final take-home exam or longer paper (2500 words)Readings: William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet, Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Merchant of Venice, OthelloGiuseppe Verdi, OtelloLuigi Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an AuthorGuido Ruggiero and Laura Giannetti, trans.

H. RamThe literary avant-garde of the early twentieth century was the most radical expression of European modernism in literature and art. We will be focusing on the four most radical and creative of the avant-garde movements to have swept through Europe between the 1910’s and the 1930’s: Italian and Russian futurism, dada in Zurich and Paris, and French surrealism. We will be reading avant-garde poetry, manifestoes, performance texts and plays, experimental fiction and memoirs. We will also be paying some attention to parallel developments in the visual arts and cinema. Topics for discussion include literature and revolutionary politics, tradition and modernity, theoretical metalanguage and its relationship to artistic practice, poetic experimentation, the relationship of sound to meaning, the limits of art, the cult of technology, literature and utopia, and the relationship of writing to theories of the unconscious.Writers and artists include: Filippo Marinetti, Valentine de Saint-Point, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitsky, Viktor Shklovsky, Leon Trotsky, Tristan Tzara, Hugo Ball, and André Breton.Also listed as Slavic 131.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Sharon Aronson-Lehavi In this course we will discuss dramatic works by Jewish and Israeli playwrights, authors, and performance artists, in which relations between gender, religion, and cultural identity are explored. By engaging with performance theory we shall discuss topics such as gender and ethnicity, feminism and religion, identity politics in historical and contemporary contexts, and performance as a vehicle for exploring self-identity. In order to discuss plays which conflate gender and questions of modern Jewish identity, the course will contextualize the plays with various modes of representation, examining the relations between the dramatic styles which are employed and at times invented by the authors and the social questions that are negotiated through the plays. These modes of representation include realistic drama (and the critique of realism); documentary drama; epic and Brechtian drama; Écriture féminine; solo performance, and performance-art. Classes will be accompanied by DVD recordings of many of the plays we discuss. All readings are in English.CL 155:1

“Kafka and World Literature” explores ongoing debates about what world literature means through the lens of Kafka, who has played a significant role in them. From the earlier works that Kafka re-imagined, including the Odyssey, Don Quixote, and David Copperfield, to works that in some way react to or adapt Kafka’s work, this course will examine the ideas of world literature, literary traditions, and influence. Using different genres and media, such as film (Federico Fellini’s Intervista) and graphic novels (Art Spiegelman’s Maus) and authors from Europe (Svevo, Robbe-Grillet and Gogol), North America (Philip Roth), South America (Borges, Márquez, and Lispector), and Asia (Kobo Abe) the course covers a wide range of works which will aid the class in our discussion of world literature and Kafka’s work itself. This course invites students both to compare texts as well as to question what is lost and gained when comparing works across time periods, languages, and genres.Course Requirements: Active participation, frequent short responses, three short papers.Texts:Required Texts:Franz Kafka, The Sons 0805208860Franz Kafka, Amerika: The Man who Disappeared 0811215695Franz Kafka, The Trial 0805209999Clarice Lispector, Passion according to G.H. 0816617120Gabriel García Márquez, Chronicle of a Death Foretold 140003471XKobo Abe, The Woman in the Sand Dunes 0679733787Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jealousy 080215106XPhilip Roth, The Breast 0679749012Art Spiegelman, Maus 0394747232Suggested (the parts required will be available on-line):Albert Camus, The Stranger 0679720200Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote 0060934344J.M.

V. KahnThis course will explore the history of the idea of human rights and the role of literature in depicting human rights abuses and in advancing human rights claims, from the sixteenth century to the present, with a particular focus on twentieth-century works. How does literature contribute to the invention of the concept of human rights? How do the authors talk about human dignity? What issues do they identify as central in their discussions of social justice? What representational strategies do the authors employ to narrate violence without sensationalizing it or turning the reader into a voyeur? What is the role of literature in testifying to human rights abuses? Can literature make a difference in the real world? We will read fictional texts and memoirs from the U.S., the former Soviet Union, China, South Africa, the Balkans, Germany, Argentina, and Kenya.Readings will include Montaigne, Las Casas, Harriet Jacobs, Elie Wiesel, Ariel Dorfman, Slavenka Drakulic, Eugenia Ginsburg and J.

M. BernsteinAlthough our subject is “Modernism’s Epic Ambitions,” I will not be concentrating solely upon the relationships of the works we are discussing to any single over-arching motif, nor to various more traditional literary-philosophical taxonomies. Instead, I want to explore a set of issues, both historical and theoretical, whose specific family resemblance will only emerge as our discussion itself unfolds.  Close attention will be paid to the ways in which modernist artists experimented with the technical issues of form and structure as well as with their innovative use of new thematic materials.In the first part of the semester, we will be investigating several of the most important modernists figures involved in both the theoretical conception and the artistic creation of a new sense of what a modernist masterpiece entails. From that foundation, we will read James Joyce’s Ulysses, the archetypal modernist prose masterpiece. Regular and active in-class participation and a willingness to engage in copious reading are the principal prerequisites for the course.Required Reading:Various hand-outsJames Joyce, Ulysses, Random House (paperback)CL 155:1

Harsha Ram The novel is a modern genre, imported and adapted to Indian circumstances during the heyday of the British Empire. Over the course of the summer we will be reading British novels set in India, as well as novels written by Indian authors. We will be exploring how British fiction reflected on the “romance” of British Raj, the cultural differences and political hierarchies that arose between the rulers, the ruled, and the middlemen and women who mediated between them. The emergence of the Indian novel coincided with the rise of a new modernizing Indian élite that would lead India’s freedom struggle. The Indian novel thus became a crucial site for cultural debate. Was it possible to adapt western cultural forms while still questioning Britain’s political domination? What new insights could the novel’s narrative structure provide into Indian reality? How did the Indian novel encompass the bewildering multiplicity of local and regional voices, histories and narratives that constitute the Indian experience? How are we to understand the sudden emergence of Indian English literature on the world literary scene? These are some of the questions we will addressing over the course of the semester.Rudyard Kipling, KimRabindranath Tagore, GoraE.M. Forster, Passage to IndiaRaja Rao, KanthapuraG.V.

Enrique LimaThe Hungarian Marxist thinker Georg Lukács argues in his influential The Theory of the Novel (1920) that the outward form of the novel is essentially biographical. That is, the novel explores a problem symbolized by the story of a character’s life.  Ian Watt, a thinker of a very different political and aesthetic temperament than Lukács, says in his equally seminal The Rise of the Novel (1957) that novels are obligated to convince their readers of the individuality of their characters. Most theorists and historians of the novel would concur with Lukács and Watt on the centrality of the individual to the development of the novel. But what if a novel orders its narrative universe with something other than a central figure whose experiences provide the organic limits to the story? What if in complicating the seeming naturalness of the biographical form a novel manages to perform a critique of the historical association between the “rise” of the novel as a literary mode and the universalization of the discourses of the individual that sustained the emergence and global spread of capitalist modernity? This course addresses these questions through careful readings of British, U.S., and Latin American novels. We will also read significant theoretical works on the novel.Possible readings include: William Faulkner Absalom, Absalom!, José María Arguedas Yawar Fiesta, Georg Lukács The Theory of the Novel, Nancy Armstrong How Novels Think, Alex Woloch The One vs. the Many, and Charles Taylor Sources of the Self.Tue-Thu. 3.30-5:00 p.m

H. RamModern Indian literature is as linguistically diverse and culturally complex as India itself. It comprises writing in the numerous modern Indian languages as well as in English, the latter widely accepted today as a local lingua franca as well as the language connecting India to the wider global arena. While both literature and oral story-telling have existed in India for millennia, the novel is a modern genre, imported and adapted during the heyday of nineteenth-century British colonialism. The emergence of the novel in India coincided with the rise of a new modernizing Indian élite that would lead India’s freedom struggle. The Indian novel thus became a crucial site for cultural debate. Was it possible to adapt western cultural forms while still questioning Britain’s political domination? How were Indian languages to acquire the standards of a flexible modern prose? What new insights could the novel’s narrative structure provide into Indian reality? How did the Indian novel explore established social structures, arising from the loyalties of family, caste, religion, gender and region, alongside the modernizing impact of British colonialism, indigenous reform movements, and the postcolonial state? How did the Indian novel encompass the bewildering multiplicity of local and regional voices, histories and narratives that constitute the Indian experience? How are we to understand the sudden emergence of Indian English literature on the world literary scene, aided in no small part by the visibility of the global Indian diaspora? How does the Indian novel map onto to imported literary categories such as social realism, modernism or magical realism?Reading List:Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, The Poison Tree (1873)Rabindranath Tagore, The Home and the World (1916)Mulk Raj Anand, Untouchable (1935)Premchand, The World of Premchand.

Office hours: Thursday, 2:15-3:30 and by appt., 5223 DwinelleThis course is devoted to a study of the concept of Global South, first as a theoretical question belonging to geopolitics and, second, as a project sustained first by colonizers, explorers, and later by creative writers.  To approach the idea of “South,” we’ll focus in particular on the representation of the South in the literatures of the Americas and, by way of contrast, the European South (specifically, the case of Italy). Starting with Darwin’s observations about Patagonia and Mary Shelley’s assessments of Italy, we will read about the ways in which the South enters the cultural imagination to challenge cosmopolitan sensibilities and the role of the state. We will take this through the tropes of “barbarism” that are carried in descriptions of the South along with the potential for resistance that Southern lands encourage (especially through figures of the outlaw and the brigand). We’ll then bring in the racial component that seems to constitute the paradigm of South (seen in Faulkner’s concern for the legacy of slavery; writings by African migrants who have emigrated to Italy; Chicano writers who have activated the reality of the border as a literary trope; the Mapuche indigenous voices in southern Chile and Argentina whose demands for rectifications of land rights and social recognition have become a thorn in the hide of the state).Our work will require a study of the operations of travel discourse, the aestheticization of nature, the building of cultural difference (based on race, language, and nation), and the literary and cultural representations of utopias and social justice. Based on the theoretical materials supplied in the first part of the course, students will be invited to report on their own versions of “South” and to lead us in discussion of the cultural and literary dynamics that their research on “South” engenders (this can be “South of the Border,” the South Bronx, South Los Angeles, or Southern Spain, for instance).In addition to the list of required texts, lots of supplementary materials (essays, films, music) to chomp on. Several short response papers, class presentations, and a research paper.Required texts:Aira, Cèsar. The Hare, New York: New DirectionsLa liebre. Buenos Aires: EmecéChatwin, Bruce. In Patagonia.

Professor F. MasielloThis is a course that addresses the questions: What can literature do to expose social injustice? What can literature do to help us come to terms with the horrors of human rights violations, torture, censorship, and disappearance? How does the creative text engage the illegality of regimes that resist the rule of reason? In this course, we will move toward the representational dynamics of human rights that are played out in literary texts and the visual arts. Representation, then, is both an aesthetic and political issue:  we ask not only about how we might name the unspeakable, but also about who gets to speak.  The emphasis will be on texts  that emerged in Latin America in response to the “dirty wars” of the 1970s and 80s and, more recently, the human rights violations against women and sexual and ethnic minorities. This will require us to think about how bodies and voices are constructed in literature, but it will also lead us to reflect on the locus of truth and discovery that we find in the creative text and the ways it might lead us to action. A good amount of theoretical reading along with novels, poetry, and visual arts.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Enrique LimaThe representation of the indigenous peoples of the Americas is one of the central issues of the literature of the hemisphere. From the need to justify and rationalize the genocide and displacement of native peoples, to the persistence of an ambivalent fascination with Indians, to the aesthetic experimentation with native epistemologies, and, finally, to the contemporary reassessment of Native social and literary history, the broad geographic and historical distribution of the contested representations of indigeneity is crucial for understanding the literature of the Americas. The novel, the great narrative form of capitalist modernity, has been equally at home in capital’s peripheries. Urban spaces and rural “backwardness,” free market relations and coerced labor, social progress and in Roberto Schwarz’ words “the regressive potentialities of modernization,” the plasticity of American—used here in the hemispheric sense—novel has been capable of representing such extremes. In this course we will read South, Central, and North American novelists in order to examine the relationship between the representation of indigeneity and the development of the novel in the Americas.Possible readings include: James Fenimore Cooper Last of the Mohicans, José María Arguedas Deep Rivers, Rosario Castellanos The Nine Guardians, Victor Montejo Mr. Putison’s Adventures Among the Maya, D’Arcy McNickle The Surrounded, and Louise Erdrich Tracks.

Annalee RejhonA study of Indo-European mythology as it is preserved in some of the earliest myth texts in Celtic, Norse, and Greek literatures. The meaning of myth will be examined and compared from culture to culture to see how this meaning may shed light on the ethos of each society as it is reflected in its literary works.  The role of oral tradition in the preservation of early myth will also be explored. The Celtic texts that will be read are the Irish Second Battle of Mag Tuired and The Táin, and in Welsh, the tales of Lludd and Llefelys and Math; the Norse texts will include Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda, the Ynglinga Saga, and the Poetic Edda; the Greek texts are Hesiod’s Theogony and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.All texts will be available in English translation.Course requirements include a midterm and final examination.No prerequisites.Readings:Fitzgerald, Robert, tr.

Dr Giuliana PercoIn 1914, the outbreak of the “Great War” marked the beginning of a bloody conflict that transformed the Western World. At the end of the war, empires had disappeared, brand new countries had been created, while after-war political and economic instability allowed for the development of future extremist ideologies. In Italy, the end of WWI resulted in expanded territorial borders, an impoverished economy and an unstable society.In Italian 120, we will analyze how literature, film, and art described and re-interpreted not only the grim experience of the war and its consequences, but also the years immediately before the conflict.We will read works by Italian writers Italo Svevo, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Emilio Lussu, but also by authors from different cultures, like Wilfred Owen, Jaroslav Hašek, and Joseph Roth, among others.We will also watch several films set in this time period, such as the 1930 version of All Quiet on the Western Front, Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory, and Federico Fellini’s E la nave va (And the Ship Sails On).Taught in English: No Italian language knowledge required.For more information, please email gperco@berkeley.eduWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Ulf OlssonViolence, understood as both verbal, psychological and physical acts, has always been a central part of theatre, and forms a strong current in European theatre also in the last hundred years. Reaching from verbal insults to systematic terror and torture, theatrical violence can also be directed towards the audience. The course will discuss different aspects of violence, how it can be understood and what its effects as well as its dramaturgical potential can be. An important dimension will be the ethical problems that violence confronts us with. Against a backdrop of European drama from the 20th century, we will look at different aspects of violence in Scandinavian drama, from Ibsen and Strindberg to contemporary playwrights Norén and Fosse.DramaJon Fosse, TBA

The seminar will offer readings, discussions, and a sense of the trajectory across time and circumstance of some of the most influential texts in literary theory, criticism, and aesthetics from Plato and Aristotle until today. We will also attempt to apply these theoretical traditions to the actual practice of literary criticism by engaging (in essay assignments) the various theories and methodologies we’re studying with particular literary texts that students will likely be writing about in their Honors Theses. We’ll thus likewise consider some of the nuts and bolts involved in undertaking the sustained critical essay of forty or more pages that the Honors Thesis involves. The theory and criticism we’ll read and apply will include aspects of Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Neo-Classical, Enlightenment, Romantic and post-Romantic traditions, although we will emphasize the study of modern and recent trends (including New Criticism, Reader-Response, Psychoanalysis, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism/Deconstruction, New Historicism, Marxism, Feminism, and Race, Gender, and Sexuality-focused criticism). Our double-focus throughout the seminar will be on how literary theory and criticism have historically helped­-or hindered­-understandings of literature and literary/cultural works, and of how students can make literary theory and criticism help them as they think and work towards their upcoming H195 Honors Thesis projects (in terms of interpretation, analysis, methodology, and the practical tasks involved in writing a sustained critical essay).We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

What are some of the problems in finding a language for pain? What makes poems a particularly suitable vehicle for such efforts?What difference does it make what metaphors we use when we speak of illness and healing? What legitimacy is there in the idea of “illness as metaphor”?How are “literary” conventions operative in clinical dialogue? In case histories? In scientific writing? How do those conventions shape the information we give and receive about disease, illness, and pain?What do our popular images and literary representations of doctors, nurses, and sick people reflect about the assumptions we make about illness?

Professor Sharon Aronson-LehaviThis course examines the concept of holiness in Western medieval and modern theatre and performance. We start with late medieval religious theatre, especially the genre of the mystery and passion plays, in which a unique blend of scriptural source materials, religious cultural context, and daily life was at the basis of a wide-scale theatrical endeavor.  We will then move to examine the renewed interest in the concept of “holy theatre” in modernism and nowadays. Throughout the twentieth century and within an otherwise secular cultural framework, a large number of theatre theorists and experimental creators viewed the theatre as a space with the potential of evoking ritualistic and modern “holy” experiences. Such performances often exist on the threshold of holiness and profanity. Texts include The York Plays (selections, fifteenth century), Everyman (anonymous, fifteenth century), Mystery Bouffe (Mayakovsky, 1918), Akropolis (Grotowski, 1961), Dionysus in ’69 (Schechner, 1969), Bible Project (Yerushalmi, 1996/1998), The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told (Rudnick, 1998), Passion Play (Ruhl, 2003), Jerry Springer: The Opera (Thomas & Lee, 2003), and more. Classes will be accompanied by DVD excerpts of the performances discussed.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

M. KotzamanidouModern Greek fiction writers have used myth and history to support various artistic and /or ideological purposes, to deepen and validate authorial concerns and to provide a common ground for communication and dialogue with their audience. This course explores the use of myth and history in modern Greek fiction through selected literary works from the 1880’s to the 1980’s.  The method of the investigation is multileveled, both contextual and intertextual. From a historical perspective, these approximately one hundred years constitute a critical period of rapid, and often violent, historical changes that directly affect society and culture. It is within this period that modern Greek fiction develops stylistically and linguistically, and the modern Greek novel comes finally to its own as a genre, by asserting its artistic, modernist autonomy. It is during this period that modern Greek fiction writers will experiment with traditional genres and styles, emphasizing their artistic identity as creators rather than as preservers of culture, but still sharing as participants in it. It is also during this period that the use of myth and history will be explored by authors of fiction for a variety of reasons, through a variety of materials, in a variety of ways: classical mythological elements, historically-based ideological constructs, complex literary tropes, cultural metaphors, folkloric themes, all will be brought to bear.This course utilizes material from the areas of history, fiction, mythology and folklore,literary theory and criticism, film.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Maria KotzamanidouThis course examines a selection of novels (19th to 21st cent.), placed in different historical and social contexts, each novel focused on the character of a young woman. Although these characters are contextualized by the emotionally charged climate of a social or historical crisis, the emphasis in their search is not of political but of personal nature. Through a variety of narrative techniques, which include first person narratives, practiced by their female or, more interestingly, male authors, these female protagonists involve the reader in their struggle to wrest their personal identity from the identity of the community, or that of the family, and to salvage it from the historical trauma. As such, the journey of self-discovery for these characters appears a complex, interior Odyssey which often remains irresolute and it is frequently suspended between history and myth.(Greek texts are also available in English translation. History, Criticism and Theory are in English. Films are with English subtitles.)We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Always, political and historical upheavals and wars have most impacted the homes and families of local populations. To the inhabitants of the Greek island of Lesbos, the contemporary refugee crisis is almost like a replay of the events of 1922, a result of the failed, Greek expansionist war shrouded with emotional and apocalyptic overtones. This was the war that marked the end of the centuries­ old, multiethnic Ottoman Empire and ushered in the modern Turkish nation. It also brought refugees from Asia Minor to Greece, and to the island of Lesbos. They came in small, ill equipped boats overflowing with human cargo. The languages and cultures of the displaced populations, caught in the politics and ideologies of the times, are different now. The politics and the players are different. The topography of the passage to the island is the same. Six miles, half an hour’s journey from the coast of Turkey, and you have left behind the turmoil and warring forces in the Middle East for the safety, security and prosperity of Europe with the island being the first contact. Still, whatever the differences in cultures, languages, political forces or ideological motivations behind both movements of populations, as at the core of any such human catastrophe, there is always the common, powerful need to find a safe haven from disaster, poverty, lack of safety. To reach home.This class will examine various narratives of displacement through a selection of Greek novels dating from the end of the nineteenth century to the 21st century. The characters in these fictions struggle to escape from their liminal state and to heal the profound trauma inflicted on their identity as a result of violent disruptions. In the emotional space between the lost home and the state of a transitional existence, the homes and homelands of the mind are created. Built on desire and imagination, they are there to compensate for the lost comfort, to access hope, and to anchor the characters’ sense of identity shipwrecked in the ocean of abrupt, violent change.The literary works will be placed in the context of Modern Greek history and in the context of contemporary Greek and European thought.

Maria KotzamanidouThis course focuses on the examination of female deviance from the accepted standards of society in terms of attitude and behavior. This course examines representations of deviance and the violation of the norms (social, cultural, gender, biological) by central female characters in 19th and 20th century Modern Greek fiction. By accepting these literary texts as cultural texts, and by placing them in their historical context, this course also examines how these powerful, polysemic characters are associated not only with literal but also with mythological levels of meaning. As Greek society shifts its focus from the community to the individual, the creation of these voices appears to echo the authors’ own concerns regarding the death of national ideologies, the disunity of the nation and the traumas of its modernization.All Greek materials for the Course are available in English translation.Foreign Films are subtitled.

Maria Kotzamanidou course has no prerequisitesThis course is concerned with works of fiction written before or after the seven-year military dictatorship of 1967, a regime marked by various degrees of censorship. These works examine the relationship between established structures (social, historical, religious) and modern worldviews that reflect multiple levels of reality and multiple belief systems. In these novels, whether written before or after the Greek totalitarian regime, the vision of the future is prophetic and frequently apocalyptic.  It rests not on a clash but on a dialectical tension between divine and demonic concepts that define man’s world in literary representations. These concepts are communicated to the reader in enigmatic, unstable forms, in a climate of pervasive anxiety, or with latent energy released as textual violence. They appear as literary responses to a crisis, thus, forcing the political, social, or cultural space in the text to a dystopia.Greek texts are available in English translation.

Maria KotzamanidouIn this course we will examine the various forms of ethical behavior in Modern Greek fiction which lead to valuations of “right (good) or wrong (bad)” actions, intensions, or decisions. We will distinguish the differences between ethics and morality and we will examine the philosophies, cultural or religious, that provide the ethical systems against which such actions are measured. What does the author intend to communicate to the reader as a result of such valuations? What are their political implications? We will also examine the ways with which these contexts are effected by the continually changing Greek historical realities, Greek efforts toward westernization, exposure to foreign literatures through translations, and social necessities.All Greek Material is available in English translation.History, theory and criticism are in English.Films are in English or with English subtitlesNo PrerequisitesWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

M. KotzamanidouWith its varied cultural history and its geographical position as a bridge between East and West, Turkey, once the center of the Ottoman Empire, has always attracted the imagination of travelers and of writers.  The representation of the Turk in Western literature, from Elizabethan plays to Victorian literature, as Kamil Aydin has shown in Western Images of Turkey, has given rise to various books and articles in contemporary theory and criticism.In the realm of theory, a discourse of difference, applied by Michel Foucault in his examination of knowledge and power, was later adopted (and adapted) by Edward Said in his study of Orientalism, a practice of control and domination of the East by the West. Orientalism with its emphasis on the exoticism, violence, cruelty and other stereotypical characteristics of the Oriental, was intent to present the Turk as the European’s other. For the Greeks who shared homeland space with the Ottomans, as Ottoman subjects for nearly four hundred years in some parts, the Turks were seen as invariably pitted against the Hellenic identity. After the War of Greek Independence, in the 1830’s, linguist and historian Jacob Fallmerayer proclaimed the loss of the Hellenic identity and its disappearance into the engulfing waves of Slavism. Such proclamations seemed to reinforce the Greeks’ anxiety about geopolitical proximity with the Turks, whom they saw as
obstacles to receiving their full and rightful Hellenic legacy.Regarding Greek authors, the fiction we will read this semester is constituted of novels in which the Turk is the main character, or one of the main characters, as well as a complex authorial creation. The object of this course, then, is to examine the representation of the Turk in 19th and 20th century Greek fiction and to analyze the sources and the dynamics (historical, social, and literary) that allowed for the individualized or stereotypical, for the positive or for the negative elements in these literary representations to be formed.No prerequisites.Greek materials are available in English translation.

Maria KotzamanidouThis course will examine the work of Greek intellectuals (philosophers and literary writers) who, as adults, in moments of Greek historical and political crises, left Greece and emigrated to other European countries. The primary corpus of the work of these authors was written in the languages of their adopted countries, thus, allowing them to make major contributions to the specific intellectual life of those countries and to European letters in general. Even though these writers have appeared in Greece only in Greek translation, it will be interesting to examine to what extend each crisis, which drove them away from their original homeland, contributed to their evolution, and defined the direction of their ideas abroad.All materials from foreign languages for this course are presented in English translation.Greek History, theory and criticism are in English.

M. KotzamanidouThis course examines certain aspects of the relationship between fascism and Greek fiction. From the 1930’s to the 1970’s, Greece experienced three different repressive fascist regimes: The dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas, the (Nazi) Occupation, and the military dictatorship of 1967. Fiction writers, dealing with that period, use prose fiction, particularly the novel, in order to make sense of the violent historical events and changes in political and social thought during those years. Trapped between exalting leftist ideologies and repressive fascism, the fiction of these writers points toward the theoretical perspectives of New and Modern Historicism which are being used as a reaction to repressive power structures. Thus, the position of these authors forces them to re-define the ways of writing historical and political fiction and ultimately to explore new aspects in the relationship between history and the novel.Readings in history and theory are available in English.Literary materials are available in Greek and in English translation.Films chosen for the course are subtitled in English.CL 171:1

M. KotzamanidouThis course examines the role of the child’s voice in Modern Greek fictional narratives, novellas and novels, in which the common thematic thread is the impact of historical events on Modern Greek life, society and family.  In these narratives, the ever silent children, passing undetected through the pages of canonical history, are given a voice, whether as narrators or characters, a voice used to establish a different view and perspective on Modern Greek history. It is a view that veers away from traditional gender roles, such as the male heroic, or the female suffering and forbearing.Given the experiences related by these narratives, the violence and ruptures of wars, the breakdown of supports for the civilian populations, the annihilation of political life, famine and death, the absurdity of power structures, it is natural that the children’s responses will underscore the psychological, moral and ethical implications embedded in the impact of such historical events. However, in the Modern Greek fiction selected for this course, the voices of children are also critical voices. They are frequently subversive and reach out, often with sharp irony and humor, into the relationships between the historical and the social realm as well as the literary. As such, these narratives highlight a whole range of authorial strategies that aim at the meeting of the historical event and the literary production. In fact, they illuminate the distance required for the transformation of historical experience into story and narrative. Within the self-consciousness of modernist and post-modernist fiction narratives, these voices of children critically bring out not only the moral, ethical and psychological dimensions of the experience of history but also its impact on the creation of fiction. In addition, these voices present us with implications regarding the writing of history itself.No prerequisites.Greek literary texts are available in English translation.

[Note: Students enrolling in this senior seminar will be assumed to have had experience with the close reading and the analysis of poetic form, content, and context, and to be at least somewhat familiar with the main lines or moments in American poetry’s 19th-20th C. development, from Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, through the modernism of  Pound, H.D., Eliot, Stevens, Moore, Hughes, Brooks, et al.]
Perhaps the three most influential experimental or avant-gardist groupings within the period of American poetry beginning just after 1945 are the Beats, the New York School, and the poets of–and associated with–the educational and arts experiment known as Black Mountain College.  Located in a collection of church buildings in Black Mountain, North Carolina, the College actually began (in 1933) well before “Beat” or “New York School” poetry came into being.  Black Mountain College was, moreover, a crucial venue for teaching and experiment in the various arts and their possible interactions, from painting and sculpture to musical composition and performance, dance, and poetry.  Key–and some very famous–figures of American post-World War II art and culture taught or studied (or did both) at Black Mountain.This seminar will consider a number of the poets who taught or studied at Black Mountain, or whose work was eventually drawn into its orbit and legacies.  We’ll focus our readings on the poetry, poetics, and criticism of (and we’ll read criticism about and related to) Charles Olson (who was for some years Rector of Black Mountain College), Robert Creeley, Denise Levertov, and Robert Duncan. We’ll also consider, more briefly (and depending on time) American poets often linked–sometimes fairly directly, sometimes in complex relation–to Black Mountain poetics, such as  Paul Blackburn, Hilda Morley, John Wieners, Susan Howe, and Michael Palmer.  The seminar will of necessity look back–and thus read some of–the earlier modernist poetry so vital to the Black Mountaineers: that of Pound, H.D., Eliot, Williams and others. Significant attention will be paid to Olson’s theories of “projective verse” and “open field composition”: to what they do or don’t mean for Olson’s poetry and that of other post-World War II poets; to their relation on the one hand to Romantic theories and practices of “organic form,” and, on the other, to classic modernist notions of expression, construction, constellation, and force-field; and finally, to the ways that the formal or stylistic matters at issue in all of these do or don’t themselves become sociopolitical questions.  In its last weeks the seminar will, if all too briefly, comparatively consider Black Mountain poetry and poetics’ international dialogues and its reach, by engaging the conversations between Black Mountain and British, French, German, and Latin American poetry.  [Note: While the ability to read in French, German, and/or Spanish will obviously be helpful, it is NOT required; all poems originally written in languages other than English will be read in facing-page, original-plus-English-translation versions.]We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Dora Zhang“Well – what remains to be written after that?” wondered Virginia Woolf in a 1922 letter about Marcel Proust’s monumental seven-volume work, In Search of Lost Time. Chronicling everything from the strangeness of kissing to the casual cruelties of snobbery, Proust’s novel conducts a vast and searching inquiry into the nooks and crannies of human experience. At the same time, it’s an unflinching account of a particular era, as the glittering decadence of belle époque Paris gave way to the horrors to the First World War, and rapidly changing modern life came to include new inventions like the telephone, the automobile, and the cinema.An astute and admiring reader of Proust, Woolf carried out her own searches in her fiction, examining “an ordinary mind on an ordinary day,” the “incessant shower of innumerable atoms…as they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday.” At the same time that she probed the depths of the human psyche, Woolf was also deeply engaged with the world around her – that of early 20th century Britain – depicting intersecting lives in London, the effects of war and colonialism, and newly prominent issues of gender and sexuality.Today Proust and Woolf are considered two of the most brilliant and inventive writers of the 20th century, challenging and redefining the form of the novel and continuing to speak to us a century later. In this seminar we will read a large selection of their works, looking at their aesthetic innovations as well as the philosophical and historical questions they raise. Themes will include: the experience of time, the workings of memory and perception, what it means to be a self, the nature of knowledge, the operations of social power, and the logic of love.TextsMarcel Proust, Swann’s Way, Within a Budding Grove; The Guermantes Way (selections); Sodom and Gomorrah (selections), Time Regained. We will be reading the Modern Classics Library edition of the Scott Moncrieff translation.Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, Between the ActsSupplementary critical readings (e.g. Freud, Bergson, Sedgwick) will be distributed as PDFs.

S. VolppIn this course we will read novels drawn from both the British and the Chinese traditions that experiment intensively with the representation of other minds. At what historical junctures does the representation of interiority become an issue? What is the distinction between individual psychology and consciousness?  How do novelists sustain our uncertainty as to our comprehension of fictional minds? Topics include Austen’s work with what later would be called free indirect discourse, James’ presentation of the restricted consciousness of a child, Woolf’s use of stream of consciousness, and Cao Xueqin’s experimentation with interior dialogue.Readings:Jane Austen, Mansfield Park

Professor Karl BrittoIn recent years, many of the most celebrated and widely-read authors of postcolonial literature have produced novels that engage with a variety of sub-genres within the field of crime fiction, including the “hardboiled” detective novel, the roman noir, and the serial killer novel. What might account for this literary turn toward the dystopian, toward texts constructed around mysteries and often marked by shocking descriptions of extreme violence? In what ways do the genres of crime fiction allow writers to engage with long and complex colonial and post-colonial histories, and to address issues of social, political, and economic injustice? To what extent is storytelling itself implicated in these narratives of crime? In what ways do writers push the generic boundaries of crime fiction, and to what ends? How do bodies function as sites of textual meaning in crime fiction, and how do crime narratives complicate notions of identity and identification? In this seminar, we will consider these questions and others through readings of several novels whose narratives emerge out of different historical, cultural, and geographic contexts. Please note: because electronic devices make interesting conversation difficult, students are asked to come to class with paper copies of the course reader and books.

Professor Vicky KahnThis course will explore the history of the idea of human rights and the role of literature in depicting human rights abuses and in advancing human rights claims, with a particular focus on twentieth-century literature. How does literature contribute to the invention of the concept of human rights? How do the authors talk about human dignity? What issues do they identify as central in their discussions of social justice? What narrative strategies do the authors employ to represent violence without sensationalizing it or turning the reader into a voyeur? What is the role of literature in testifying to human rights abuses? Can literature make a difference in the real world? We will read fictional texts and memoirs from the U.S., the former Soviet Union, China, South Africa, the Balkans, Germany, and Argentina.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Dora ZhangIn Georg Lukács’s seminal 1936 essay “Narrate or Describe?” he identified narration and description as distinctive modes of the novel, each appropriate to a different form of society under a different period of capitalism. Although Lukács was not the first to distinguish between narration and description, his essay was decisive in entrenching this opposition and, moreover, in denigrating the latter: whereas narration is the dramatic mode of writers and characters who are active participants, description is the tedious mode of passive observers.Departing from Lukács, this course will reexamine the question “narrate or describe?” reappraising the features and potentials of its neglected term. We will look at a range of critical texts (Auerbach, Genette, Jameson, Franco Moretti, Mieke Bal), testing their claims against a selection of realist, naturalist, and modernist novels spanning the 19th to early 20th centuries (e.g. Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Conrad, Musil). Our questions will include: what are the characteristics of narration and description and why have they so often been opposed in theories of the novel? How can we understand shifts in literary conventions in relation to wider social and economic changes? What assumptions about knowledge and value are embedded in different descriptive frameworks? In addition, we will also consider theories and histories of description in other fields, notably art history and history of science. What do we do when we describe an image in words? How did the advent of photography and later cinema change the role of description in novels? What is the relation of description to empirical observation, and how have ideas about scientific observation also changed over time?  We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Christopher Davis* satisfies L&S Arts and Literature breadth requirementWhat is the difference between poetry and prose? Do they convey the same kind of knowledge or experience? How is this difference represented on the written page? Such questions fascinated writers during the Medieval and Early Modern Periods. The Middle Ages saw the rise of prose narratives as an alternative to verse romance and lyric, as well as an explosion in vernacular manuscripts, which collected, defined and obsessively categorized literary form. Many genres of prose and poetry came to be identified with new ideas of linguistic, cultural and national identity, especially during the Early Modern period, when the imitiation of Greek and Latin forms allowed writers to establish cultural and intellectual links to the classical past. In this course, we will explore the correspondences among genre, language and the material text by reading a broad range of works in poetry and prose, including lyrics by Dante, Petrarch and Ronsard, Arthurian romance, Don Quixote, crusade chronicles and the travels of Marco Polo.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Eric NaimanThis seminar will be devoted to a careful rereading of Nabokov’s most famous novel. We will consider the critical and ethical debates that have arisen around the book, and we will look at the novel’s transposition to the screen (Nabokov’s screenplay, Kubrick’s classic and Lyne’s recent treatment). We will examine the novel’s relationship to the genre of pornography and to notions of a discursive “body.” The novel will serve us as a focus for an investigation of critical methodologies and their usefulness when applied to a resolutely self-conscious text. We will read Lolita throughout the semester, and we will analyze portions of the novel in class and in written exercises throughout the fall.Students will write two 5-10 page papers and five three-page analyses of individual chapters.

Professor Judith ButlerWe will pursue an introduction to Freud’s basic works on the unconscious, dreams, the death drive, sexuality, and symptoms, by considering  the narrative, figurative, and argumentative dimensions of his case studies, his readings on literary and visual art, and his Interpretation of Dreams.   Freud referred to his theory of drives as his own “poetry” and often approached the case study as a story-teller.  Does the literary dimension of Freud’s work contribute to the controversy over whether his claims are ultimately justifiable? To answer this question, we have first to pursue some others:   Does he tell a story in order to make an argument, or are his arguments so many stories?  At stake is whether there is an argumentative dimension to his narrative writing. Does he sidestep the need to make arguments by using and analysing figures and telling stories?  Why are literary works so important to his analysis, and how do they relate to the structure of dreams and fantasy?  Finally, does Freud give us a way to think about the relationship between literature and argument?  Can we say that psychoanalysis is one name for that relationship?   Among the topics to be considered are repression, the unconscious, sexuality, Oedipus, rage, mourning, civilization, and war as they relate to basic questions of morality and aesthetics.Required Texts:General Psychological Theory,  Freud, Touchstone  Press

Professor Robert Kaufman[Note: Students enrolling in this senior seminar will be assumed to have had experience with close reading and with analyzing poetic form, content, and context.  Though not a requirement, it would also be helpful if students were at least somewhat familiar with the main lines or moments in American poetry’s 19th-20th C. development, from Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, through the modernism of  Eliot, Pound, Stevens, Moore, Hughes, Brooks, et al, the postmodernism of Plath, Lowell, Sexton, the Beats, Black Mountain, San Francisco Renaissance, etc.]This seminar will center on the work of the poets of what’s popularly called “The New York School” (initially meant to connect the poetry to “New York School” Abstract  Expressionist and post-Abstract Expressionist painting). Perhaps more often than any other grouping within immediately post-1945 American poetry, the New York School has–controversially–been termed “The Last Avant-Garde,” in the specific sense of being deemed the last trend within experimental modernist and early postmodernist American poetry to have captured “mainstream” attention and admiration. The New York School poets have in some ways become legendary: John Ashbery has pulled off the trick of consistently emerging, over the last few decades, at the heart of debates about “who is America’s `greatest’ living poet?” and as a favorite case study in the “difficulty” or “obscurity” of modern and contemporary poetry; Frank O’Hara’s poetry has, for better or worse, been seen to constitute an oeuvre that manages to seem simultaneously hip, spontaneous, accessible, and yet brilliant, philosophically weighty, and culturally (also perhaps politically) provocative; Barbara Guest  has been repeatedly mentioned as one of postmodern America’s most innovative, rigorous practitioners and re-makers of lyric art’s forms and structures, and its ambition to capture social experience that might otherwise escape apprehension; James Schuyler has become a model for crystalline figurings of how the temporal experience of everyday life can yield genuine philosophical complexity.We’ll begin the seminar with brief but crucial readings in one of the international sources for much–though by no means all–of the New York School’s poetic education: the tradition of modern French poetry and poetics that extends from Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Mallarmé  through the French surrealists; readings will concentrate on English translations of these poets, though we’ll work with facing-page French/English editions, and we’ll pay some attention to the prosody of the original French texts. [Students will not be required to have reading knowledge of French, though it’ll of course prove beneficial to those who do.] We’ll then spend the bulk of the semester closely and carefully reading the poetry and criticism of, and about, the above-mentioned New York School poets (with special emphasis on poetic form and its experimental attempts to engage sociopolitical, cultural, and historical reality, and on the question of what does–or doesn’t–make certain kinds of poetry or poetic form aesthetically, socially, culturally, or politically experimental and/or “avant-garde”). Via the New York School’s own critical writings and other texts of criticism, theory, and aesthetics, we’ll think about New York School poetry’s relations to the French, British, and American poetry that precedes and influences it, as well as its conversations with the international poetry (and related art) contemporaneous with it, from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and Europe.  We’ll spend some time thinking about the importance of Abstract Expressionist and post-Abstract Expressionist painting to the New York School poets, and we’ll therefore look at some of that painting, and at the art criticism and theory, that have engaged it, including art criticism by the New York School poets themselves. (While we’ll read the literary and art criticism of a number of different critics, theorists, philosophers, and poets, the critic we’ll read more of than any other will be one of our main poets: John Ashbery.) Finally, if time permits, we’ll glance at the “second generation and after” New York School poets, as well as poets adjacent to and in conversation with the New York School, including Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Bill Berkson, Bernadette Mayer, Ron Padgett, Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, and Eileen Myles.

N. LargierEuropean cultures of the 16th and 17th centuries have been obsessed with the power of images and imagination, of figures and figuration. Poetic practices of mirroring, linking, and folding are at the center of this culture of the imagination that in recent years has often been compared to forms in which images and texts are used in cyberspace. The seminar will deal with this topic from different angles. First, we will discuss rhetorical theories of the power of images and some theoretical approaches to baroque literature. Then we will analyze texts and images from the early modern period, especially visionary texts, baroque theater, poetry, and the art of emblems. Based on this and on the individual projects of the participants, we will investigate analogous structures of the uses of images and texts in cyberspace. This will include the question of how pre-enlightenment uses of images might help to understand postmodern imagination and the production of virtual worlds.CL 190:1

M. A. BernsteinAlthough we will be focusing primarily on James Joyce’s Ulysses, the archetypal modernist prose masterpiece, our real subject could be named more aptly, Modernism’s Epic Ambitions.  By reading Ulysses together as our proof-text, we will be able to explore a set of issues, both historical and theoretical, that are constituitive of high modernism, but whose specific family resemblance will only emerge as our discussion itself unfolds. Close attention will be paid to the ways in which other modernist artists, alongside Joyce, experimented with technical issues of form and structure, as well as with innovative uses of new thematic materials.Regular and active in class participation and a willingness to engage in copious reading are the principal prerequisites for the course.CL 190:1

Professor B. SpackmanThis course will examine a selection of travel narratives within the context of contemporary postcolonial theory and “mobility studies.”  Throughout the course, we will be acquainting ourselves with recent theoretical work on travel, Orientalism, and tourism.  Readings of primary texts will begin with a glance backward to Marco Polo’s thirteenth-century account of his travels to the East and Columbus’s account of what he thought was his voyage to the East, as well the early modern accounts of the voyages of discovery by Bartolome de Las Casas and Jean de Léry. We will then shift to a selection of modern travel narratives, both fictional and non-fictional.  Questions to be addressed include: the relation between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.   How does travel contribute to the construction of a place called “home,” and how might it disrupt that construction? What happens to Orientalist discourse when the Orientalist who enters and exits the harem happens to be a woman? What fantasy compels Europeans to find “cannibalism” in the East and the New World, over and over again? Authors read will include Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Bartolome de Las Casas, Jean de Léry, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Mark Twain, Xavier de Maistre, and Italo Calvino.  We will also read theoretical work by Said, Greenblatt, Culler, Kaplan, Pratt, Hulme, and others.CL 190:2

Popular environmentalist discourse is often portrayed as the province of misanthropes, lonely-hearts and “kill-joys,” whose “downer” ethics can only be articulated in the negative—as the demand to curb and curtail hedonistic consumption.   This course asks about the odd place of pleasure and desire in environmental literature broadly defined. What kinds of “romances” can be sustained with something called “nature” or with particular places or nonhuman others?  We will give special attention to stories that deviate from the dominant myth of an original fall from paradise and lost plenitude, and that reimagine ideas of normalcy, home, travel, and connection.  Drawing on the multiple senses of “queer,” from its contemporary usage as a term for same-sex sexual orientation to its older meanings (“odd,” “deviant,” “of questionable character,” “oblique”), we will compare different ways of breaking the normative yoking of sexuality to reproduction, of thinking the relation between “madness” and “civilization,” and of imagining alternative bases for community between humans and with other living beings.  We will also examine the surprising convergence of figures of secrecy, shame and lack—from “the gay closet” to the idea of nature as an “open secret”—in queer, gender and environmental studies.Readings by Abe, Bersani, Butler, Carson, Clare, Darwin, Erikson, Freud, Haraway, Kafka, Jewett, Malthus, Pollan, Rousseau, Sedgwick, Mary Shelley, Shepard, Spahr, Thoreau, de Vaca, Winnicott, William Wordsworth.Films by Herzog, Ang Lee, Varda, Wong Kar Wai.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Gretchen HeadResponding to the growing international circulation of literature in the early decades of the nineteenth century, Goethe declared, “The epoch of world literature is at hand, and everyone must strive to hasten its approach.” The term “world literature,” however, remains elusive and critics continue to grapple with David Damrosch’s question of, “which literature, whose world?” Gayatri Spivak has argued for the urgency of the active inclusion of the literatures of the Global South within the framework of world literature. In recognition of the importance of this project, the broad focus of this course will be to ask how the modern Arabic novel fits into this paradigm. Through readings of seminal texts by the Arabic tradition’s Mohamed Choukri (In Tangier, For Bread Alone) and Elias Khoury (Gate of the Sun, Yalo), French novelist and dramatist Jean Genet (The Thief’s Journal) and American author Paul Bowles (Let It Come Down), whose works were both significantly influenced by, and in turn influenced, modern Arabic fiction, and Hisham Matar (In the Country of Men, Anatomy of a Disappearance), a contemporary Libyan novelist who writes in English, we will address issues critical to current debates on world literature. We will consider the definition and role of cosmopolitanism; the writing of marginalization, trauma and aesthetic responses to systemic violence; the utility of Western critical theory in relation to non-Western literary traditions; the politics of translation and the negotiations that inevitably result from a work of literature’s reception into the space of a foreign culture; and, the global literary market, the limits it may impose on the author’s imagination and the possible international constraints under which literature from the periphery is now written. Critical readings will include essays and/or excerpts by Kwame Anthony Appiah, Mikhail Bakhtin, Walter Benjamin, Cathy Caruth, David Damrosch, Sigmund Freud, Nouri Gana, Richard Jacquemond, Abdelfattah Kilito, Claude Lévi-Straus, Samia Mehrez, Franco Moretti, Bruce Robbins, Gayatri Spivak, and Slavoj Žižek, in addition to selections from Paul Bowles’s letters and Jean Genet’s political writings.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor B. SpackmanThis course will examine a selection of travel narratives within the context of contemporary postcolonial theory and “mobility studies.”  Throughout the course, we will be acquainting ourselves with recent theoretical work on travel, Orientalism, and tourism.  Readings of primary texts will begin with a glance backward to Marco Polo’s thirteenth-century account of his travels to the East and Columbus’s account of what he thought was his voyage to the East, as well the early modern accounts of the voyages of discovery by Bartolome de Las Casas and Jean de Léry. We will then shift to a selection of modern travel narratives, both fictional and non-fictional.  Questions to be addressed include: the relation between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.   How does travel contribute to the construction of a place called “home,” and how might it disrupt that construction? What happens to Orientalist discourse when the Orientalist who enters and exits the harem happens to be a woman? What fantasy compels Europeans to find “cannibalism” in the East and the New World, over and over again? Authors read will include Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Bartolome de Las Casas, Jean de Léry, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Mark Twain, Xavier de Maistre, and Italo Calvino.  We will also read theoretical work by Said, Greenblatt, Culler, Kaplan, Pratt, Hulme, and others.

M. LuceyIn the masterful hands of Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust, the novel becomes an instrument for studying and for experiencing what it means to exist in the world and in time. Both Woolf and Proust saw the world around them changing rapidly – the world of the new twentieth century, increasingly global, a world of artistic revolution, of technological innovation, of political upheaval,  of rapid social change, of international warfare. They wrote novels as part of studying that change, as part of thinking about the experience of change itself, the effects of change on our ability to perceive the world we live in.  In turn, their novels changed how people thought about and read novels. Some would say their novels contributed to changing our ability to see the new world around us. The novels of Woolf and Proust (Woolf, in fact, was an admiring reader of Proust) are now thought of as some of the most inventive, challenging, and influential novels ever written.  In this course we will explore Woolf and Proust’s aesthetic, philosophical, historical, and sociological experiments within the form of the novel.  We’ll read four novels by Woolf, part or all of four of the volumes of Proust’s seven-volume masterpiece, In Search of Lost Time, along with a few of their essays and a few essays by other writers.Marcel Proust, Swann’s Way, In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, Sodom and Gomorrah, Finding Time Again  (We will be reading the Penguin translations, series editor Christopher Prendergast.)Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, The Years

Professor Niklaus Largier‘Modernism’ refers to a range of literary texts, music, and other media that have changed and revolutionized the intellectual and cultural landscape at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. In all areas, traditional forms were replaced by new, innovative, and  experimental forms of cultural production. This happened in response to processes of industrialization, urbanization, and social challenges. Often, this progressive reinvention of the arts has been closely linked to the experience of the First World War and to revolutionary movements. In this course we will explore the different aspects of Modernism. A course reader will include French, German, Russian, Italian, and English texts.

Professor Robert KaufmanThis seminar is an introduction to graduate study in Comparative Literature for incoming Comparative Literature Ph.D. students. Our readings and discussions will attempt to at least begin a formal, critical-theoretical, and historical overview—including considerations of influential critiques of the discipline—of Comparative Literature.  Along the way, we’ll look at developing notions of how scholars, critics, and literary historians (not to mention artists) have understood terms like text, form, genre, history, culture, theory, criticism, methodology, and, of course, literature and comparison themselves. We’ll read classical and revisionist works in literary history, critical theory, and comparatist analysis, ranging from contributions by Herder, de Stäel, and Goethe, to Auerbach, Lukács, Wellek, Paz, Glissant, Said, Spivak, and others, while also treating the legacies and contestations of Anglo-American New Critical formalism, along with parallel developments in Russian Foramlism, psychoanalysis, strucuturalism, and postructuralism, as well as a somewhat later emergence and reception of criticism and theory focused on feminism, gender, sexuality, and queer theory; postcolonial critique, new historicism and cultural materialism, and varieties of marxian and neo-marxian critique; and the burgeoning field of affect theory. Our seminar will be coordinated with Comparative Literature 201, the Comparative Literature proseminar for incoming Ph.D. students. Students will make one 10-15 minute questions-presentation (designed to spur discussion of the day’s readings), and will write a seminar paper of about 20 pages (due at semester’s end) which will comparatively engage two literary and/or cultural texts of their own choosing in relation to two or three of the critical/theoretical approaches we’ve studied.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

What special features of slaves and servants might authors be drawn to when they make them narrators or use them to move the plot along?This course offers a case study in the complex interplay between literature and social structure by focusing on the roles that slaves and servants play in texts from several literary cultures and periods. We will be reading literary texts with an eye to what they tell us about the social assumptions that govern relations between people of different status, but also exploring the ways that texts use images of slaves and servants to express themes such as individual autonomy, intimacy and attitudes toward the body. The required readings will come primarily from three broad historical periods (classical Greece and Rome, Renaissance Europe and the nineteenth- and twentieth-century U.S. and Britain) and will include plays, novels, poems, films and philosophical essays. We will work on close textual analysis and also on understanding literary texts in light of their historical contexts.

His plays depict the psychological, political, economic, and social upheavals that mark the transition from the pre-modern world to a world that is recognizably our own. But he is also the most international of all writers. This course will explore Shakespeare’s extraordinary literary originality by studying his most influential plays in an international context. We will locate Shakespeare in the culture of his period by reading his plays in dialogue with masterworks from across Renaissance Europe. We will consider how he and his contemporaries engage with issues of international scope at a time (like our own) of extraordinary political, religious, and economic turmoil. We will read eight major plays by Shakespeare, as well as works by Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Cervantes, Erasmus, and Petrarch. This course thus offers an introduction to early modern Europe, an exercise in reading literature in an international context, and an in-depth study of a major author.Reading List:Shakespeare-Plays

Professor Chana KronfeldThis seminar will focus on lyrical poetry produced in the margins – or outside — of the modern Anglo-European canon in order to call into question static typological theories of genre, as well as the majoritarian, heteronormative or Eurocentric set of biases behind contemporary attacks on the lyric as solipsistic, apolitical “personal expression.” Participants will draw on their own cultural and linguistic specialties to help us compile a multi-lingual course Reader of modern lyrical poetry decentered by ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, class, place or language. My own contribution to the readings will include selections from modern Yiddish and Hebrew poetry, and examples of biblical poetry as an alternative model for the lyric, in which the very distinction between the personal and the collective, the political and the “apolitical” is rendered meaningless. Through a series of historically and linguistically informed close readings, we will examine both standard and non-normative theoretical studies of the lyric, maintaining a critical awareness of the extent to which our paradigm examples affect our understanding of the genre. Questions we may want to ask include: How does the view from the margins problematize such western commonplaces as the coherence and authority of the lyrical “I,” the subject-object divide, the dichotomy between apostrophe and address, the conflation of the “lyrical” and “subjective” with the “feminine,” or the lyric’s purported freedom — or flight! — from the historical and the social?Reading List:The Lyric Theory Reader: A Critical Anthology, edited by Virginia Jackson and Yopi Prins (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2014)Course Reader (to include Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Jacob Blevins, Jonathan Culler, Benjamin Harshav, Virginia Jackson, Barbara Johnson, Roman Jakobson, Robert Kaufman, Will Waters, Rene Wellek and selections by seminar participants)Selections from: The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse (bilingual anthology), eds.

R. Kaufman (This course also serves as an elective for the Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory)The German Bertolt Brecht, the Peruvian César Vallejo, and the American Louis Zukofsky exert–within their lifetimes, and in their posthumous reception to this day–special influence on experimental-modernist and Marxian (as well as broader Left) traditions of poetry, poetics, and criticism. Like many artists who come of age early in the 20th century, these poets effectively begin their careers with romantic and symbolist poetics all but second nature to them; they proceed to adopt and extend “advanced” formal and thematic experimentation as intended critique, radicalization, and modernization of romanticism and symbolism themselves, and as an intended contribution towards the development of modern poetry’s capacities dynamically to engage, from the Left, a dramatically altered social landscape.In sustained readings of these writers’ poetry and criticism (and with some attention to their work outside poetry), this seminar will invite response to many aspects of the poetic art under study, while highlighting the consideration of what seems or doesn’t seem particularly marxian–or for that matter, particularly Left–in the poetry. These poets’ formidable imaginative energies and intellectual reach; their terrific feel for how to work with and stretch inherited poetic forms and genres; their singular formal-technical innovations at the level of line, syntax, phrase, syllable, accent, and even phoneme; their virtuosic abilities with traditional and novel orchestrations of lyric musicality; and just their sheer overall poetic talent and ambition will allow us to see, among other things, how their rigorous investigations and enactments–in verse and criticism–of the compound question “what is poetry, what is aesthetic experience, what is modernism, what is marxism, what might–or should, or should not–bring them all together?” will yield intriguing, often unexpected results (and not only in terms of the relationships obtaining in modern poetry among pleasure, estrangement, judgment, form, structure, genre, aesthetic autonomy, sociohistorical content, and ethical-political commitment).In addition to their own poetry, we will read poems by some of Brecht’s, Vallejo’s, and Zukfosky’s precursors, colleagues, and heirs; and we will spend considerable time evaluating the national–and, perhaps especially, the international or supra-national–claims made by and for the three poets’ work, including claims about the bridges they wished to help construct (not least, among the literary-artistic-political cultures of Germany and the rest of Europe, Latin America, and the United States). We will in addition read–trying to work out our own interpretations while seeking as well to reconstruct the interpretations made (and then presumably put artistically into motion) by Brecht, Vallejo, and Zukofsky themselves–those marxian writings that most influenced the three poets; this will above all mean the canonical writings of Marx and Engels, but also some key works of Karl Korsch, Walter Benjamin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, José Carlos Mariátegui, John Reed, and Sidney Finkelstein. The ways that Brecht’s, Vallejo’s, and Zukofsky’s poems appear finally to grasp or transform these 19th and 20th century marxian texts may prove telling, not only vis-à-vis modern poetry and marxism, but also with regard to this particular poetry’s German-European, Peruvian-Latin American, and American character.(Note: We will read Brecht’s and Vallejo’s poetry in English translation, though we will frequently refer to the original German or Spanish texts of the facing-page editions that have been ordered; knowledge of German and/or Spanish, while not required, will of course be helpful.)

Professor Anne-Lise FrancoisThis comparative seminar in lyric poetry borrows its title from Susan Stewart’s Poetry and the Fate of the Senses (University of Chicago Press, 2002), to ask about the relation between poetry and sensory deprivation (or plenitude) and prosthesis. We will focus on early modern to twentieth-century poetry written in English, French, German, Italian and Japanese, in the age of print culture or what will later become, in Walter Benjamin’s terms, the “age of mechanical reproducibility.” From the emergence of “haiku” out of haikai no renga (comic linked verse) to modernism’s fascination with isolated images, the course will give some attention to the “lyricization” of poetry—the privileging of isolated, individual, brief forms abstracted from once collective practices—as well as to the changing roles—messianic, consolatory, critical, representative—assigned the figure of the “solitary” poet and “autonomous” work of art in the context of industrial capitalism, the rationalization of time and space, and European colonialism. We will also ask about “the fate of the senses” in relation to contemporary ecological crisis and, in particular, to the paradox of simultaneous sensory impoverishment and perpetual stimulation.Most crucially, however, we will want to ask what happens when we read poetry as a series of substitutions (touch for sight, and sound for touch) and read together poets who, pushing the limits of language as an expressive medium, interrogate the relations of the verbal to the visual and musical arts, of visionary experience to sensory perception, of memory to imagination, and of language to the natural world and/or phenomenal experience. Tracing the meeting of stone and flesh, of the carnal and the transcendent, the transient and eternal, we will compare recurring figures of poetry as the only remaining sign of otherwise irrecoverable, lost, fugitive experiences.Poems by Petrarch, Shakespeare, Herbert, Milton, Bashō, Buson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Dickinson, Hardy, Rilke, Valéry, Stevens, Niedecker, Rankine; primary readings will also be determined by special interests of students. Secondary readings by Adorno, Benjamin, Culler, Jackson, Barbara Johnson, Lessing, Krieger, Prins, Stewart, among others.The one required text will be Susan Stewart’s Fate of the Senses, ordered at University Press Books.Interested students are encouraged to purchase used editions of individual poets and/or reliable anthologies. Assigned poems will be available on the course website.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

K. McCarthyThis seminar will take up the intersections of lyric and history in two different ways. First, we will investigate the history of the lyric genre and consider both the continuities and discontinuities within what has been labeled “lyric” in different periods, literatures, cultures. What are the advantages and disadvantages of thinking of these disparate forms as manifestations of a common genre? Second, we will be examining the contexts in which lyric has been produced and circulated at any given historical moment — how do factors such as educational practice, orality, musical accompaniment, performance, printing, canonization, etc. affect the way lyric looks and sounds? These two sets of questions are not independent and throughout the semester we will be working on both tracks simultaneously. The selection of readings will include some classical Latin and Greek and some examples of English and Italian Renaissance sonnets. Other periods, languages and sub-genres will be chosen on the basis of student interests.CL 202B:1

Professor Chana KronfeldThis seminar will focus on lyrical poetry produced in the margins – or outside of — the modern Anglo-European canon in order to call into question static typological theories of genre, as well as what may be a majoritarian, heteronormative or Eurocentric set of biases behind contemporary attacks on the lyric as solipsistic, apolitical “personal expression.” Participants will draw on their own cultural and linguistic specialties to compile a multi-lingual course Reader of modern lyrical poetry marginalized by gender, sexuality, class, race, place or language. My own contribution to the readings will include selections from bilingual anthologies of Yiddish and Hebrew poetry, and examples of biblical poetry as an alternative model of the lyric, in which the distinction between the personal and the collective, the political and the “apolitical” is rendered meaningless. Through a series of historically and linguistically informed close readings, we will examine both standard and non-normative theoretical studies of the lyric, maintaining a critical awareness of the extent to which our paradigm examples affect our understanding of the genre. Questions we may want to ask include: How does the view from the margins problematize such western commonplaces as the coherence and authority of the lyrical “I,” the subject-object divide, the dichotomy between apostrophe and address, the conflation of the “lyrical” and “subjective” with the “feminine,” or the lyric’s purported freedom — or flight! — from the historical and the social?Requirements: The seminar group will compile a Reader of modern lyrics as well as cultural and theoretical background materials relevant for the participants’ different languages of specialization. 1 in-class presentation and 1 seminar paper. COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS WILL BE ENCOURAGED.Reading List:1. Selections from: The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse (bilingual anthology), eds. Irving Howe, Ruth R. Wisse & Khone Shemruk. New York: Penguin, 1988. (Out of print; photocopy available at Instant Copying and Laser Printing).2. The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai, trans.

Professor Chana KronfeldIn this seminar we will explore developments in the field of translation studies that have taken it beyond the once common metaphors of fidelity and betrayal, of being faithful or unfaithful to the “original.”  We’ll focus on (mis)translations as symptomatic of the poetic and political dynamics of the negotiations between cultures in a particular historical moment. We’ll discuss a variety of approaches to the theory of translation, from system theory to postcolonial and globalization studies, both by reading critically and by theorizing from the translation practice itself. Central issues will include the role of translation in the construction of national and transnational literary histories, (un)equal power relations in the ciruculation between source and target text, recovering the role of agency in translation, and translation as intertextual practice.Participants will experiment with collaborative translations of poetry from “their” language(s) and provide a comparative critical analysis of the poetics and politics implicit in influential translation projects in these languages.  The modernist poetry of Anna Margolin (1887 Belarus-1952 New York) in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition will serve as our anchor, providing both a case study and an alternative model for theorizing translation “from the margins.”Students will contribute to a seminar Reader, work in small groups and present their translation and critical process to the seminar.  Collaborative oral and written projects will be encouraged.  Seminar paper: an annotated translation project with theoretical and historical introduction.READING LIST:1)      Lawrence Venuti, The Translation Studies Reader, London& N.Y.: Routledge, 2012 (3rd edition; paperback)2)      Selections from: Tejaswini Niranjana, Siting Translation: History, Post-Structuralism, and the Colonial Context, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992 (out of print; to be included in Course Reader).3)      Anna Margolin, Drunk from the Bitter Truth, trans. and ed., Shirley Kumove (Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 2005).4)      Course Reader (available from Instant Copying and Laser Printing, 2138 University Ave., 4th week of classes).  The Reader will include student contributions, as well as extensive selections from Andre Lefevere, Translation, Rewriting, and the Manipulation of Literary Fame (out of print), and articles by Emily Apter, Susan Bernofsky, Sacvan Bercovitch, Homi Bhaba, Anuradha Dingwaney, Barbara Johnson,  Lydia Liu, Naomi Seidman, Mashweta Sengupta and others. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Frank BeznerThis course is meant as a comparative exploration of (mostly) Latin Medieval texts that deal with the topic of love and desire – a poorly studied genre that is still in search of valuable conceptual models able to address its complex aesthetics; negotiation of related discourses (such as medicine and philosophy); and relation to the institutional, social, and political constellations from which it emerged.Our course is thus basically meant as a critical laboratory in which we willAs indicated by the title of the course, we will pay particular attention to the construction of subjectivity and interiority in and by our texts: a question that we will less pursue in terms of an emphatic concept of a “consciousness of the self” (Morris, Benton, Moser) than against the backdrop of those normative practices, political agendas, and institutional dynamics that created the inner space of interiority. By creating literary ego-subjects, we will argue, medieval Latin literary texts negotiate both the normative pressure faced by clerics in the 11th/12th century and, on a more fundamental level, the anthropological implications related to the concept of an inner space constructed as a realm of self-control and self-discipline directed at one’s own sexuality.Texts to be read include: love poems from the Carmina Burana; the correspondence of Abelard and Heloise; the so-called ‘Loire Poets’ (Baudri of Bourgeuil, Marbod of Rennes); Peter of Blois; the autobiography of Guibert of Nogent; German Minnesang; Troubadour poetry.All texts will be made available in the original and in reliable translations. Knowledge of the Latin language is strongly recommended. The course is open to students from all medieval disciplines including ‘modernists’ who want to explore unfamiliar pre-modern terrain. The course will also be responsive to students’ interests and suggestions.  We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Professor Frank BeznerMuch has been written on Ancient, Medieval and Early Modern vernacular love poetry, and the rich scholarly criticism on Latin love elegy, Troubadour lyrics, German Minnesang, or Petrarcism ranges from more traditional philological, literary, and formalist approaches to fascinating uses of gender criticism and psychoanalytic thought.  Much less critical light, however, has been shed on the Medieval Latin side – i.e. on the prolific and somewhat implausible production of learned love lyrics and related prose texts that were written during the 11th to 13th centuries all over Medieval Europe.In this course we will study this neglected and intriguing tradition by reading and analyzing known and unknown authors/texts such as Peter Abelard, Baudri of Bourgeuil, and Peter of Blois; poems from the Carmina Burana and the Arundel collection of Latin lyrics; and other related works by Andreas Capellanus, Alan of Lille, and others. Overall, the course hopes to become an intellectual laboratory, in which we develop reading strategies and critical concepts for these texts: How do medieval Latin love poems function as literary works? How do they interact with classical intertexts (esp. Ovid)? What is their relationship to the rich and complex institutional, political, intellectual and social environment in which they originate (esp. the Church reform movement and the “Renaissance of the Twelfth Century”)? What springs from a close comparison with vernacular texts and the critical traditions around them: marked difference, unexpected similarities, or even common ground? And, finally, why were some Medieval Latin poems so attractive to modernist poets such as Charles Baudelaire?Although the course has a specific topic, it can be understood (or attended), in a more general sense, as a graduate-level introduction into the literary culture of the Latin Middle Ages: graduate students will be given the opportunity to study the aesthetic, material, discursive, institutional, and cultural dynamics of Latin literature written during one of the most vibrant phases of medieval literary history, the so-called “Renaissance of the Twelfth Century”.All texts will be made available in the Latin original and in reliable translations; knowledge of Latin remains, however, a requirement. Students from all disciplinary backgrounds are welcome and the course can be taken as fulfillment of the Medieval Studies Medieval Latin requirement.

F. BeznerMuch has been written on medieval and early modern vernacular love poetry – and the many approaches that have been developed for the understanding of Troubadour lyrics, German Minnesang, or Petrarcism, can be seen as an indicator of the past and present state of medieval literary studies in general (think of “courtly love”, formalist studies, “fictionality in Minnesang”, Lacanianism, or the new emphasis on manuscript contexts).Much less light has ben shed on the Latin side – i.e. on the prolific production of learned love poetry and lyrics since the second half of the 11th century. In this course we will study this comparatively neglected side, and read texts and authors as Baudri of Bourgeuil, Marbod of Rennes, Hildebert of Lavardin and Peter of Blois; poems from the Carmina Burana and the Arundel collection of Latin lyrics; and related texts by Andreas Capellanus, Alan of Lille, and Dante. (If students are interested, we may also include some later (neo-Latin) authors as Johannes Secundus).Overall, the course hopes to become an intellectual laboratory, in which we develop reading strategies and critical concepts for these texts and authors: how do medieval Latin love poems function as literary works? How do they interact with their classical intertexts (esp. Ovid)? What is their relationship to the rich and complex cultural intellectual and social environment in which they originated, esp. the (so-called) ‘Renaissance of the Twelfth Century’?

F. Bezner“To say one thing, to mean another”: allegory, allegorical exegesis, and allegorical literature are omnipresent in the history of Western literature and thought – and often reduced to a single (or simple) dynamics. But this simplicity is deceptive: the “allegorical mode” is protean, always in transit, and entails many – literary, cultural, and theoretical – complexities.Allegory turns texts into repositories of thought – or purge them from their literary elements; it can be used to formulate simple moralistic messages or create the most speculative philosophies; it may imply a conception of philosophy-in-fiction (and vice versa) or undermine any idea of stable philosophical truth; it helps to communicate to different levels of audience, to integrate, or excludes those in the know from the unenlightened; it turns exegetes into self-proclaimed prophets or can be condemned as arbitrary…This challenging complexity is at the centre of this course. Its aim is not to find “the formula” to understand allegory, but  to discuss and develop critical strategies how to deal with selected – known and less known – pre-modern cultural, intellectual, literary constellations, in which allegory, allegoresis, and allegorizing literature played an important role, among them: Neoplatonic and Stoic conceptions of allegory and allegoresis, Christian allegory (Augustine, Origen, Prudentius; Bernard of Clairvaux), the “Twelfth-Century Renaissance” (Bernard Silvester, Alan of Lille) and its vernacular reception (Roman de la Rose; Gottfried of Strassburg, Tristan; Frauenlob; Dante), and Early Modern negotiations of allegory. We will also read some modern responses to pre-modern allegory that became constitutive for the construction of modernity (Goethe, Benjamin, de Man).For all texts to be read English translations are available, however knowledge of Latin and one of the other languages (German, Greek, French) is strongly recommended. Students will be responsible for one in-class presentation, a short intervention (e.g. a comparison) and a research project culminating in a paper (15-20pp) due one week before the end of the course.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Christopher DavisThe poets known as the troubadour flourished in the South of France during the twelfth century; however, their poems had a vibrant afterlife, circulating in a variety of forms, both musical and textual, and shaping the development of subsequent European literatures. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the Occitan language and to the major poets, forms and movements that characterize the troubadour “tradition.” Among the works we will read are lyric poems by Bernart de Ventadorn, Arnaut Daniel and Bertran de Born, the parodic romance Flamenca, and the groundbreaking greammatical treatise of Raimon Vidal. We will also study authors such as Dante and Ausias March who were influenced by the troubadours and in turn played a role in defining their tradition. Special attention will be given to issues of orality and textuality, medieval language theory, manuscript studies and the emergence of regional languages and literatures. Readings will be in English, French and Occitan.

Professor V. KahnThe history of Western literary theory is often told in terms of the concept of mimesis. But there is another, equally powerful, anti-mimetic strand to this history, and that is the critique of mimesis as a form of idolatry. In this course, we will explore this critique from the prohibition against images in the Hebrew bible up through modern attacks on mimesis as inherently ideological. Our main literary texts will be taken from Plato, the Hebrew Bible, Tertullian and Reformation England (especially Marlowe, Bacon, and Milton), when there was a fierce debate about the harmful power of images and the necessity of iconoclasm. But we will also discuss the afterlife of iconoclasm in Kant, Marx, Freud, Benjamin, Baudrillard, and Althusser . Students whose interests lie primarily in other national literatures are welcome, and may write their final papers on primary texts not discussed in class, though they must engage the theoretical texts assigned for the seminar.CL 215

Profs. Albert R. Ascoli and Timothy Hampton Also offered as Italian Studies 215 (4 units only)  SEMINAR IN RENAISSANCE LITERATURE AND CULTURE   The period that we now (usually) call the Renaissance saw the emergence of the modern “national” vernacular languages and literatures as vehicles of “high culture” and socio-political institutions.  It also witnessed a movement, usually known as humanism, dedicated to the recovery, study, and appropriation of the ancient languages—first “classical” Latin (as against the ecclesiastical idiom that had emerged over the course of the middle ages), then Greek, eventually Hebrew, “Chalcydean,” and other tongues. The problem of language in the Renaissance touches every aspect of life: the relations between the social classes, the interactions between Church and an increasingly prominent “secular” domain, the discourse of nationhood and ethnic identity, the encounters—imperializing, missionary, or otherwise—with non-European populations, and so on and on. In this course we will introduce the question of Renaissance multilingualism as it emerges historically (from Dante’s early defense, in Latin, of the “illustrious vernacular” as political and poetic language to the contemptuous ‘push-back’ of Latin humanism, to the emergence of prestige vernacular literatures—still modeled on the classics—in the sixteenth century); as it affects different geographical areas differently, while constituting the vehicle of communication between them (most notably, Italy, France, Spain, England, Germany); and as it permeates the most fundamental aspects of individual and collective life (religion; law; colonialism; class-relations; court-culture; and so on and on). At the heart of the course throughout will be the encounters among multiple languages within the experience and writing of key individuals and groups.  We will be interested, not only in the literary implications for major writers of the new linguistic multiplicity that haunts the Renaissance, but also in the institutions and agents that help shape the emergence of linguistic variety–copyists, printers, ambassadors, mariners, vagabonds. Among the authors whom we might consider, depending on the makeup of the group and the contours of our discussions, will be: Dante, Petrarch, St. Catherine,  Alberti, Ariosto, Machiavelli, Rabelais,  Du Bellay, Garcilaso, Luther, Wyatt, Montaigne, Shakespeare, and Cervantes Course Conducted in English Reading Knowledge of Italian, French, Spanish, or Latin desirableCourse Requirements: Students are expected to attend and participate regularly.  There will be occasional in-class presentations and some shorter writing assignments.  The principal assignment for the course is a research paper of ca. 6000 words (20-25 pages), an advanced draft of which will be presented to the seminar during the final weeks of the semester.  Topics must be closely related to the concerns of the course although they may focus on authors, texts and issues not directly treated in seminar.

Professor Barbara SpackmanAs a literary movement, “Decadence” came into existence by means of an act of cultural re-signification; taking up an epithet meant as an insult, Anatole Baju transformed “decadence” into a rallying cry.  This course will mime this inaugural gesture by grouping together a number of fin-de-siècle (for the most part) writers and intellectuals (including Freud and the sexologists) whose works are, we will suggest, the locus of a series of cultural re-significations.  In particular, we will look at the ways in which norms constraining and defining genders, sexualities, and literary, political, and aesthetic practices are tested and transformed in works by Charles Baudelaire, J.K. Huysmans, Georges Rodenbach, Octave Mirbeau, Leopold von Sacher Masoch, Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater, Havelock Ellis, Gabriele D’Annunzio, Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer, and Rachilde.

Irina Paperno and Eric NaimanIn this seminar, we will read several major 19th and 20th century novels written in French, Russian and English. Central to our discussions will be the methodological question of the link (or gap) between close reading and cultural context, and we will combine attention to narrative and rhetoric with consideration of the novel’s involvement with epistemological, psychological and social issues (such as subjectivity, or consciousness, temporality, sexuality, body, family, crime) that fall into the domain of specialized disciplines and institution (such as psychology, or psychoanalysis, philosophy, law, religion, medicine).  Some works will be discussed in class; others explored by students in individual projects. Our hope is that in addition to providing the opportunity to study several complex and influential novels, this course will be useful to students in their research and pedagogical practice, which, as of recent years, is frequently of inter/crossdisciplinary nature.Key texts:Flaubert, Madame Bovary (1856)

Eric NaimanA semester-long seminar devoted to the works of Vladimir Nabokov.  (Works originally written in Russian will be read in English with the possibility of an additional time for discussion of the Russian texts).  Focus will be on Nabokov’s place in the Russian and American literary traditions, the nexus between sexual desire and interpretation, Nabokov and close reading, applied Nabokov studies.  While our focus will be mostly on Nabokov’s novels, we will also devote some time to his short stories, criticism and, perhaps, letters.   Members of the seminar will write a final paper, make one or two presentations and occasionally lead (or at least instigate) seminar discussions.

R. Kaufman[Note: Although this seminar emphasizes the importance of nineteenth and twentieth-century poetry and poetics to the development of Frankfurt School aesthetics, criticism, and theory, and likewise considers more recent dialogues between later twentieth and  twentieth-first-century poetry/poetics and Frankfurt-oriented criticism, the seminar is also cross-listed as a Critical Theory 205 “Frankfurt School” Core-Curriculum Course (for students enrolled in the Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory). Whether enrolled through Comparative Literature, or through the Critical Theory Program, students not focused on poetry in their Ph.D. studies are nonetheless welcome to take the seminar as a survey of some major texts in Frankfurt aesthetic, literary, and cultural theory more generally, provided they are willing actively to study and engage with the modern poetry and poetics that will be treated as the seminar’s primary literary field.]
Readings in modern, and above all modern lyric, poetry (much of it from the U.S., but also from Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Near East) in relation to major Frankfurt-School texts on aesthetics, criticism, and social theory that emphasize the significance of literature (as well as the other arts) and especially poetry. Focused concentration on the writings of Walter Benjamin and Theodor W. Adorno, and on their development of Kantian, Hegelian, and Marxian traditions of aesthetics and critical theory. Sustained attention to how and why poetry turns out to be so crucial to the Frankfurters’ (and, in particular, to Benjamin’s and Adorno’s) overall analyses of modernity, mechanical/ technical/ technological reproduction and reproducibility (in both the socioeconomic and artistic-aesthetic spheres), and critical agency. Consideration of how Frankfurt-School concerns and legacies might engage the changed sociopolitical circumstances and artistic-aesthetic tendencies­-and the changed poetry­-of the last three decades; analysis in turn of how later-modernist and contemporary poets’ work may challenge Frankfurt analyses of and assumptions about poetry, aesthetic experience, and critical agency themselves. Tracing of the poetry, aesthetics, critical-theory, and sociopolitical histories leading to Adorno’s controversial statements from the late 1940s through 1969 about “Poetry After Auschwitz” (including the ceaseless, prominent international debates those statements caused and have continued to occasion in the poetry-world, the other arts, criticism, and the cultural sphere more generally). Readings of poetry throughout the course will tend to emphasize formal, stylistic, and philosophical-theoretical matters in order to highlight the question of how–and to what degree–artistic technique, in relation to aesthetic form and aesthetic experience (especially lyric experience), may offer stimulus toward and insight into historical, sociopolitical, and ethical understanding and engagement. Some treatment of Romantic and nineteenth-century poetry, and of 21st-century poetry, but the seminar will focus primarily on twentieth-century, modernist poetry (including modernist poetry written and published during the apparently postmodern period). As a shared project throughout the semester, the class will read and continue discussing together in a sustained manner two volumes of poetry: a facing-page, French-English volume containing Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal [1857] and Le Spleen de Paris/Petits Poèmes en Prose [1869]; and Michael Palmer’s Sun [1988]), while, for each week’s class, students and/or the instructor also will have distributed ahead of time xeroxed and/or PDF’d texts of work by other poets (whom they have will have chosen to present to, and discuss with, the rest of the class). Along with ordered books (which can be purchased at the ASUC Bookstore), xeroxed and/or PDF’d texts will feature additional selections from Kant, Hegel, Marx, Vallejo, Duncan, Benjamin, Adorno, Marcuse, Sartre, Beauvoir, Brecht, Mayakovsky, Ponge, Neruda, Zurita, Celan, various Surrealist and Objectivist poets, WC Williams, Moore, Bishop, Stevens, Paz, Olson, Levertov, Duncan, Rich, and many others.[Additional Note: Texts of critical theory, philosophy, aesthetics, and/or criticism will be presented in English translation, though, with texts not initially written in English, we will frequently consider the German, French, Spanish, etc., originals.  Poetry not originally composed in English will be read and discussed primarily in English translation, though we will almost always also consult a poem’s facing-page (or at-hand-xeroxed) original language–most often German, French, or Spanish (as well as other languages, depending on students’ poetry selections). Knowledge of other languages–especially German, French, and/or Spanish­-is not required, though it will prove very helpful.]We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Erica WeitzmanThis course will offer an overview of the fundamentals of irony and its theoretization from Socrates to the present day. We will examine the history of irony in all its permutations, as well as the various positions irony occupies within rhetoric, ontology, aesthetics, politics, and literary theory.  Above all, we will ask the question of why the seemingly simple matter of irony proves to be such a tenacious problem in Western thought, and why it continues to be a topic of debate and controversy (including repeated calls for and announcements of its “end”) up to today. Readings will include works by Plato, Schlegel, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Baudelaire, Benjamin, de Man, Deleuze, Derrida, Rorty, and Butler, as well as literary texts by Flaubert, Walser, Mann, and others.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

K. BrittoIn this course we will consider a variety of written (and one or two cinematic) narratives, largely produced in the last decades of the twentieth century, all of which foreground the movement of individuals or communities across cultural, linguistic, and national borders.  In dialogue with a selection of theoretical texts, we will discuss a series of interrelated questions, including but not limited to the following: how do “dislocated” narratives attempt to come to terms with the historical ruptures and geographic displacements brought about by the experience of transnational movement?  How do they seek to render into language and narrative form the confusion of conflicting cultural structures?  How do their authors represent bodies as objects that circulate within transnational circuits, variously commodified, eroticized, or pathologized, and variously situated in relation to legal frameworks of recognition?  How are categories of gender and sexuality inflected by displaced histories?  What investments do these narratives have in body parts and transplanted organs, in ghosts and zombies?  In our discussions, we will consider the specificity of each text while remaining open to insights made possible by reading comparatively, paying particular attention to common textual strategies, formal elements, and practices of representation.  Readings will be in French and English, and texts considered will include the following: Ousmane Sembène, “La Noire de…”; Ken Bugul, Le Baobab fou; Alain Mabanckou, Bleu-Blanc-Rouge; Fatou Diome, Le Ventre de l’Atlantique; Gisèle Pineau, L’Exil selon Julia; Jamaica Kincaid, Lucy; Edwidge Danticat, Breath, Eyes, Memory; lê thi diem thúy, The Gangster We Are All Looking For; Azouz Begag, Le gone du Chaâba; Farida Belghoul, Georgette!; Malika Mokeddem, L’Interdite; Stephen Frears, Dirty Pretty Things.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Karl BrittoIn this course, we will read a number of texts that offer striking representations of bodies formed by a wide variety of colonial, neocolonial, and postcolonial contexts.  Our readings will allow us to consider a series of interrelated questions: how do these texts engage with and/or contest practices of racist classification and exoticist representation?  In what ways do their authors foreground bodies as texts upon which are written histories of political and cultural violence?  What links can be traced between bodies, language, and narrative?  How do bodies serve to authenticate and/or trouble imagined national communities?  In our discussions, we will bear in mind the historical specificity of each text while remaining open to insights made possible by reading comparatively.  In other words, our goal will not be to synthesize a monolithic theory of the body in colonial and postcolonial literature but rather to analyze individual texts while attempting to be attentive to common textual strategies, formal elements, and practices of representation.  In addition to selected secondary material, readings will likely include: Jehan Cendrieux, François Phuoc, métis, Kim Lefèvre, Métisse blanche, Frantz Fanon, Peau noire, masques blancs, Mayotte Capécia, Je suis Martiniquaise, Maryse Condé, Hérémakhonon, Ferdinand Oyono, Le vieux nègre et la médaille, Sony Labou Tansi, La vie et demie, Salman Rushdie, Midnight’s Children, Bapsi Sidhwa, Cracking India, Bessora, 53 cm.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

G. HeadWith the pre-Islamic ode’s evocation of the past figured through the space of the abandoned campsite, place is a central organizing trope from the earliest poems of the Arabic literary canon onward. The Meccan surahs of the Qur’an are inextricably linked to the landscape of the desert.  As the modern novel rises in Egypt, the pastoral and narratives of urban dystopia are connected to larger frames of nationalist and ideological discourse. The rapid urbanization brought by the oil industry catalyzes new novelistic forms from Libya to the Gulf. In line with Franco Moretti’s assertion that geography is an active force that shapes both the wider literary field and discrete narrative structures, this course will address the issue of space in Arabic literature and the Arabic literary text’s position in historical space. Primary readings will include al-Hamadhani, al-Saraqusti, Ibn Khaldoun, Abdelrahman Munif, Yahya Taher Abdallah, Idris Ali, Hassouna Mosbahi, Ibrahim al-Koni, and Mahmoud Darwish with critical readings taken from spatial theory, cultural geography, urban studies and ecocriticism. In keeping with this course’s concern for the intersection of geography and text, students will produce their own mapped visualization of a text(s) which will form the basis for analysis in their final papers.  We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Naomi SeidmanThe modern era saw an explosion of philosophical (as well as scientific) attempts to understand time as well as poetic and novelistic experimentations with what could be called “literary time.” Literary theorists, working at the intersection of these fields, incorporated both literary and philosophical notions of time in their approaches to literary transmission, plot as a means of organizing time, and varieties of literary temporalities. This course will explore these philosophical, literary and theoretical temporalities, reading modernity through new philosophies of duration, experimental literary modalities of time. Readings include Bergson, Husserl, Heidegger, Benjamin, Bakhtin, Edelman, Kafka, and a selection of Yiddish poetry; students will also contribute to the syllabus.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professors Mia Fuller (Italian Studies) and Harsha Ram (Slavic Languages and Literatures, Comparative Literature)Literature and urban civilization have long been intimately connected. Our seminar seeks to explore their connection as it relates to the emergence and global spread of the modern and contemporary city. How has the spatial and social organization of the modern city informed the thematic and formal choices writers make? And how, in turn, have the imaginative projections of literary texts shaped our experience of the city, its emancipatory potential and its alienating constraints? How exactly do cities get not merely mapped but also emplotted? What kinds of urban spaces and city-dwellers become the privileged focus of modern fiction and poetry? How do the density and scale of the urban built environment impinge on the way writers view the world and tell their stories? What genres seem best suited to rendering urban life? Is the city the defining context of modern literature or its implicit if barely human hero? To what extent is the global diffusion of the novel form related to the growth of urbanization?Our seminar will read texts written over two centuries located in Paris, St. Petersburg, Cairo, Mexico City and Lahore. Our authors will be Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, Louis Aragon, Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Andrei Bely, Naguib Mahfouz, Carlos Fuentes, Roberto Bolaño and Mohsin Hamid. We will relate the rise of literary realism and modernism to the aesthetic and cognitive challenges posed by city life. We will retrace the familiar story of Paris as the cradle of urban modernity but also complicate that story as we move beyond the West to Latin America and the Islamic world. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

We begin with the stories and cinema “before” (Eastern Europe before WWII), and study theories, historiographies, and modes of testimony by survivors.

We will try to get a sense of what makes Rimbaud’s poetry so influential, not only for Dylan, but for a whole host of modern artists.  Then we will study the intersection between Rimbaud’s work and Dylan’s.  Central to our concerns will be the role of the senses in poetic creation, as well as, of course, the relationship between lyric poetry and song.   Students will gain familiarity with the writing of a major modern poet and have the chance to work closely on issues of poetic language and versification.  Students will be expected to participate actively in the discussion and write two short papers.  The course will be in English.  No knowledge of French is required.Books on order:Rimbaud, Arthur.  Complete Works, Selected Letters, trans.

(1 unit Pass/No Pass)People today do not have enough poetry in their heads, and everyone should be able to recite one or two of their favorite poems. In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party some time, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.” In this seminar, we will read a number of classic poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types. Students will be encouraged to find other poems for the group to read. Participants will be required to memorize and recite 50-75 lines of their choice, and to prepare a short annotated anthology of their favorite poems.Steve Tollefson, a lecturer in the College Writing Programs, is the author of four books on writing and grammar as well as articles on a variety of subjects and several short stories.

Professor Judith ButlerThe seminar will consider how different versions of critique are developed within some major figures in Critical Theory. We will consider how Kant formulates the notion of critique in some of his essays and in sections of the Critique of Pure Reason, especially as it seeks to delimit the phenomenal world in which certain kinds of knowledge are restricted. We will then ask in what forms critique reemerges within Hegel’s writings, focusing on the opening chapters of The Phenomenology of Spirit and some of his early essays on sensuous understanding and property. The course will end with a consideration of the early Marx, focusing on his own critique of German Idealism, abstraction, and the importance of sensuous and embodied action and thought. One task of the course will be to understand the grounds and objects of critique in these thinkers, underscoring points of convergence and divergence.This course is instructor approval only.

Professor Michael LuceyIn this seminar we will be pursuing those aspects of meaning that occur not “in” texts but in between them – meaning that is to be found in the uses that  texts make of other texts, and that readers make of texts, in the histories that accumulate around texts and their different uses, in the histories also of their transmission and circulation.We could say that during the seminar we will investigate the ground between two assertions Bakhtin makes in “The Problem of Speech Genres.”  Early in that essay he comments: “the novel as a whole is an utterance just as rejoinders in everyday dialogue or private letter are.”  A bit later he observes: “Utterances are not indifferent to one another, and are not self-sufficient; they are aware of and mutually reflect one another . . . . Every utterance must be regarded primarily as a response to preceding utterances . . . . Each utterance refutes, affirms, supplements, and relies on the others, presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account.”  We will thus be interested in the particular kinds of “conversations” that link text-utterance to text-utterance, texts to users, texts to the uses that come to be made of them.  Reconstructing those conversations will involve us in careful thinking about different dynamic forms of contextualization, and about what is referred to as the indexical functioning of language: the way language produces meaning not simply semantically, but by drawing on other, prior uses of language.Specifically, we will think about how novels make use of other novels through a reading of a set of novels that could be said to be mutually involved in a number of different conversations: about novelistic form, about the ambitions novels might have to be instruments of knowledge, about the kinds of knowledge novels might want to be able to produce.  We’ll be particularly interested in sociological and aesthetic forms of knowledge and the relations novels produce between them.The novels we will look at are Scott’s Waverley, Balzac’s Les Chouans, Cooper’s The Pilot, Eliot’s Felix Holt, Proust’s A l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleur, and Woolf’s To the Lighthouse.  (You are welcome to read in translation.)  We’ll accompany our reading of the novels with readings of a wide range of theorists and critics including Bakhtin, Lukács, Benedict Anderson, Franco Moretti, Catherine Gallagher, Margaret Cohen and others.

Professor Harsha Ram The concept of world literature has existed in the West for approximately two centuries, although it owes its resurgence in popularity to the current post-Cold War era of globalization, as well as to a still ongoing restructuring of the field of Comparative Literature, after the “linguistic turn” in the humanities appeared exhausted. In place of the now traditional model of comparative literature as the rigorous study of predominantly Western national literatures in a given linguistic, historical, civilizational or theoretical frame, we have seen a rise of interest in non-Western literatures, accompanied by vigorous critiques of Eurocentrism, and a new openness to the properly global dimensions of literary production. Yet problems arise. Is world literature the sum of all literatures, or an expanded canon of their best and greatest? Is world literature a constitutable object or a set of questions and procedures? Should language training remain at the heart of comparative work? Is literature in translation the solution, or part of the problem? Assuming the existence of a potentially infinite global archive, must distant reading replace close reading, and quantitative analysis take the place of the aesthetic judgements that give rise to canon formation? Is world literature a system, or at least a series of circulatory networks, susceptible to theoretical modelling? Does the world literary system have a geography? Is it egalitarian or hierarchical? Is it a conglomerate of national literatures, or do other forces, such as the marketplace and transnational networks of circulation, have a role to play? How do we articulate the relationship between “major” and “minor” literatures, between “centres” and “peripheries”? What should we make of the diachronic dimension of world literature – above all the gap, found in many parts of the world, between classical or sacred languages and modern vernaculars – as well as the synchronic dimension – the existence of nations and world regions with distinct and often discontinuous experiences of the literary? To what extent are contemporary theories of world literature trapped by the historical limitations of modernity, and the generic limitations of the dominant modern genre: the novel? Would a literary system oriented towards other world regions, other historical periods or literary genres produce different models of world literature? Can older scholarly practices such as philology and poetics, which flourished independently and for centuries in many parts of the world, offer an alternative to current models of world literature? Critics we will be reading this semester include David Damrosch, Pascale Casanova, Franco Moretti, Emily Apter, J. G. Herder, Aleksandr Veselovsky, Aamir Mufti, Nirvana Tanoukhi, Vilashini Cooppan, Zhang Longxi, Sheldon Pollock, Michael Holquist, and Lawrence Venuti.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor S. VolppThe course aspires to provide an introduction to two fields of critical discourse that have developed rapidly in recent years, affect studies and “thing theory,” asking how it might be productive to consider these fields in tandem.  Why do things play such an important role in the discourse of sentiment?  We will focus in the first half of the course on eighteenth and nineteenth century Britain and China, and in the second half of the course on contemporary texts, but throughout we will consider how empire and the after-effects of empire create conditions in which sentimental objects are asked to perform certain types of cultural work.   Laurence Sterne’s A Sentimental Journey, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, Shen Fu’s Six Records of a Floating Life, and Cao Xueqin’s  Story of the Stone anchor the first half of the course; in the second half of the course we will consider  Wendy Law-yone’s The Coffin Tree, David Ondaatje’s Running in the Family, Michael Zadorian’s Second-hand, and Monique Truong’s The Book of Salt. Theorists and critics include Lauren Berlant, Bill Brown, Peter Brooks,  David Eng, Lynn Festa, Elaine Freedgood, Elizabeth Freeman, Heather Love, Melanie Klein, Douglas Mao, David Marshall, Eve Sedgwick, Susan Stewart, and  Annette WeinerWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Professor Niklaus LargierSo-called ‘mystical’ forms of thought and experience have played a major role in the history of modern philosophy and literature from Hegel to Georg Lukàcs, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, and Jacques Derrida, and from Novalis to Robert Musil, Paul Celan, Ingeborg Bachmann, Pierre Klossowski, and John Cage (to name just a few). In this seminar we will read and discuss key texts written by Eckhart of Hochheim (Meister Eckhart), Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Hadewijch of Antwerp, some of the most significant medieval figures in this tradition. During a second phase of the seminar we will turn our attention to baroque mysticism, especially Angelus Silesius and Jacob Böhme. Based on the class discussion and on individual student interests, we will then look into the ways how these texts have been read by 19th and 20th century authors and explore the impact they had on the formation of modern concepts of (and discussions about) subjectivity, affect, and agency.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

J. ButlerSeveral fundamental concepts for critical theory are introduced and provoked through Kafka’s writing: the problem of time and history, the human animal, objects and objectification, authority and law, language, theology and progress and their scattered remnants.  In this course, we will focus on the short fiction and parables of Kafka as well as the essays, fragments, and correspondence of critical theorists such as Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. We will also consider the more sporadic appearances of Kafka in the work of Hannah Arendt, Georg Lukács, Gershom Scholem, and Jacques Derrida as they each negotiate key questions of modernity, authority, and history.Kafka’s literary writings confounded historical and interpretive schemes of thinking and posed challenges for theoretical reflection on historical time, law, and writing itself. Kafka’s stories were often also letters, or diary entries, and similarly, some of Benjamin’s most important theoretical reflections on Kafka were articulated in correspondence with Adorno and Scholem. Adorno’s own writing registered the loss of historical continuity in new modes of philosophical writing. We will consider how such genres of writing cross-cut the relation between Kafka and his critical commentators, asking how this affects the relation between theoretical reflection and literary writing.Although this course will read Kafka mainly in relation to the correspondences and essays of Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno, and others working within the orbit of critical theory (including Derrida and Deleuze), it will also consider the genres of theory that emerge to fathom new constellations of history. For instance, how do the specific interpretive impasses enacted in Kafka’s work challenge theoretical writing to come to terms with the fragment and the ruin, and with the limits of progressive narration?  Along the way we will ask, did Kafka changed critical writing, of criticism more generally, and critical theory more specifically? If so, how do we now reflect upon genres of critical theory?The seminar will work with both the original German and English translations.Texts:Kafka, Parables and Paradoxes, Schocken Books, (ISBN 0805200126)Kafka, The Complete Stories, Schocken Books,  (ISBN 0-8052-1055-5)Kafka, Letters to Milena, Schocken Books, (ISBN 0-8052-0427-X) orLetters to Friends, Family, and Editors, Schocken Books, (ISBN 0714537012)The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin: 1910-1940, eds.

(This is a room-share with German 268.   Professor Teng notes that Students should be able to read German. However, the texts will be also available in English, so those students not as proficient in German may also take the course. French is not required, the French texts will be in translation.)In recent years, both literary studies and philosophy have taken great interest in tragedy, a literary genre usually considered the highest and – since German idealism – the most philosophical in the generic hierarchy. Against the background of recent literary scholarship and critical theory, this seminar examines the development of tragedy from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. Concerned with the irresolvable conflicts in ethical life, tragedy in this period registers the vicissitudes of European modernity by means of ever evolving poetic and aesthetic programs. The seminar will try to map three interrelated domains: Poetics of tragedy from Aristotle through French classicism and German classicism to formal innovations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; philosophy of the tragic from German idealism (Hoelderlin, Hegel) through cultural theories around 1900 (Nietzsche, Simmel, Benjamin) to contemporary critical theory (Adorno, Menke, Cavell); main issues of the modern age as reflected in the key works of the tragic genre such as sovereignty (French classicism and the baroque Trauerspiel), moral and legal order (Diderot, Lessing, Goethe, Ibsen), exigency of history (from Schiller to Heiner Mueller), and crisis of selfhood (expressionism). Conducted in English.

Professor Robert AlterThe course will be run as an advanced workshop in literary translation.   Each student will have a translation project that he or she will work on throughout the semester.  There are no restrictions as to language, literary genre, or historical period.  Each week, two students will circulate specimens of their translations via email, and the class will then be devoted to detailed discussion of their work.   Though in the past some participants have aspired to be translators (and three published volumes of translation have so far issued from these seminars), the basic premise of the course is that translation is a deeply instructive process about the workings of any literary text and that all students of literature can benefit from applying themselves for a time to translation.W 3-6:00

Professor Anne-Lise Francois A comparative course exploring the intersections of literature, psychoanalysis, queer studies, and environmental studies.Popular environmentalist discourse is often portrayed as the province of misanthropes, lonely-hearts and “kill-joys,” whose “downer” ethics can only be articulated in the negative—as the demand to curb and curtail hedonistic consumption.   This course asks about the odd place of pleasure and desire in environmental literature broadly defined. What kinds of “romances” can be sustained with something called “nature” or with particular places or nonhuman others?  We will give special attention to stories that deviate from the dominant myth of an original fall from paradise and lost plenitude, and that re-imagine ideas of normalcy, home, and community.  Drawing on the multiple senses of “queer,” from its contemporary usage as a term for same-sex sexual orientation to its older meanings (“odd,” “deviant,” “of questionable character,” “oblique”), we will look at texts that break the normative yoking of sexuality to reproduction and offer alternatives lines of transmission and inheritance. We will compare different ways of thinking the relation between “madness” and “civilization” and of imagining community between humans and with other living beings.  We will also examine the surprising convergence of figures of secrecy, shame and lack—from “the gay closet” to the idea of nature as an “open secret”—in queer, gender and environmental studies.Readings by Bersani, Butler, Carson, Coleridge, Darwin, Deleuze, Edelman, Erikson, Foucault, Freud, Hadot, Haraway, Jewett, Kropotkin, Morton, Malthus, Ovid, Rousseau, Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, Silverman, Thoreau, Winnicott, William Wordsworth.Films by Hitchcock, Ang Lee, Herzog, Varda.This course has been canceled.

Professor Harsha RamThe role of national literatures in consolidating the cultural heritage of modern nations is indisputable. National literary histories organize and collate a remote, often premodern past, even as they consolidate linguistic standards and canonize new generic forms: in this sense they are essential for articulating the linguistic and aesthetic dimensions of the relationship between “tradition” and “modernity.” In much of the world, however, while tradition could be perceived as indigenous, modernity was necessarily an imported construct, violently imposed by colonial rule, but also creatively and critically adapted by literate élites. Modernity, like nationalism, was generally a modular or mobile framework whose specific content would be provided by the interaction between a given literary archive and an ascendant national narrative. National narratives, modernizing and anti-colonial in aspiration, nonetheless had to confront numerous historical, cultural and epistemic challenges. How is one to constitute an independent cultural field when the very terms of discussion are themselves the product of western scholarship? How to distinguish and delimit the nation territorially and linguistically in the face of regional diversity, civilizational currents, migrations and cosmopolitan cultural flows that clearly exceed a putative national tradition? Readings will be primarily from literary theory, antrhopology and historiography; authors to be studied include Benedict Anderson, Eric Hobsbawm, Sheldon Pollock, Fredric Jameson, Frtanco Moretti, Pascal Casanova, Edward Said, Johannes Fabien, Partha Chatterjee, Roberto Schwarz, James Clifford, and Kumkum Sangari.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

F. Masiello Also listed as Spanish 280:3 This seminar is devoted to an investigation of the concept of Global South in the imagination of colonizers, explorers, and creative writers beginning in the 19th century  and reaching today’s novelists, poets, filmmakers, and social critics.  To approach the idea of “South,” we’ll focus in particular on the representation of that southernmost frontier of the Americas known as the Patagonia and then consider, within the heart of Europe, the shaping of the Italian South known as the mezzogiorno. Not simply a study of colonial impulses, the course will also be a study of the babelic language crossings that take place on real and imagined borderlands, and the possibilities of resistance that the South offers political subjects.Starting with Darwin’s observations about Patagonia and Mme. De Stael’s assessments of Italy, we will read about the ways in which the South enters the cultural imagination of those who see in the remote geographic outpost the possibility of challenging cosmopolitan sensibilities and expanding the role of the state. We will take this through the tropes of “barbarism” that are carried in descriptions of the south, along with the potential for resistance that Southern lands encourage (especially the outlaw and the brigand). In the second half of the course, we will address the shifting geographic and political boundaries that allow for discursive claims for secession (vis a vis the Italian North set against the South, and the demands of the “King of Patagonia”) and will conclude with two discussions anchored through a literary lens: on the one hand, the presence of African immigrants in the Italian South who reshape geographical and cultural landscapes; on the other, the emergence of Mapuche indigenous voices in southern Chile and Argentina whose demands for rectifications of land rights and social recognition have become a thorn in the hide of the state. Our work will require a study of the operations of travel discourse, the estheticization of nature, the building of cultural difference (based on race, language, and nation), and the literary and cultural representations of utopias and social justice. Based on the theoretical materials supplied in the first part of the course, students will be invited to report on their own locations of “South” and to lead us in discussion of the cultural and literary dynamics that their research on “South” engenders.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

F. MasielloIn this course, we will address the ways in which 19th century writers of the Americas engaged in discussion of liberal democracy by evoking the world of the senses. The underlying paradigm here is the “civilization versus barbarism” antinomy in which civilization is equated with the realm of reason and barbarism with the realm of the senses. But in the novels, essays, and poetry of the mid-19th, these categories are often confused, and with it, the ways of imagining a pluralistic social space in which bodies come in contact with each other. If, then, the awakening of feeling through sensation triggers a speculation about the future of the nation, it also stirs contradiction about the limits of writerly desire such that the discourses on race, class, gender and eros are far from resolved. Here, the major texts for study are Melville’s Moby Dick and Sarmiento’s Facundo, but the representation of the sensorium will also be traced through essay, melodramatic mode, essay, and poetry. The corpus will be defined by a selection of writers from the American Renaissance (in the USA) and Latin American romantics.Hudson, Wm. H. Idle Days in Patagonia.Gómez de Avellaneda, Gertrudis.

With both creative and scholarly interest in puppetry, Taylor has written plays for Handspring Puppet Company, such as Ubu and the Truth Commission, and has edited a critical study of the performance troupe. Taylor is currently working on a large-scale study of the performance of sincerity, examining the impact of the Reformation on modes of self-presentation.The seminar will begin with a consideration of the anti-theatrical prejudice and the impact of the Reformation and the Counter Reformation on the performance of sincerity. Discussions will be organized around a series of distinct sites, aesthetic, juridical and medical, through which questions of the sincere and the authentic were tested in the early modern era. Questions of theology will be considered, particularly with reference to the substance of conversion, and the seminar will investigate the emergence of Acting Theory; the birth of the novel; traditions of painting; the anatomy lesson; and discourses on evidence and proof as legal categories.The last two meetings will consider the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in an exploration of how we might have arrived where we are, especially with regard to questions of sincerity and martyrdom, terror, and truth.Click here for more information about the course and the Townsend Center. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Restrictions: graduate students onlyVictor Hugo remarked that “a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real.” Hugo’s words not only fundamentally question what might be called the realist project but also contain a rudimentary yet thought-provoking theory about how sublime historical events come about.Hugo’s remark leads to four suppositions that are each well worth examining: that the here-and-now may be less “real” than we like to think; that, conversely, the past may not be solely something of the past; that creating something as radically new as a revolution is an instance of moving forward by moving backward; and, finally, that the desire to reestablish contact with, or immersion in, “reality” (whatever that may be) is an important mainspring for groundbreaking human action. Exploring Hugo’s words is, in fact, a very timely exercise: it may – when the 19th century word “fictitious” is substituted by its 21st century equivalent “virtual” – shed light on how present-day homo Google relates to “the real.”Session I

PLEASE NOTE: This course may be taken as a one-unit course (CC 17392), meeting in four consecutive sessions with Beatriz Sarlo on Nov. 9, 16, 23, 30, or as a two-unit course (CC 17395) meeting a total of eight sessions, 4 with Francine Masiello and 4 with Beatriz Sarlo.The course will examine the discourse on travel as a way to account for different symbolic, political, social, and ethnic experiences. We will begin with the assertion of travel literature as an “objective” form of autobiographical and of scientific research, and then break down the model. Readings will integrate theoretical accounts of travel from major Latin American authors, among them the 19th century Sarmiento and the 20th century Victoria Ocampo. These examples will help develop an inquiry about tourism especially in its comparative manifestations–as entertainment and distraction for a mass public or as an inquiry for a lettered elite who prevailed upon travel accounts to advance a national project at home. Texts will include professionally written narratives as well as postcards, letters, and visual records from the 19th through 21st centuries.
Readings selected for each meeting include classical travel studies and contemporary reflections. The material should work as an introduction to travel writing and may suggest further ways of considering it in terms of place, time, and mobility. Discussion topics will cover a wide range and will include: Writing and painting spaces; The politician as exile and the idéologue as traveler; When music travels, jazz in Buenos Aires and tango on Broadway.Beatriz Sarlo is a scholar of Latin American literature and culture and one of the most important Argentine literary and cultural critics of the last 40 years. She has been a Professor at the University of Buenos Aires and has held Visiting Professorships throughout Europe and the U.S. A public intellectual, Sarlo is the author of more than two dozen books on literary criticism, cultural history, visual culture, and politics.Francine Masiello is Sidney and Margaret Ancker Distinguished Professor in the Humanities in the Departments of Spanish and Portuguese & Comparative Literature.For more information or a complete syllabus, contact Teresa Stojkov, Associate Director, Townsend Center: tstojkov@berkeley.edu or visit townsendcenter.berkeley.edu.

His seminar will explore the ways in which race has served as the ordinary radioactive core of American history, continually warping the potential for ordinary class-based politics and accounting for all manner of perverse American exceptionalism.The first session of the course will focus on the work of installation and assemblage artist Edward Kienholz and his viscerally charged 1968-1970 response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the lynchings that preceded it. The next three sessions will follow Kienholz’s work successively through American history to consider a series of key moments, spanning from Bacon’s Rebellion and the Revolutionary War, through the end of Reconstruction, to the Civil Rights movement and the subsequent rise and dominance of a white racist party.

1 unitProfessor Catherine Malabou will be in residence at the Townsend Center for the Humanities from April 2nd-23rd to offer a 1-unit, 4-week graduate seminar.The leading question of this seminar will be: if we were to start our life anew, would we choose to live the same as the one we already lived, or would we opt for a totally new one? This question, inscribed at the heart of both Platonic and Nietzschean philosophies, opens to that of memory, repetition, erasure and change. It also addresses the ethical problem of self-improvement (would we like to be better?), as well as that of the absence of any possible transformation of the past (as in Orphic myths, Greek tragedies, and traumatic situations). This seminar will provide a philosophical approach to these issues, but will also invite different colleagues from other disciplines to contribute to the debate using literature, anthropology, film, etc. as archival supports to elaborate on the central questions.French Philosopher Catherine Malabou teaches at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University in London. She is the author of The Future of Hegel (2005), What Should We Do with Our Brain? (2008), Plasticity at the Eve of Writing (2009) and Self and Emotional Life: Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, and Neuroscience (2013). Her work has created the foundation for a wide range of current research focusing on the intersections between neuro and biological science and the humanities.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

What can twenty-first century readers get out of reading works that were written in Greek and Latin thousands of years ago?  Is the primary goal historical understanding? the pleasure of an engaging story? a meditation on human emotions that transcend vast shifts in culture and time? In this class we will read some central texts from Greco-Roman antiquity, with the goal of exploring different notions of why this practice makes sense and what we can do with it.  Rather than start from the assumption that reading ancient texts is worth doing, this class will ask students to think critically about why and how such reading might matter or not matter. In fact, the questions we will ask are relevant for reading in general – what do we get out of texts that intersect with our own experience and what do we get from those very foreign to our own experience?

One of the enduring appeals of novels is their ability to offer us access to other mind. Thus fictional characters can feel like close friends, and reading books can often be a practice in empathetic imagination, giving us the chance (at least for a few hundred pages) to walk in another’s shoes. But how do literary texts create the fiction of being inside someone’s consciousness? In this course we will investigate this problem by paying attention to novelistic techniques and literary history, while also examining how the mind has been imagined and understood by writers, philosophers, psychologists, and scientists.Our focus will be on works of modernism (spanning the later nineteenth to the mid twentieth century), a literary movement characterized by an intense interest in the workings of consciousness. What is the role of memory, attention, and habit in creating a sense of self? What can we know about other people’s minds, and how do we know our own? How have the categories of “normal” and “abnormal” minds been constructed and defined, and how have they been applied to specific groups of people?List of books:Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary, translator Lydia Davis, (Penguin, 2011)

While we may consider different definitions and origin stories of the lyric genre–as muted song, verbal picture, overheard speech, or emotive expression–our main focus will be on learning how to read and write about poetry in its shorter forms. You will be encouraged to read in the original when possible, but all readings will be provided in English.Poetry by Sappho, Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Bashō, Shiki, Keats, Baudelaire, Dickinson, Rilke, Lorca, Bishop, and Niedecker, among others.

Professor Michelle KoernerIn this course we will explore the diversity of selected works of American literature, film, and music produced during the “long sixties” (1955-1975). Placing considerable emphasis on the relationship between artistic experimentation and the emancipatory social movements of the period, we will ask how innovative practices of language, image, and sound related to the more directly political actions associated with the Civil Rights Movement, the Student Movement, the Black and Red Power Movements, and the Women’s and Gay Liberation Movements.  How did writers, filmmakers, visual artists, and musicians used their work to question the dominant ideology of the post-war period and to challenge war, racism, social and economic inequality, sexual violence and gendered discrimination? What role did poetry, music, and visual art play in creating new collectivities and new potentials for social transformation? What new concepts, practices, and styles emerged from the encounters between artistic and social movements?Given the persistence of the “sixties” in the U.S. cultural imaginary we will also seek to critically engage contemporary adaptations and representations of past works, events, and figures associated with the period. How and for what purposes does the present “revision” the past? What claims does that past still make on our own present?Course materials include texts (poetry, fiction, journalism, manifestos), images (photographs, independent films, television clips, visual art), and sounds (music, recorded voice performances and political speeches) produced between 1955-1975 as well as more recent documentaries and critical essays addressing the period. Primary readings will likely include James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time (1963), Thomas Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Valerie Solanas’s SCUM Manifesto (1967), Tom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968) and N. Scott Momaday’s House Made of Dawn (1969) as well as selections from Ann Charter’s The Sixties Reader and Donald Allen’s The New American Poetry. Over the course of the semester we will also view several independent/experimental films including: The Cry of Jazz (1959), Dog Star Man IV (1964), Finally Got the News (1970), Letter to Jane (1972) and Nous Parlons, Vous Ecoutez (1975)Written assignments include two short response essays, a formal analysis, and a final research paper. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

M. KoernerIn this course we will explore the diversity of selected works of American literature, film, and music produced during the “long sixties” (1955-1975). Placing considerable emphasis on the relationship between artistic experimentation and emancipatory social movements, we will consider how innovative practices of language, image, and sound were mobilized alongside the more directly political actions associated with the Civil Rights Movement, the Student Movement, the Black and Red Power Movements, and the Women’s and Gay Liberation Movements. How have writers, filmmakers, visual artists, and musicians used their work to challenge war, racism, social and economic inequality, sexual violence and gendered discrimination? What critical and conceptual tools emerged in the encounters between artistic and social movements? What critical practices and theoretical orientations might enable us to better understand the points of connection between aesthetic and social revolutions? What, for instance, is at stake in the notion of a counter-culture or a cultural revolution? What criteria do we use to define “political art”?Given the persistence of the “sixties” in the U.S. cultural imaginary – mostly recently evidence by a range of new films, documentaries, and television series focused on this transitional period in U.S. history – a significant portion of this course will also be devoted to critically engaging contemporary adaptations and representations of past works, events, and figures associated with the “sixties.” How and for what purposes does the present “revision” the past? What claims does that past still make on our own present?Course materials include texts (poetry, fiction, journalism, manifestos), images (photographs, independent films, television clips, visual art), and sounds (music, recorded voice performances and political speeches) produced between 1955-1975, as well as selected contemporary films, documentaries, and critical essays.

Professor Enrique LimaIn this course we will examine the development of “the West” as a historical and literary concept. We will investigate its role in the creation of American identities and as a space in which those identities may be contested and refigured. We will begin with Frederick Jackson Turner’s famous “frontier thesis.” The emptiness of the western frontier, argued Turner, was responsible for fostering the sense of individual responsibility that is at the core of American democracy. We will read Willa Cather’s Death Comes for the Archbishop as a complicated rewriting of the West as the territory of self and national formation. Death Comes illustrates the ways in which the West has been configured as the productive place in which people of European descent become Americans. Unlike Turner, Cather does not empty the West of non-White peoples. She does, however, minimize the conflict that underwrote Western expansion. The effects of that historical process are at the heart of D’Arcy McNickle’s Wind from an Enemy Sky. McNickle’s novel is keenly interested in the effects of colonial subjugation on surviving native communities. The legacies of historical violence, McNickle suggests, continue to shape the lives of Native Americans. Just as conquest created Native America as we know it so too did it create the analogous place of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans as subjects that have been incorporated as external to the nation-state that is their home. Ramón Saldívar’s The Borderlands of Culture, Américo Paredes’ George Washington Gómez, and Helena Viramontes’ Under the Feet of Jesus, one a critical/theoretical work, the other two novels, explore the meaning of the border on people of Mexican descent and on the very fabric of American culture. In the last section of the course we will turn to the history and aesthetics of violence as it relates to the West. Violence, Richard Slotkin argues in Regeneration Through Violence, is not just an Indian or a Mexican problem. Rather, he maintains, violence is one of the spiritual sources of American national identity broadly conceived. The western frontier has been conquered through violence and that violence, at once disavowed and sublimated, remains a determining feature of Americans’ vision of themselves. Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian is a profound and aesthetically dense meditation on the role of frontier violence on American culture. Leslie Marmon Silko’s Almanac of the Dead is another. Almanac refuses to recognize any of the national borders that cut through the West as violent colonial inventions. The West, this course maintains, has a privileged position in the imaginary geography of U.S. nationalism. It has often been configured as the open space of possibility, the place where pure individualism has had the space to explore its limits. But this imaginary geography as the course’s readings will show has just as often come in conflict with the historical West as a colonized territory that continues to be contested by Native Americans, Mexicans, Latinos, and Anglos.

Professor Robert KaufmanThis seminar (which is cross-listed as Rhetoric 221 and Critical Theory 205) is not an introduction to Theodor W. Adorno’s work; rather, it will involve sustained reading and discussion of Adorno’s last major text, which he was still finishing at the time of his 1969 death: Aesthetic Theory (1970). We will be reading Robert Hullot-Kentor’s English translation of Ästhetische Theorie; though we will sometimes briefly consider the original German text, knowledge of German is not required (though it would of course prove very helpful).What makes possible such sustained reading of a dense, famously difficult work, is at least some familiarity with figures, texts, and artistic, aesthetic, and political movements that Aestheic Theory  assumes its readers to have had some acquaintance with, including –among many others–Kant, Hegel, Marx and Engels, Lukács, the French Revolutions of 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871, Lenin, the Bolshevik Revolution, Marxism-Leninism, Romanticism,  Realism, Symbolism,  Naturalism, Modernism, Dada, Surrealism, Avant-Gardism,  Social and Socialist Realism,  Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Postmoderrnism!!!It’s worth knowing that Adorno’s final text is written with the expectation–though it won’t be our expectiation or prerequisite–that its readers will have previously encountered, for example:  Kant’s Critique of Judgment; Hegel’s Lectures on the Fine Arts and Phenomenology of Spirit; Marx’s Theses on Feuerbach, Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, and Das Kapital (esp. the chapter-section “The Secret of Commodity Fetishism”); Marx and Engels’ The German Ideology and The Communist Manifesto; Walter Benjamin’s “One-Way Street,” “The Storyteller,” “Surrealism,” “The Author as Producer,” “Conversations with Brecht,” “The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility [Mechanical Reproduction],” “The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire,” “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire,” “On the Concept of History [Theses on the Philosophy of History],”  The Origins of the German Play of Mourning, and The Arcades Project; as well as Adorno and/or Adorno and Horkheimer’s Dialectic of Enlightenment, “On Lyric Poetry and Society,” “Cultural Criticism and Society,” “Commitment [Engagement],” “The Essay as Form,” “Parataxis”,  Minima Moralia, and Negative Dialectics. (Take a deep breath–and then realize that, depending on how you feel at any given moment, it gets better–or worse: that is, what you’ve just read has been, incredibly enough, a very minimal listing!)Meanwhile, Aesthetic Theory offers sustained and repeated yet often extraordinarily compressed responses to some celebrated political and aesthetic/critical-theory debates, and does so on yet another assumption: that Aesthetic Theory’s readers are aware not only of these debates, but of the histories of  key concepts and phenomena at issue within them, such as: the status of objectivist conceptuality vs. aesthetic quasi- or extra-conceptuality; the notions, in art and critical theory, of the constellation and force-field; the concepts of use-value, exchange value, and reflective-judgment value; mechanical/technical/technological reproduction’s value, over/against aesthetic value; art’s political commitment (or engagement) vs. its aesthetic/artistic autonomy;  mass, popular, and conceptually undetermined culture; relations among subjectivity, critical agency, and class consciousness.And finally, Aesthetic Theory presumes that among the artists we as readers will know include Cervantes, Shakespeare,Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Hölderlin, Shelley, Byron, Dickens, Robert Browning, Swinburne, Mörike, Rilke, Stefan George, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Zola, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Ibsen, Strindberg, Eliot, Pound, William Carlos Williams, the Surrealists,Brecht, Lorca, Sartre, Joyce, Beckett, Celan, Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wagner, Berg, Webern, Schönberg, Weill, Eisler, Boulez, Cage, Stockhausen, Goya, David, Ingres, Delacroix, Gericault, Courbet, Manet, Cezanne, Monet, Picasso, Braque, Grosz, Gris, Léger, Pollock, Kline, Rothko, Guston….Our first one or two class sessions will be devoted to an extremely brisk sketching of the earlier texts, figures, political/artistic/critical movements, and concepts mentioned above (starting with the Kant and continuing through writings by Adorno and his Frankfurt School colleagues). The major part of the semester’s undertakings–-our close, careful reading of Aesthetic Theory–-will then seek, starting in the second  or third session, to understand, interpret, and respond to the text’s treatments of modern art’s development on its own terms, and in relation to mostly Kantian, Hegelian, Marxian,and earlier Frankfurt Critical-Theory traditions of aesthetics and critique. We’ll pay ongoing attention to how and why the imaginative, potentially intersubjective activity traditionally understood to be at the heart of aesthetic experience turns out, with various twists, to be crucial too to Adorno’s overall analyses of modernity, mechanical/technical/technological reproduction and reproducibility (in both the economic and artistic-aesthetic spheres), and critical agency. We’ll also consider how Aesthetic Theory’s concerns and legacies might engage the changed sociopolitical circumstances–-and the changed artistic-aesthetic, critical-theoretical tendencies­—-of the last four decades.  Among the seminar’s emphases will be an ongoing inquiry into how attention to artworks’ formal, stylistic, and philosophical-theoretical dynamics (the relation of artistic technique to aesthetic form and aesthetic experience) may offer stimulus toward, and insight into, historical, sociopolitical, and ethical understanding and engagement.TEXTS:Required:–Theodor W.

Laura WagnerFiction is full of characters who exert a pull on their readers: those in whom we see versions of ourselves, those we hate to love or love to hate, and those who remain forever inscrutable no matter how hard we try to get inside their thoughts and feelings.  While one of our first instincts as readers may be to respond to such characters in terms of attraction and aversion, as friend or as foe, we’re also told repeatedly that one of the cardinal sins of serious literary engagement is to “identify” with the figures who populate the worlds we read about, who are, after all, mere words on the page.This course proposes to take seriously our reactions to literary characters: rather than simply dismiss our impulse to respond to these fictional figures as real people, we’ll interrogate exactly how and why fictional texts make us respond as we do to the people who populate their pages. More specifically, we’ll focus our attention on characters in works of twentieth century American fiction to ask what strategies these texts use to represent the particularities of individual experience and how our access to these characters might also provide a portrait of the broader historical and cultural scope of the America in which he or she lives. We’ll consider how first person, stream of consciousness narration might offer us a useful vantage point from which to trace the rise of American slavery in A Mercy and the decline of Southern society in The Sound and the Fury. We’ll ask how questions of voice not only structure the development of the female protagonists in Zora Neale Hurston and Jamaica Kincaid’s novels, but also how these texts position voice in relation to larger questions of African-American identity and American feminism. We’ll travel to two different New Jerseys, to the world of the Italian-American mafia in The Sopranos and the Dominican immigrant community in The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, encountering charismatic characters whose surface charm and winning manner draw us into their often horrifying worlds and others who are worthier of our sympathy but have to work much harder to earn it. Throughout the course, we’ll also ask what makes these characters distinctly American and how they help to welcome us into, and perhaps implicate us in, distinct portraits of America at various moments in its history.Requirements for this course include careful reading/viewing of assigned course texts, active class participation, an in-class presentation, an analytical paper, and a creative project in which students produce and analyze their own fictional American character.Course texts:

Jessica CreweEven as we prepare to mark the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War (on May 9th, 2015), secessionist movements — from Texas’s ongoing struggles to regain its status as a separate nation to the anti-corporate Second Vermont Republic independence effort — are still going strong.While it seems unlikely that the United States will actually lose any of its fifty members in the near future, communities within the larger United States maintain a notable tradition of rejecting claims of American sovereignty and striking out to establish their own independent or semi-independent collectives.Departing from narratives of cultural assimilation common to visions of the American melting pot, this course will focus instead on the historical and popular legacies of separatist movements in the United States. We will ask: how do the manifestos of idealist and revolutionary groups, including the 19th-century free-loving Fourierists, the lesbian separatists of the 1970s, or Oakland’s own Black Panthers, reveal contemporary debates about what it means (or should mean) to be an American resident and citizen? How have federal and state authorities engaged historically with separatist communities and with sovereign indigenous nations within the geographical borders of the United States? What have been the long-term and inter-generational effects of the state-sponsored separation of minority communities such as the Japanese-Americans interned during World War II? And how do these legacies of both voluntary and involuntary cultural separation continue to influence current American politics and popular culture? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments. Week One: Southern Secession Continues (In Fiction, At Least)

Simona SchneiderThis class proposes to look at journeys of self-discovery that are also a discovery of diversity in the  American racial and cultural makeup as depicted in films and poems predominantly from the 1970s. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to end racial discrimination that prevented African Americans from voting, an important structural change, however attitudes surrounding the implementation of these rights continue to pose problems today. In lieu of focusing on threats from abroad, a new generation of filmmakers and poets created works that both documented the contemporary racial landscape and exposed ossified race, gender and class stratification. Rather than tracing linear trajectories along these well-trodden lines, these journeys emphasize wandering through episodic logics like that of Homer’s Odyssey and allow for a proliferation of encounters. We will discuss how road, space and time travel films reveal mythologies and realities associated with an idea of Americanness and talk about the conditions and challenges that accompany the desire for a homecoming. These encounters often begin with stereotypes and venture far afield into unknown territories, both geographical and psychological, even interplanetary. We will seek to understand postmodern forms and what the awareness of genre and metanarratives can contribute to an understanding of race and performativity of race. We will focus our attention on affect theory and how guilt, shame and contempt constitute an individual embodiment of large-scale socio-political and economic structural norms and priorities.The course satisfies the American Cultures requirement.Required Films:American Graffiti dir.

From Virgil’s epic of state-building to Petrarch’s coronation as poet laureate of Italy in the fourteenth century or Langston Hughes’ poem “Let America Be America Again,” writers have always reflected upon, critiqued, and embodied national identities in poetry. Think of how much the Aeneid exemplifies Rome and her history, or Walt Whitman’s exuberant “Leaves of Grass” defines the expansive American landscape and spirit. In this course, we will explore how (North) Americans – natives, settlers, slaves, and immigrants – have crafted American identities in poetry and imagined America as land, birthright, culture, and nation.By the seventeenth century when the first European settlers came to America, Europe had an infrastructure for the production and circulation of poetry. Court and patronage culture provided financing and context, publishers produced texts swiftly with the printing press, and reading communities of scholars, churchmen, aristocrats, and merchants were well established. This would not be true of America for many years – centuries even – and this course will begin by exploring the sorts of unconventional – and often oral – verse that was produced in America in the colonial and Revolutionary period. We will approach these forms and their authors by way of the spaces that produced them: the church, the field, the schoolroom, the prison, the house, the battlefield. Thinking in terms of space rather than genre or poetic form will allow us to integrate and compare different populations of Americans in a way that bisects racial, economic, and gendered groups; the ethnic groups upon which we will focus – Native Americans, European settlers, and African-Americans – can also be thought of in terms of cross-racial and trans-historical groupings – prisoners, students, workers, worshippers.Thus, the first half of this course construes American “poetry” broadly, as oral and written texts with lyric qualities – rhyme, meter, song. By the nineteenth century, however, poets began to emerge. The second half of the course, covering the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, addresses two figures and one movement that defined American poetry: Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and the Harlem Renaissance (with a particular focus on Gwendolyn Bennett, Langston Hughes, and Claude McKay). These poets developed singularly American voices by thematizing American spaces – the open land, the city, the garret. Finally, the course will draw to a close by studying the Bay Area’s rich poetic history: San Francisco poetry, the California small press movement, and the great poets currently teaching at Berkeley. Thinking about local poetry will further deepen students’ appreciation for the bonds between local spaces and identities, and poetry. We explore the spaces of the bookstore (City Lights), the press-room, and the library (the Bancroft).The course does not presume to provide a complete survey of American poetry. Instead, students will gain expertise in three different areas. First, the mechanics of literary form and how to read and analyze both metrical and free verse. Secondly, knowledge of several crucial figures, poetic forms, and poetic movements: for example, Anne Bradstreet, the spiritual, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, the blues, the Harlem Renaissance, California poetry. Finally, students will explore in depth the relationship between poetry and nation, and how poetic texts have produced a wide range of American identities. Through these diverse moments, and with the help of critical texts and supplementary sources in prose, images, and music – journals, captivity narratives, sermons, songs, paintings, newspaper articles – we will interrogate the ways poets have cobbled together an American identity from disparate sources and in wildly varied voices.

Ramsey McGlazer“Who will write the history of tears?” – Roland BarthesMelodramas traffic in heightened emotions, stylized gestures, schmaltzy scores, and undeveloped characters.  They center on broken hearts and broken homes, and they tell stories punctuated by contrived meetings, missed encounters, sudden reversals of fortune, and sentimental scenes of revelation, recognition, reunion, rescue, and irretrievable loss.  Once dismissively labeled “women’s weepies,” melodramas have been seen more recently to represent “the dominant mode of classic Hollywood cinema.”  Often disparaged as politically out of touch and aesthetically over the top, melodramatic modes have also been called the only “realisms” capable of rendering contexts of radical inequality, and filmmakers continue to draw on melodramatic conventions in their explorations of race, gender, sexuality, and power.What accounts for the enduring appeal of US melodrama today? Why would directors across the globe have recourse to conventions devised and perfected by an outmoded Hollywood system?  And why do film critics and historians still insist on the relevance of this system’s products, with some going so far as to suggest that melodrama crucially informs our understanding and even our experience of ongoing social conflicts?  What alternative frames remain available, and what challenges await filmmakers who try to break with melodrama’s generic codes?This summer, we’ll work to answer these and related questions while we also undertake to write the history of tears—or rather, to write several such histories.  For as we find that there is more than one history of tears, we will have to add to Barthes’s famous question another of our own: whose tears? Pursuing answers to this last question will mean paying particular attention to melodramatic stagings of racialization, migration, and class aspiration as well as gender. Although our focus will be on classic, US- made tear-jerkers, we’ll also track the movement of melodramatic conventions from Hollywood to the postwar European art film and beyond, to the new queer cinema in the US and recent films from other continents, which will prompt us to ask what, if anything, is specifically “American” about the melodramatic tradition we’ll consider.We’ll study films by some of the following directors:  Almodóvar, Araki, Borden, Dash, Daniels, Gerima, Haynes, Hitchcock, Llosa, Mankiewicz, Martel, Nava, Reygadas, Rivera, Sirk, Vidor, and Washington. We’ll also read literary and critical works by Berlant, Bersani and Dutoit, Brooks, Cavell, Doane, Miller, Povinelli, Sapphire, Sexton, Stockton, Thoreau, Wilderson, and Williams, among others. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Katie KadueFrom cowboys to captains of industry, from old-money gentlemen to new-world adventurers, from uniformed soldiers to mold-breaking mavericks, Americans have long looked up to masculine heroes. Meanwhile, those who fail to conform to conventional standards of masculinity – effete intellectuals and stay-at-home dads, cuckolded husbands and 40-year-old virgins – earn society’s mockery and scorn. In this course, we’ll ask how assumptions about masculinity (and femininity) inform representations of men in texts, films, songs, and images, and what contradictions complicate them. We’ll also consider the roles that race, class, religion, sexuality, and nationality play in these representations and our reactions to them.Our texts may include Thoreau’s Walden, Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, James’ The American, Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, Chandler’s The Big Sleep, and Walker’s Meridian. We’ll also look at films like The Philadelphia Story, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Top Gun, Do the Right Thing, The Big Lebowski, and Grizzly Man. And we’ll consider selected episodes of Mad Men, The Wire, and Breaking Bad; the U.S. Senate hearings on the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy; critical works by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, Lee Edelman, and Camille Paglia; and lyrics by Bob Dylan, Lil Wayne, and Kanye West, among others.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Kathryn CrimAmerica has a special romance with what’s underground: from the Gold Rush to the oil fields to fracking, we’ve long imagined a secret store of wealth and resources beneath the soil, even as we also fear enough won’t ever be found there. In California especially, a legacy of worrying and warring over the groundwater stretches from the “water wars” of the early 20th century to our most recent ballot Proposition 1, which sought to manage the care and movement of water to various parts of the state.There is, of course, another American underground: the sites and networks of cultural innovation, political radicalism, and social protest. In the 19th century, ex-slaves escaped the southern United States along an Underground Railroad of sympathetic abolitionists. In the 20th century various groups continued to borrow on this figurative notion of being “underground”: the dissident Weather Underground, an avant-garde movement of “underground film,” even Lou Reed and John Cale’s Velvet Underground; feminist, queer, and socialist activists have often gathered “underground.” And sometimes underground is nothing more than an idea of retreat, refuge, or the grave.This summer we’ll go on a tour of subcultures and subterranean byways, asking after the relationship between what’s literally stored or moving beneath the earth and what is figured as “underground” thought, action, music, or art. Is there an intimate connection between what’s taboo (or even criminal) and new forms of cultural production? From the dark streets of Los Angeles, to the oil fields of New Mexico, along the snaking subway, and into the basement, we’ll draw on a diverse collection of texts—films, poetry, music, fictional and nonfictional narrative, protest literature, and critical essays. We’ll be particularly attune to how and why the “underground” seems like such an important metaphor for acts of resistance and experimental forms of representation. And we’ll ask what happens when what lies beneath emerges suddenly (sometimes in a gush or a flood) on the surface.Films and Photography and Music:Roman Polanski, Chinatown

Marianne KaletzkyIf Los Angeles, at the center of the culture industry, is charged with representing America to the world, it is also obsessed with representing itself. According to its own mythology, there is no better place than L.A. to realize the quintessentially American dream of leaving the past behind and making one’s own destiny. And if L.A. considers itself the ideal setting for American self-fashioning, it also bills itself as the product of such a process: a city of big dreams and endless possibilities, built against the blank canvas of the desert.Yet this utopian portrayal of Los Angeles obscures its long history as a site of imperial conquest, racial oppression, class struggle, and environmental devastation. This course aims not only to elucidate the various myths associated with the city—from the Hollywood dream of the postwar period to the contemporary celebration of L.A. as global city of the future—but also to allow a more critical understanding of these myths by asking how they intersect with racial and ethnic categories. To whose experiences does each myth give preference? By whom is it created, and for whom? Whose experiences does it exclude?Most of our conversations will be devoted to specific neighborhoods of L.A. (like Hollywood and Watts) and particular traditions of representing the city (as white middle-class fantasy, as border community, as global city). However, we’ll also discuss how a critical understanding of the mythology of L.A. might allow us to reevaluate American myths of newness and self-fashioning more generally.The course asks students to consider the extent to which our perception of a city is shaped not only by physical geography, but also by cultural representation: accordingly, although the syllabus includes readings in history and urban studies, our discussions will focus primarily on fictional depictions of the city. The course devotes special attention to film, a medium with unique ties to L.A.; students should plan to devote up to 6 hours per week to viewing the films.Required screenings:Charles Burnett, Killer of Sheep

A. GadberryIf the proliferation of floral print and crop tops or the planned remake of Point Break weren’t convincing enough, this fall’s fashion week paid homage to Sassy (beloved periodical of nineties teens), and the men’s magazine GQ joined the growing number of headlines in national newspapers and periodicals declaring that “we are likely entering a prolonged period of ’90s monomania.”This summer we’ll take our cue from this apparent pop culture imperative and examine novels, poetry, drama, film, television shows, albums, artworks, government documents, and the output of American news media as we analyze the roughly decade-long period between the falls of the Berlin Wall and the Twin Towers.  We’ll attempt to complicate facile accounts of the decade as we place the post-Cold-War dot-com-boom alongside the decade’s spectacular violence from Operation Desert Storm to the beating of Rodney King and subsequent LA Riots and many other events and scandals.  We will place particular emphasis on literary, artistic, and philosophical works and their relationship to popular culture, and our approach will be selective rather than exhaustive.  We’ll focus especially on race, ethnicity, and gender in the 1990s and on the aesthetics of grunge culture and Gen-X malaise.An abiding concern through our entire course will be in considering how the 1990s understood itself and how, or if, the apparent nostalgia for the ’90s in our present moment amounts to a longing for the decade George F. Will named, on September 12, 2001, “a holiday from history” (and we’ll test the legitimacy of Will’s assessment).  We’ll use close reading and rhetorical analysis to unfold texts literary and social, but we’ll also pose questions about periodization and ask how the invention of the Internet and the media of the 1990s constructed our perception of that historical moment, of the “real,” and of the continuities and discontinuities of the 1990s with the present.Assignments will include two short papers, a project, and several small assignments and creative exercises.In addition to some in-class screenings of TV episodes (e.g., My So-Called Life, Twin Peaks), music videos, and film, there will be weekly film screenings outside of our scheduled class time.  Students will be required to attend at least three of these outside screenings.  Some possible films for this series include: Greg Araki, The Living End (1992); Cameron Crowe, Singles (1992); Spike Lee, Get on the Bus (1996); Jennie Livingston, Paris is Burning (1990); Todd Solondz, Happiness (1998); Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994); and Larry and Andy Wachowski, The Matrix (1999).Required Works (available for purchase at ASUC Bookstore)Denis Johnson, Jesus’ Son

Emily LaskinThey say you can pick your friends, but can you pick your family? In this course, we’ll be reading about families of various kinds, from those who are stuck with each other because of biology, to those who end up together by accident or fate, and those who choose each other for their own reasons. We’ll consider what makes a family, and why the family unit—elective or not—is such a powerful setting for drama, fiction, and film. We’ll also consider how tensions and divisions arise within families, and whether a non-biological family is subject to the same forces as a biological one. From foundational Western “family dramas” to more contemporary portrayals of family, this course examines how politics, sexual orientation, war, and random circumstance work inside families as they work on the outside world.Since this is an R&C course, we’ll devote most of our time to close reading and intensive writing. The course will develop students’ abilities to read texts carefully, to examine both points of coherence and moments of tension within them, and to analyze the relationship between meaning and textual form. Its other major aim is to help students express increasingly complex ideas in writing. The various writing activities in the class, from the major analytical essays to shorter creative exercises, will connect critical thinking and writing, improve students’ control over their writing voice, and introduce new ways of thinking about structure and development.Reading list:

Laura WagnerCan a work of the imagination teach us anything about real life? Can literature make us better people or thinkers, and if so, how does it convey its moral or intellectual lessons? Or does it instead provide dangerous temptations and immoral models, leading readers astray? What distinguishes a good reader from a bad reader, and how do literary texts ask us to relate to their stories? How does the form of a literary text act on its readers? Where should we locate the value of a literary work: in the lessons it can teach us, in the entertainment it provides, in the beauty of its form and expression, or somewhere else?These are just some of the questions that we’ll explore in this course, and we’ll approach them by reading and discussing a range of novels, short stories, poems, plays, and essays from a number of literary traditions and time periods. We’ll look at texts that are skeptical about literature and its influence, meeting characters who overly-identify with the fictional worlds they consume in books and are led astray by bad reading practices. We’ll consider works that put forth defenses of literature and its educative potential and whose authors think literary texts, and art more generally, might be an essential part of our moral and political formation. We’ll also evaluate arguments about different types of literature, examining how the form of a text might help to enact the lessons its content seeks to convey.With these literary works as our common terrain, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading and analytical writing skills, learning to become more careful readers and to advance increasingly complex interpretive arguments about literary texts. Course requirements include active class participation, a diagnostic essay, a close reading paper, a midterm paper and final research paper (both of which will be revised), and frequent short analytical and creative writing assignments.Required Texts:

Nina EstreichIn this class, we will be thinking about representations of health and illness in a variety of texts. What are some of the ways in which the premise of an opposition between health and illness fundamentally shapes both social experience and literary imaginings? In our exploration of this question, we will take into account the ways in which various genres– including drama, poetry, novels, short stories, prose essays, visual arts, and film– frame the social meanings and significations of illness and debility. In our readings and discussions over the semester, we will address such topics as social identity, the relationships between individual and society, the private and the public, and various imaginings of community.This writing-intensive class satisfies half of the undergraduate R&C course requirement.Regular writing exercises and assignments will emphasize close reading and interpretive skills.Texts may include:Sophocles, Oedipus Rex
William Blake, Songs of Innocence and Experience
Rainer Maria Rilke, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge
Daniel Defoe, A Journal of the Plague Year

A rich literature explores experiences of migration. This course will focus upon literary treatments of
experiences of geographic movement and dislocation. We will also include in our exploration of
“migration” non-geographic experiences of border-crossings and dislocation, such as coming-out,
religious conversion, and grief. We will read contemporary novels of immigration, and examine a
number of other texts – poems, autobiographical essays, a film. The course includes, but does not focus
upon, immigration in a United States context. For example, the protagonist of one of our novels, The
Belly of The Atlantic, is a part of the Senegalese diaspora in France.

Keith BudnerThe aim of this class is less to study Rome and its history, and more to think about Rome as an idea. Why? Because it seems we are always – even if we don’t know it – thinking about Rome, or perhaps more accurately, we are always using Rome to think about other things.  From democratic-republicanism to imperialism and fascist dictatorships; wealthy disparity and class-conflict or patriotic unity; discipline and virtue or decadence and sexual depravity: the image of Rome calls upon all of these categories, despite their obvious contradictions.In our discussions we will consider how even in the Roman world, the many possibilities of Rome and ‘being Roman’ were imagined and re-imagined. As we move to later periods we will discuss not only how such possibilities were echoed or altered, but also ask to what ends this vocabulary of Rome was used, and why this imagery afforded something unique.Our primary tools of investigation will be literary texts that span from Roman antiquity well into the modern day; they will comprise a variety of genres (poetry, novels, plays, etc.) and move from the high-literary to pop-culture. As such, we will also consider visual media including films, as well as paintings, architecture, and images of political processions from various periods, in particular Renaissance Europe, the revolutionary periods of France and the United States, and the fascist years of Germany, Italy, and Spain.As a Reading and Composition course, our comparative analyses will always be guided toward building our skills as critical readers and writers. We will come to appreciate that like Rome, an essay is not built in a day. And just as Rome is always being imagined and re-imagined, what we articulate in thought will go through various stages of pre-writing, writing, and revision. Moreover by having in Rome a constant yet nebulous focal point, the course also hopes to show the complexities and benefits of both literary and comparative analysis.Major texts include:Apuleius. The Golden Ass
Shakespeare. Titus Andronicus
Cervantes. Siege of Numantia
Henrik Ibsen. Emperor and Galilean
Albert Camus. Caligula
Ursula K. Le Guin. LaviniaWe will also have a course reading with excerpts from the following works:Livy. History of Rome
Virgil. Aeneid, Eclogues
Letters of Cicero, Seneca, and Petrarch
Augustine. The City of God Against the Pagans
Boccaccio. Decameron

Kirsten SchwartzIn this class we will explore themes of Love and sometimes Love connected with Death; we’ll also try to find “the point” of each text we read.  We begin with a very early love poem by the ancient Greek woman Sappho, move into Plato (Platonic love:  more lusty than people think), through Roman love lyric, into later (19th century) English love poetry until we finally come into the twentieth century and read three short novels.  We’ll make a major stop along the way for Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, accompanied by a close look at a cinematic observation of that story, Shakespeare in Love.  As far as love itself goes, I don’t know what love is, because it is a mystery, but I do know it’s interesting to explore what writers in Western literature have thought about it; maybe we’ll come up with some answers by the end of the semester.  Meanwhile, you’ll be writing many short essays as well as having in-class conversations about What The Point Of Each Text Might Be.  The three main essays will be on Plato’s Phaedrus dialogue, on Romeo and Juliet and Shakespeare, and on The Left Hand of Darkness–a novel in which a human man must live among human-like beings who have neither sex nor gender, except for three days once a month.  A final essay will finish our course with a synthesis of four texts that you found most interesting, challenging, revealing, fun–or all of those.REQUIRED TEXTS (aside from Reader, all can be purchased from Amazon; used copies okay as long as they are the correct edition, so ISBN numbers are supplied) :1.  Reader, including Plato’s Phaedrus and poems by Catullus, Ovid, Christina Rossetti and Matthew Arnold (source TBA).2.  Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, Dover Thrift Edition ($1.35): ISBN 0486275574.3.  Lawrence Thornton, Imagining Argentina ($11.45), ISBN 0553345796.4.  Ursula K.

Narratives preoccupied with how to recover and retell a lost story.  Museum installations that assemble and remake remnants of a past. Anthropologists obsessed with documenting threatened cultures before they presumably disappear. What do these imply about questions of rescue, recovery, and reuse? What happens
when we ‘salvage’ something—an object, a history, a culture—and what does this practice These are just some of the questions we will explore alongside our intensive work on writing. This course fulfills the first half of the University Reading & Composition (R&C) requirement, and we will dedicate ample time to critical thinking and essay-writing skills, paying special attention
to argumentation, analysis, and the basics of college-level writing.Texts and Materials:“Diving into the Wreck,” Adrienne Rich
“Everyday Use,” Alice Walker
The Invention of Morel, Adolfo Bioy Casares
City of Glass, David Mazzucchelli
Chopper! Chopper!, Verónica Reyes
Dictee, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha

The Heights of Macchu Picchu/Las Alturas de Macchu Picchu, Pablo Neruda
The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Díaz
Waste Land, Dir. Lucy Walker
Excerpts from works by James Clifford, Diana Taylor, and Marianne HirschMany of the materials above will be included in our course reader, which will be available at Zee Zee Copy, 2431-C Durant Avenue.  Visual materials will be available through our bCourses site.
Course Objectives:Skills that we will build together include. . .Close Reading: Close reading is all about paying attention and taking the time to notice and consider elements of a text, material, or film that may not be obvious at first glance. It begins when you read and observe with care, making notes, jotting down questions, and paying attention to a text or film’s devices and themes. It then involves choosing certain passages or elements to analyze in detail.Critical Thinking: Critical thinking is challenging because it requires us to move beyond our assumptions and engage what we read and see with an open mind and a critical eye.  It involves asking many questions and considering multiple, even conflicting ‘answers’ in the process of thinking about what a text or image might convey and how it seems to function.Critical thinking also requires that we examine the assumptions that are built into or implied by a work or argument.Formulating and Articulating Arguments: Every paper that you write in this class will require you to make, support, and develop a unique argument.  When you make an argument, you make a claim rather than describe or repeat, and you work with evidence to support this claim.  Learning how to formulate and articulate arguments involves more than listing your ideas about a text or
material; we need to present these ideas in a focused and organized way.  Working with arguments will also require you to support your claim with evidence, showing your audience that you have reasons, close-readings, and examples to back up your ideas.Class discussion and dialogue: Our classroom will be a space for sharing ideas, asking questions, listening to each other, and contemplating different points of view. This is not a lecture course; our goal is to form an intellectual community that dialogues and collaborates. Much of our classroom time will be spent discussing in groups large and small, and discussion boards on bCourses will provide opportunities for us to exchange ideas about what are reading and prepare for our in-class discussions. We will also participate in Reading Circles, small groups of four to six students who read and research one of the materials on our syllabus and then lead our class discussion of that text or material.Assignments & Grading:One three-page diagnostic essay Required
Two four-page papers (drafts & final versions)* 60 points
One six-page paper (draft & final version)* 60 points
Circle Group work (meeting & presentation) 20 points
Frequent short writing assignments 20 pointsAttendance 20 points
Participation 20 points
Total possible: 200 pointsYou must complete all paper and revision assignments in order to pass this class.  This includes the diagnostic essay, which, although not assigned a letter grade, is a required * Drafts are worth 50% of a total paper grade (for example, 15 points out of 30).Accommodations: If you need disability-related accommodations in this class, request them from the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) and inform the instructor within the first two weeks of the semester. The DSP office is responsible for verifying that students have disability-related needs and for planning appropriate accommodations in cooperation with the students
themselves and their instructors. DSP: 230 César Chávez Student Center, 510-642-0518 (voice) and 510-642-6376 (TTY).Attendance: Students are expected to attend all class sessions and come to class having read and thought about the readings and materials assigned. Class begins promptly, and attendance will be taken at every class session. If you are not present when roll is called (i.e. you are absent or late), you will be marked as absent. More than 1 absence will impact your grade, as each additional one reduces your attendance score (worth a total of 20 points out of 200) by 4Participation: This is a discussion-driven course, and your active participation is key. In-class participation can take many forms, including voicing an observation, offering a comment, posing a question, responding to a classmate’s idea, or volunteering to read aloud. Group work and in-class peer review activities also count toward your participation grade, as do discussions through bCourses.Because this is a discussion-driven course, we will use our class time to focus on sharing and engaging ideas.  In order to minimize distractions, laptop computers are not permitted in the classroom. Text messaging is also not allowed, as your cell phones should be turned off and put away.Late Assignments:  Unless otherwise stated in course materials, all assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date assigned. If a student submits a late assignment, it will be graded, but the grade will be reduced a third of a letter grade for each calendar day or portion thereof that the assignment is late. For example, a paper that is two days late and earns an A-Submitting Assignments: Except for essays marked for electronic submission (see course schedule), you must submit hardcopies of all assignments. In the case of essays due electronically, these must be emailed to the instructor as Microsoft Word documents and time-stamped by 3 p.m. on the specified due date.Academic Integrity and Plagiarism: The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted an Honor Code that states, “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”  The hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code and that an attitude of honesty, integrity, and respect will shape all your interactions with your classmates and their ideas, as well as your engagements with the materials that we study this.   To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action.  For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see: http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/instruct/guides/citations.html#Plagiarismhttp://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.htmlCOURSE SCHEDULEThis schedule is tentative and will be modified according to our needs as a class. Short writing assignments and bCourse discussion prompts may not be listed here but are announced in class.  Reading indicates the assigned reading for the next class. Come to the next class ready to go.Writing indicates a writing assignment due at the next class session. Unless the assignment is
marked for electronic submission, print and bring a hardcopy to class.

Paco BritoWhat role should literature play in our lives? Does reading and discussing literature make us better people, better thinkers, better citizens? Or is attempting to extract some sort of use for literature a mistake, a misapprehension of something that has no purpose but that is good or pleasure in and of itself? Even more fundamentally, what counts as literature? Is there a class of truly “literary” works that can be isolated from the larger field of textual production? Is verse more literary than prose? Is fiction more literary than nonfiction writing?These are just some of the questions that we’ll be asking in this course. We’ll approach them by engaging a broad range of poems, novels, and stories as well as by surveying key texts in the history of theorization about literature, from Plato’s warnings about the dangers of literature to present-day attempts to demonstrate that reading certain kinds of texts confers moral and cognitive advantages.As this is a course on reading and composition, it will also be writing intensive. Not only will we inquire into the nature and value of literature, we’ll also focus on the process of writing–on the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader.Texts will include:-Poetry by Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and César Vallejo.
-Essays and theoretical work by Plato, Percy Shelley, Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Marilynne Robinson, and Zadie Smith.
-Short fiction by Heinrich von Kleist, Honoré de Balzac, Jorge Luis Borges, Deborah Eisenberg, and David Foster Wallace.
-The films 8 ½ by Federico Fellini and Barton Fink by Joel and Ethan Coen.
-The novels To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf, Leaving the Atocha Station by Ben Lerner, and excerpts from The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bolaño.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Margarita Gordon, Nicole Jones2015-16 R1A Course DescriptionPERSONS/PERSONAS“Now the whole life of mortal men, what is it but a sort of play, in which various persons make their entrances in various  costumes, and each one plays his own part until the director gives him his cue to leave the stage? Often he also orders one and the same actor to come on in different costumes, so that the actor who just now played the king in royal scarlet now comes on in rags to play a miserable servant. True, all these images are unreal, but this play cannot be performed in any other way.”—Erasmus, The Praise of Folly (1511)Considering that we tend to think of personas as extraneous to persons or personalities, it may come as a surprise that the word person etymologically derives from the word persona rather than the other way around. This Latin term refers to the masks originally worn by actors in Greek, and later Roman, drama, by which the audience was able to identify the characters (or types) they represented. At the same time, the holes in these masks amplified the sound of the actors’ own voices (per sonare meaning to sound through).This class will be devoted to exploring personas as acts or roles that simultaneously conceal and reveal the people behind them and also to exploring the collaborations between actors, directors, and audiences that produce these them. What personas, we will ask ourselves, are being crafted in our texts? Who crafts or projects them and to what personal, political, or aesthetic ends? What influence do context and culture have? Are these impersonations performed successfully? How are multiple personas reconciled with one another, or with a “true” self? How, indeed, do we, or can we even, differentiate between the person and the persona?Already in the Classical period, personas became associated not just with role-play in the theater but with role-play in everyday life. Thus, in exploring the personas featured on our syllabus, we can reflect on those all of us, whether or not we’re aware of it, perform in our own lives: in our various relationships, in our work, and online. Who are we, really?Texts may include:Erving Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life

Jessica Crewe & Cory MerrillTales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”?  How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.Texts May Include:Shakespeare, The Tempest

This term has become so prevalent that New Yorker writer Rebecca Mead has recently decried the “scourge of relatability” that has come to afflict contemporary culture. But what does it mean to be “relatable”? Why is this something we look for in a work of art? What, if anything, is wrong with expecting or seeking out “relatability”? Is this a new phenomenon or an age-old one?In this class we will examine texts from a range of time periods and cultural traditions in attempts to elucidate how the contemporary use of “relatable,” meaning inviting identification, might relate to the word’s original meaning, which was closer to “tellable,” or capable of being related in narrative. Does a text that bars us from identifying with it through difficult form or unlikeable characters necessarily jeopardize its ability to tell a tale? Why might some tales resist being relatable in either sense? How might a text’s refusal of “relatability” help us to recognize and respect cultural difference, to question our right to know another’s story, or to appreciate indirect or non-narrative ways in which deeply personal or traumatic experiences might be transmitted?In fulfillment of the Reading and Composition requirement, this class aims to improve the students’ abilities to think rigorously and write clearly about subjects of intellectual complexity in order to prepare them for the demands of college-level coursework. Significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to close read a literary text, articulate an interpretive argument, and write a clear and compelling analytical paper.Required Texts:William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of King Lear
Mary Shelley, Frankenstein
William Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!

Keith FordMemory is essential for personal and cultural identity; and memory is, for the most part, constructed as a narrative. Our sense of who we are – as individuals and as members of groups – depends upon the stories we tell about ourselves: stories that establish continuities over time, assign meanings to certain experiences, and create values.  Individual or cultural amnesia signifies a loss of identity, and a dangerous condition of disorientation in the world. But the intimate relationship between memory and narrative raises several pressing epistemological questions. What is the relationship between memory and history? What happens when memory exists in tension (or contradiction) with public history or the historical archive? How does the structuring of memory through narrative forms and conventions affect what is remembered and the meanings that the past holds for us? How does the imperative to remember an occasion come into conflict with the desire or need to forget? In this course we will consider a series of narrative texts – literary and cinematic – that thematize memory and problematize the space between memory and invention.This is also a writing intensive course with several essay assignments. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will learn how to articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studyingTexts for the course are likely to include selections from Odyssey, The Aeneid, and Confessions, Petrarch’s “Ascent of Mt. Ventoux,” Du Bellay’s “Regrets,” Absalom, Absalom!, The Storyteller, Cold Mountain as well as some short stories, poems, and films.

Tyleen KellyIn Anna Karenina Tolstoy’s speaker humorously initiates with: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Perhaps the most riddling element is what sorts of bonds keep unhappy families in close proximity, and how might we create a taxonomy of their conflicts? This course will examine family stories written in narrative and dramatic form, and will uncover the distinct challenges (or particular suitability) each of these forms experiences on the page as it tries to give voice to a complex network of family members.

Mary Renolds & Paul De MoraisAs Benedict Anderson reminds us in Imagined Communities, “the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communication.” How do we construct this image of our fellow community members?  What are the consequences of imagining them rather than meeting them? What happens to individuals that the community as a whole would prefer not to imagine? Is there a way to overcome the limits of such a community? And, finally, is this phenomenon limited to our own communities, or do Anderson’s words hold true on an international, or even a global, scale? This course will seek to answer these questions, with a particular focus on the roles that literature, film, and other media play in the building of imagined communities, as we work our way through diverse texts selected from a time period spanning hundreds of years. Along the way, we will learn how to engage closely with these texts in order to develop, refine, and defend solid literary arguments.Required Books:

C. SchollIn this course, we will explore the relationship between how literary empires are forged and how they are challenged. Reading texts regarded as classics of the Western canon* alongside 20th– and 21st-century texts from Africa and the Americas produced in self-conscious relationship to the earlier works, we will consider the ways in which narratives are transformed by authors writing from different historical and cultural locations. In doing so, we will see that, in fact, the canonical pre-texts are also appropriating and rewriting narratives generated by Europe’s imperial expansion—meaning that all of the texts we will be reading are in some sense postcolonial rewritings.This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on the practice of global revision/rewriting as a fundamental part of the writing process. Students will learn how to develop interesting arguments about the texts we are studying and how to refine these ideas through their drafting and revision of several analytical essays.* Canon: “A body of literary works traditionally regarded as the most important, significant, and worthy of study; those works of especially Western literature considered to be established as being of the highest quality and most enduring value; the classics (now freq. in the canon)” (OED). From ancient Greek kanon, meaning a “reed” or “rod” used as an instrument of measurement. Possibly derived from kanna, the etymological origin of both cannon, the heavy artillery used in European imperial expansion, and of the sugar cane that played a significant role in motivating and fueling the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism in the Caribbean.Possible textual pairings include:Homer, The Iliad and The Odyssey (selections) / Derek Walcott, Omeros (selections)
Michel de Montaigne, “Of Cannibals” / Oswald de Andrade, “The Cannibalist Manifesto”
William Shakespeare, The Tempest / Aimé Césaire, A Tempest
William Shakespeare, Othello / Toni Morrison and Rokia Traoré, Desdemona
Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe / J. M. Coetzee, Foe
Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights / Maryse Condé, Windward Heights (La migration des cœurs)

G. Page & K. FordThis course will focus on the relations between literature, history, and cosmopolitanism. We will read a selection of literary texts produced in the greater Atlantic region – Europe, North America, the Caribbean, and Africa – since the arrival of the Europeans in the Americas. The history of conquest, colonialism, plantation slavery, decolonization, and postcolonial migration makes the Atlantic region a zone of cultural exchange and creolization. As we read literary narratives that represent lives conditioned by this Atlantic history we will reflect on the concept of cosmopolitanism, interrogating the role that literature might play in producing transnational or cosmopolitan modes of thinking and feeling.Primary readings will likely include The Tempest, Robinson Crusoe, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, The Kingdom of this World, Home to Harlem, Voyage in the Dark, and White Teeth, but students should wait until the first day of class before purchasing the texts. This is also a writing intensive course with several essay assignments. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will learn how to articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying.

Ashley BrockWhat family isn’t steeped in lore, haunted by skeletons in the closet, or delighted by its own humorous anecdotes no matter how many times they’ve been told? In this class we will explore the singular relationship between the family and story telling. What does it mean to understand family identity as a form of narrative? How does family identity intersect with individual identity, cultural identity, and national identity?  To what extent do the stories that are passed down through our families shape who we are and determine what kind of a world we inherit? What is the importance of unearthing, reconstructing, telling, and re-telling the stories of how our families came to be?These are some of the questions we will address while examining texts from a wide range of time periods and cultural traditions. In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument. To this end, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling argumentative paper.Texts may include the work of: Sophocles, William Shakespeare, Clarice Lispector, William Faulkner, Gayl Jones, Marjane Satrapi, Sherman Alexie, Tillie Olsen, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and David Chase.

J. VakninWe tend to think about illness in biological and epidemiological terms; much of our knowledge about health is communicated through the language of medicine and science—we look to doctors, pharmacists, nutritionists, and a range of other experts when seeking advice on how to lead a healthy life. But can science fully convey what it means to be ill? In this class, we will pay close attention to the ways in which illness gets represented in culture. From Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Freud’s Studies on Hysteria to Camus’s The Plague and Lorde’s The Cancer Journals, our readings will be guided by the following questions: How does illness affect one’s sense of self? How have conceptions of illness—and health—changed over time? What are the political dimensions of health? What relationships can we identify between illness and literary form? What role does figurative language play in accounts of illness? And how does health status intersect with other modalities of difference, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and class?As part of the University’s R&C sequence, this course is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical writing and reading skills. In addition to regular attendance and participation, requirements include a series of essays—drafts and revisions—and short response papers.Texts will be drawn from the following*:William Shakespeare, Hamlet
Audre Lorde, The Cancer Journals
Albert Camus, The Plague
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, “White Glasses” in Tendencies
Jamaica Kincaid, My Brother
Roberto Bolaño, “Literature + Illness = Illness” in The Insufferable Gaucho

M. RenoldsThis course will focus on the literature of two major empires – Russia and Britain – and will examine how these empires use literature to create the “identity” of those living in the empires’ respective colonies. What is an empire, and what is a nation? How is literature used to understand another culture? Is that understanding always (or ever) accurate? How does literature influence, or even create, our views of other nations, or even our views of our own nation? How are stereotypes, misunderstandings, and fabrications used for personal or national gain? And what happens when those who are stereotyped are finally given the chance to speak with their own voices? We will contemplate these questions, and others, as we work our way through diverse texts chosen from a time period spanning more than three hundred years. Along the way, we will learn how to engage closely with the texts in order to develop, refine, and defend solid literary arguments.Texts:William Shakespeare, The Tempest

K. BudnerWe often imagine reading to be a private and personal matter.  We all have our own favorite novels, and when we want time alone, curling up with a book is never a bad option.  Yet this course hopes to explore how reading literature informs our place within groups, within homes and families, cities, nations, and a host of other collective categories.   The works we will read will span Ancient Rome to South America, each one offering a unique perspective on how being part of a community both provides opportunities and sets limitations, how it both requires conformity yet creates the possibility for expressing ourselves to others.At the same time, a central concern of the course will be how literature itself is frequently grouped within ‘conventional’ categories or generic communities.  From this angle we will investigate how literary and creative acts – storytelling, theatrical performances, the writing of history, etc. – play a fundamental role in constituting group identity.Texts may include from among the following:Literature –
Henrik Ibsen. Rosmersholm
Plautus. The Captives
William Shakespeare. Coriolanus
El Cid
Catalina de Erauso. The Lieutenant Nun
Eclogues by Theocritus and Virgil
Faulkner. The Bear
Gabriel García Marquez. One Hundred Years of Solitude
Euripides. Trojan WomenPhilosophy and Theory –
Freud. Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego
Søren Kierkegaard. “Crop Rotation”
Seneca. Letters
Plato, Aristotle, and ThucydidesFilm and Television –
Lars von Trier’s Dogville

Andrea Gadberry & Jocelyn Saidenberg“The way down to hell is easy…” – Virgil, Aeneid 6.126“Does the Eagle know what is in the pit?” – William Blake, The Book of ThelThis semester we will plunge into the abyss, taking our cue from many distinguished literary trailblazers as we study critical reading and composition.  Since antiquity, epic heroes have gone to hell (or Hades) and back: Odysseus goes to the underworld, Aeneas follows his example, and Dante heads to hell, and, more recently, Alice Notley’s Alette descends into subterranean New York, to name just a few examples. This course takes katabasis, or the descent to the underworld, as its point of departure for its study of descents into depths literal and figurative.  In poems, novels, plays, and works of art, we will study the spelunkings of heroes epic and otherwise into abysses below and within.  We will explore the encounter between life and death that katabasis dramatizes, and we will ask what sort of knowledge an abyss might offer – or what kind of “gazing” an abyss might be able to do.  What is the relationship between the underworld and the world above, and how does the experience of descent shape the return (for those who do return)?  What are the qualities of the protagonists who plumb these depths?  How might a literary investigation of the deepest fathoms help us understand the forms of the unfathomable?We will also apply the attentive gaze we cast into the abyss to the art of writing.  Over a series of short essays and slightly longer papers, students will practice expository writing and close reading, studying the craft of producing argumentative essays sustained by careful readings.  In addition to these written assignments, students should expect to participate actively in class discussions and make an oral presentation. ReadingsAristophanes, FrogsDjuna Barnes, NightwoodDante, InfernoHomer, Odyssey, Book 11Carl Jung, “Picasso” (1932)Alice Notley, The Descent of AletteOvid, Metamorphoses, Book 10Pablo Picasso, Paintings (Blue Period)Arthur Rimbaud, A Season in HellThomas De Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium-EaterJean-Paul Sartre, No ExitVirgil, Aeneid, Book 6William Blake, The Book of Thel A course reader will include some of the texts above as well as works by Mikhail Bakhtin, Sigmund Freud, and Jalal Toufic.CL R1A:3

L. Wagner In this course, we will consider a range of texts that challenge us to engage critically with the act of reading itself.  From unreliable narrators to mystified characters, from wordplay to narrative holes, from histories of trauma to postmodern detective stories, these texts complicate and frustrate our initial attempts at interpretation.  And yet it is through their gaps, silences, and ambiguities that these works retrain their readers in the art of reading, forcing us to pay close attention not only to their meaning, but also to the manner in which they create (or obscure) this meaning.  As we interrogate the very process of reading, we will seek to develop a careful and critical stance not only as readers of fiction but also as writers of our own analytical prose. Texts and films will be chosen from among the following:The Marquise of O—, Heinrich von KleistThe Unknown Masterpiece, Honoré de BalzacBeloved, Toni MorrisonThe Crying of Lot 49, Thomas PynchonAtonement, Ian McEwanRope, Alfred HitchcockThe Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer A course reader will include excerpts from Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, short stories such as “The Vane Sisters” by Vladimir Nabokov, “The Figure in the Carpet” by Henry James, and “Eckbert the Fair” by Ludwig Tieck, and poetry such as “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer” by John Keats. CL R1A:3

Margaret Gordon & Keith BudnerThis is a course about people who fall short, plans that go bust, and stories that don’t turn out like you thought they would. Not that you’ll be spending the semester suffering through a series of tragic disappointments. For as we explore the making and unmaking of lofty ambitions, romantic aspirations, prophecies, and personal and collective ideals, we will also be questioning whether they’re all they’re cracked up to be, or even worth pursuing in the first place. Where do these enthralling, often crushing expectations come from? In what way do they shape our attitudes towards the past, the present, and the future? How are they framed within artistic works? With what preconceptions do we approach these works, and how might the works respond to them? Whether as characters, narratives, or readers, could going halfway, amiss, in the opposite direction, or nowhere at all towards fulfilling expectations—going somewhere completely unexpected—bring its own rewards?A significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing and revising three papers as well as completing a number of short writing assignments.

Gabe Page & Caitlin SchollThis is a course about the pleasure particular to reading and reflecting on literary texts, especially those short narrative texts known as tales. It is about learning to become the kind of reader capable of being seduced by a literary text: by its language, plot, sheer inventiveness – even by its ambiguity. This course will also serve as an introduction to world literature. We will read tales from around the world and across the ages: folk tales, epic tales, strange and fantastic tales, metaphysical parables, travel tales, tales of crime and detection, the realist short story, and postmodern metafictional narratives. We will discuss the differences between oral tales and written tales, and the ways in which oral structures are presented in many of the literary texts we will be reading. This is also a writing intensive course; while not everyone immediately associates writing with pleasure, we will approach writing as an activity of experimentation and discovery – never easy, sometimes frustrating, but truly exhilarating when we finally find the language to give form to our experience of a literary text, enabling us to communicate that experience to others.Readings are likely to include selections from The Odyssey, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Chuang Tzu, A Thousand and One Nights, the Ramayana, The Decameron, various Romantic narrative poems, the Sunjata and Mwindo epics, short stories by Poe, Gogol, Diop, Borges, and Calvino, Kafka’s parables, Chamoiseau’s Solibo Magnificent, and Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard. We will complement our literary readings with theoretical essays by Vladimir Propp, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Peter Brooks, Walter Ong, and others.CL R1A:5

Sydney Cochran and Diana ThowIn this course we will consider madness in its many forms and characterizations in literature, film, and visual art.  Our study, however, will not be of madness itself so much as the way it exemplifies the close connection, for all of us, between what we see and the imaginative lens through which we see it.We will meet Don Quixote who, pathetic or profound, sees a world that is precisely as romantic as he wishes it to be, and a Little Prince who knows for certain, when looking at a sketch of a wooden box with holes, that inside that box is a live sheep. We’ll listen to the townspeople, in “The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World,” as they re-imagine the village they thought they knew in the course of telling to each other the likely story of the dead body that washes up one day on their beach.  We will watch as the narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper” encounters successive new versions of herself in the paper that covers her room.As we examine the texts before us, we will consider how the process of reading fiction and of viewing art is also an exercise of the imagination: the worlds and characters we “see” before us are worlds and characters we ourselves, in part, create.  What does it mean to read?  What is the place and the process of interpretation?  And how do our interpretations of art impact the world we encounter and the self we create when we leave the classroom?  Is reading any less a process of intellectual creation than the one of writing: that exercise by which we give form and shape to our interpretations—represent and communicate to others what we see in the art we analyze?This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, interpretation, and research.WRITTEN TEXTS:FILMS:­CL R1A:6

Paco Brito & Marianne KaletskySome texts have the ability to confound us. A hole in the plot, an unresolved ending, a word that feels wrong: these moments of ambiguity can frustrate our attempts to pin down what a text is really saying. But such riddles can also spark our curiosity and deepen our understanding of how literature works.Each of the texts we’re reading presents an insoluble mystery. In some, we can’t distinguish between fantasy and reality. Others challenge our moral intuitions. And some revel in the obscurity of a crucial word, event, or character. These texts are ideally suited for close reading and careful interpretation. The central focus of the class will be to help students write analytical essays in response to the texts. Texts will include:Novels:The Kingdom of this World by Alejo CarpentierThe Turn of the Screw by Henry JamesBeloved by Toni MorrisonFilms:Do the Right Thing by Spike LeeMulholland Drive by David LynchSolaris by Andrei TarkovskyDrama:A Midsummer Night’s Dream by William ShakespearePoetry by A.

R. Lorenz & J. NelsenIn this course, we will read stories of people seduced away from a well-balanced life by the allures of beauty, art, revenge, sex, sentiment—or even by rational thought pushed to extremes. Although we could label these characters as mentally ill, many of the texts we will read portray their deviance as an ambiguous sort of exaltation. Accordingly, we will analyze how each text presents the terrible costs of losing grip, as well as how the characters, from the point of view of their extreme principles, offer a twisted justification for the unbalanced life.These texts will offer stimulating material for the primary aim of the course, which is to teach you how to write convincing essays filled with intelligent analysis and argument. A considerable amount of class time will thus be devoted explicitly to writing instruction, so that you can exit the course with some well-honed and very useful practical skills. As in all R & C courses, 32 pages of writing are required, including first drafts and rewrites.Texts:Euripides, Medea

Jessie HockCourse Description: In The Republic, Plato condemps poetry for being too far removed from reality. A feeble imitation of the world (itself an imitation of ideal Ideas), poetry isn’t “true,” distorting human understanding of the world influence on young people to behave badly. In the Poetics, Aristotle argues that didactic, or scientific, verse isn’t really poetry. From the Greeks onwards, we have tended to distinguish poetry and science as different modes of thought with different relationships to truth or the real, and different functions in society. This course will take a long view of this troubled history and read classic scientific writings, poetry, and poetic theory to question the traditional generic boundaries between scientific and literary texts and practices. From the farming manual that is Virgil’s Georgics to contemporary scholarship that uses neurological advances to analyze literature to science fiction from all periods, we will question the boundaries between science and literature and the practice of each. Reading List:Readings will likely include selections from the following works and authors, among others.

Philip Gerard“The power of debt is described as if it were exercised neither through repression nor through ideology. The debtor is “free,” but his actions, his behavior, are confined to the limits defined by the debt he has entered into.”– Maurizio Lazzarato, The Making of Indebted ManDebt is a way of life. In California, 50% of college seniors who graduated from non-profit institutions last year left school with some form of student debt. From this pool, the average obligation comes out to $20,250. As any 19th century novelist could tell you, this is an auspicious way to begin a story.In this Reading and Composition course we will pursue the topic of debt beyond the bounds of economics. From social obligations to moral duty, from financial lending to literary borrowing, we will examine the meaning(s) and genesis of debt as a concept and a metaphor. As we go over our own set of books, drawing on a series of artistic, anthropological and philosophical treatments of debt from a range of historical periods, we will refine our critical reading skills and study the art of making and defending an argument.As we explore the sorts of obligations that bind us, we will also be studying the craft of writing and revising an analytical paper. Students can expect to write and revise two papers, give an in-class presentation, and complete several smaller assignments.Books

Jane RaischStudying about vacation – during vacation – can sound like a contradiction. We think of vacations as escapes from study, as existing separately from our lives as students. But, as we all know too well, sometimes these two worlds necessarily collide and in this class we’ll develop oral and written tools of analysis to help us understand and come to terms with what it means to be on vacation. Does vacation require something exceptional: travel, beaches, family and/or friends?Or, is vacation simply a state of mind? We’ll think about different forms of “time-off” by going back to Classical festivals and Medieval pilgrimages, and from there ask how modern day vacations might retain elements (either subversive or sacred) of these pre-modern religious celebrations. How do both function as breaks from the norm, that temporarily sanction or limit experiences, behaviors, and encounters incompatible with everyday life?We’ll go on to consider both positive and negative depictions of vacation and ask whether vacations are inherently appealing, socially mandated, or both. As we continue to examine our own position as students, we’ll read texts in which education and extended travel are deeply interconnected. Are vacations actually contradictory to education, or do they just offer a different kind? Finally, we’ll consider whether vacations are ever all they’re cracked up to be or whether they are by definition utopian, more fantasy than reality and bound not to live up to our expectations.Since this is a reading and composition course, we’ll use these questions, and others raised by the texts, to develop and hone our skills as active readers and analytical writers. To this end, students will be expected to thoroughly read all assigned texts, attend class regularly, participate in class discussion, and complete a variety of written assignments.Texts:Thomas Mann, Death in Venice

Marianne KaletskyFandom gets a bad name in the academic world. Literary scholars pride themselves on their analytical approach to, and critical distance from, works already recognized as high art. Fans, on the other hand, throw themselves into the least esteemed genres and forms.Yet scholarship can’t entirely shake its ties to fandom. The history of the Western novel begins with a fan, Don Quixote, who devotes his life to the seventeenth-century equivalent of a Star Trek convention: dressing up as a character from the stories he loves. Many texts beloved by scholars have their origins in fandom, with authors so fascinated by their predecessors that they reinterpret their work. And literary criticism, no matter how objective it may seem, always depends on a reader’s often emotional, sometimes fanatical attachment to a text. So what’s the difference between a work of fan fiction and an artistic reinterpretation? And where’s the boundary between a fan and a critic?This course will explore fandom as both a literary theme and a literary habit. Some texts we’ll read are populated by obsessive fans who can’t stop referencing their favorite works; other texts are themselves obsessive fans who can’t stop referencing their favorite works. The majority of our readings fall into both categories.Since this is an R and C course, its major goals are to improve students’ skills in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, and to explore the relationship between the three. In addition to discussing the texts in class, students will write responses to them in a variety of forms, from literary analysis essays to a creative work of fan fiction.Required texts:Alison Bechdel, Fun Home

Laura WagnerThis course will examine texts that are concerned with the education of their characters. We’ll look at the literary representation of various sites of schooling across multiple continents and centuries, from the governess-run nursery to the urban public school, from the boarding school to the world beyond its walls, and we’ll ask what can be learned and taught within these spaces, and also why some texts might make us skeptical about them. We’ll consider how these texts reflect on and enact the development—or, in some cases, the dissolution— of the young protagonists whom we follow through their pages, and we’ll move through the perspectives of the child, the adolescent, and the educator to question how and where significant life lessons are learned. We’ll also interrogate why these works of fiction take such an interest in narratives of personal development and how they envision their own role in such a formative process. To this end, the course will encourage self-reflective practice among its members, asking how encounters with fictional worlds might factor into our own continuing self-formation. Most importantly, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading and analytical writing skills with these fictions of education as our common terrain, learning to become more careful readers and thinkers and to advance increasingly complex interpretive arguments about literary texts.Required Texts:The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Muriel Spark

Jordan GreenwaldThis course will examine a long legacy of cultural fascination with domestic space and its iconic caretaker, the housewife. We will discuss literary texts and films that feature housewives as their protagonists, from Milton to Virginia Woolf to the present. Our task will be twofold: we will work to appreciate, on the one hand, how the texts engage with a longstanding (and ongoing) feminist critique of the tethering of women to domestic labor; on the other hand, we will try to understand why the housewife endures as a key aspect of the fantasy of “the good life.” What can literary representations of housewives tell us about the aspirations and assumptions surrounding our everyday lives – in the past and in the present?This is a writing-intensive course, and we will explore all of these issues as a means of refining writing skills. Students will write and re-write a number of essays, and writing “workshops” will occur on a weekly basis. The final portion of the course will be spent on developing research skills, and will culminate in a research paper on one of the texts we have studied.Required Texts:Henrik Ibsen, A Doll’s House

Diana ThowTranslation is everywhere.  But what is it, exactly?  The term is often used to indicate anything transferred, adapted, communicated, displaced or interpreted. What does it mean to be “lost in translation”?  What is the difference between a translator and an author?  In this class we will examine translation as a creative process that bears meaning from one language to another, and think about the wide variety of metaphors implied by the term. We will also examine the figure of the translator in a broad range of literary texts and films in an effort to understand how translation, as a metaphor and a practice, enables movement, transferal, transformation, adaptation, interpretation, but also loss.In addition to our examination of the figures and metaphors of translation, this class will approach translation as an analytical tool of comparison and close reading.  Over the course of the semester we will read many works of literature in translation and perform close comparative analyses of various versions of the same translated passages.  In performing these comparative analyses we will think about translation as a model of close reading, a way of getting to know the text from the inside out. Since our focus in this class will be to hone our analytical reading and writing skills, translation will also provide us with a model of how to make interpretative claims about the meaning of a text in an engaged, creative, and productive way.Required texts will be selected from the following:William Shakespeare, The Tempest

Howard Fisher“There are many understandings.” – Jeffrey DolvenHow do teachers know that their students understand? I may be satisfied if you repeat my words back to me just as I spoke them, but do you really get it? And how do I know that you, thinking you understand, won’t go and apply what I’ve taught you in a way I hadn’t intended?  In this class we will analyze texts that explore what happens when teaching gets away from the teacher. From classical rhetoric manuals to wiki how-to’s and from Douglass’ stolen writing handbook to Baltimore’s public school classrooms, we will examine the demands of pedagogy and the need for learning to exceed the parameters set for it.Focusing on works of literature, philosophy, and pedagogical theory from different centuries and linguistic traditions, this course aims primarily to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Specific units will address the historical relationship between formal education and literature, the role of education in reproducing dominant ways of thinking, and the stake of education in social justice. The course as a whole aims to encourage students to reflect on what they hope to achieve through their education as well as how different “scenes of instruction” structure what counts as knowledge and what learning looks like. With these goals in mind, members of this course will be asked to illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, periodic posts to a bcourses forum, and consistent in-class participation.Required Texts:

While many domestic texts conclude with an affirmation of the importance of family solidarity and security, we will focus instead on novels, plays, and films about unhappy families. What formal and stylistic methods do the writers of these texts use to engage reader sympathy for their characters? How do novelists and playwrights use the social institution of the family to express anxieties about industrialization, urbanization, and the Other? What models for (or warnings about) family life do these novels produce? And what possibilities do visual media such as film or stage performance offer to artists representing or
reimagining the social conventions of the family?  We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.Required TextsMary Shelley, Frankenstein

University requirements mandate that every student in an R1B course produce at least one diagnostic paper and two longer essays (with drafts), for a total of 32 pages of writing.  However, we are not going to launch straight into a 32-page writing assignment. This course will use a combination of writing workshops, reflective homework assignments, class discussion, and group presentations to build up your critical reading and writing skills. In analyzing a series of provocative and difficult texts, we will develop the critical outlook and vocabulary that will be the root of your final project. By the end of this course, you should feel able to present your own research in a well-organized, 10- to 12-page paper.Writing AssignmentsThis semester, we will be working on honing both your analytical and your research skills. There will be four individual papers.  The first is a short sample essay of 2-3 pages. The second is a 6-8 page literary analysis, which will be graded and returned with comments. The third paper will be a revision of your 6-8 page analytical paper.  Substantial revisions are mandatory; you should think of the revision as a fresh paper loosely based on your first draft.  Papers 2 and 3 will each receive their own grades.  These papers will serve as a review of what you learned in R1A and will not include research.The final project for this class will be your research paper.  Your rough draft will be 8 to 10 pages; the final version will be 10 to 12 pages long.  You will choose the text you will research in late October.HomeworkWe will assign homework regularly; assignments will include reading responses and close readings of selected passages from the class’s texts. These assignments will provide an important basis for your papers, and will also help you contribute to class discussion and activities. Periodically, there will be unannounced reading quizzes, so be sure to come thoroughly prepared to each class session.Performance ProjectAs part of our larger discussion of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and Harold Pinter’s “The Lover,” we are going to ask you all to present sections of the texts to the class. In groups, you will choose a portion of one of the plays that you believe is particularly vital to a central theme of that text. You will perform this portion of your selected play. You should then give a close reading of the section you have selected, addressing why it is essential to your interpretation of the play and how it relates formally to the work as a whole. Following your performances, we will collect two-page reflections from each of you on why your group chose this particular scene and what kinds of interpretative decisions you made in presenting it the way that you did.Lateness Policy and ExtensionsPapers must be turned in on time.  Your paper grade will be lowered by 1/3 letter grade (B B-, B- C+, etc.) for each day it is late.  It is your responsibility to balance the requirements of this class with those of your other classes.  That said, extensions will be granted in extreme circumstances with prior consent. Please keep in touch if you are having trouble completing an assignment!  We can discuss arrangements to accept late work if you let us know before the paper is due that you need more time.Attendance and ParticipationAttendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes; roll will be taken every day during this period of both regular and waitlisted students.  Anyone who does not attend all classes during the first two weeks will be dropped from the class.  During the second week of classes, students will be added from the waitlist, and no students may be added after the second week of the term without permission from the Department. Over the course of the semester, you are granted 2 unexcused absences without penalty; all other absences required advance notice and adequate excuse. 2 late arrivals to class (that is, 2 arrivals after 9:45) will also constitute an unexcused absence. Your grade will automatically be lowered 1% for each additional unexcused absence.Participation is a vital part of this course; while there will be occasional lectures and presentations, your active participation is a key component to the success of the class! Please come to class prepared to share observations and questions on the texts we encounter.PlagiarismThe University has a strict policy on Plagiarism:“Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example: Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without

Karina PalauFound poems, quilts, and sculptures made out of trash. Narratives preoccupied with how to recover and retell a lost story.  Museum installations that assemble and remake remnants of a past. Anthropologists obsessed with documenting threatened cultures before they presumably disappear. What do these imply about questions of rescue, recovery, and reuse? What happens when we ‘salvage’ something—an object, a history, a culture—and what does this practice imply?These are just some of the questions we will explore in this course alongside our intensive work on writing.

Taylor Johnston & Yael SegalovitzWhat does it mean to think of performance as narrative? How can we read a spectacle as though it were literature? In this course, we will explore how narrative inhabits dance, oral traditions, audio forms, and theatrical performance from antiquity to the present. Along the way, we will encounter performances that are adaptations of literary texts and ask if these can function as an interpretive tool or a form of criticism. Our reading (and spectating) will help us interrogate the instrumental role performance plays as a mediator between a text and its public, and contemplate the spectator as both reader and literary critic.As part of this course, we will have the exciting opportunity to attend five Cal Performances events (tickets will be complimentary):Mark Morris Dance Group with The Bad Plus (dance)
Sasha Waltz, Impromptus to music by Franz Schubert (dance)
Théâtre de la Ville, Six Characters in Search of an Author (play)
David Sedaris (“Berkeley Talks” series) (lecture)
Robert Wilson, The Old Woman (play)Our discussions will consider these performances in dialogue with texts selected from the following:Homer, The Odyssey (selections)
Daniil Kharms, The Old Woman
Mark Morris, Dido and Aeneas (film of the performance)
Luigi Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author
David Sedaris, Let’s Explore Diabetes with Owls
Virgil, The Aeneid (selections)
Selected recordings from Poets.org, Radiolab, and This American LifeIn addition to these assignments, students will have in class Q&A sessions with next year’s artists in residence (to be announced) and perform some of their own work with teaching artist Rica Anderson. Compositions will incorporate their experiences of reading, spectating, and performing, and develop students’ capacity to produce writing that effectively analyzes a variety of media.  We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Philip Gerard       – Maurizio Lazzarato, The Making of Indebted ManDebt is a way of life. In California, 50% of college seniors who graduated from non-profit institutions last year left school with some form of student debt. From this pool, the average obligation comes out to $20,250. As any 19th century novelist could tell you, this is an auspicious way to begin a story.In this Reading and Composition course we will pursue the topic of debt beyond the bounds of economics. From social obligations to moral duty, from financial lending to literary borrowing, we will examine the meaning(s) and genesis of debt as a concept and a metaphor. As we go over our own set of books, drawing on a series of artistic, anthropological and philosophical treatments of debt from a range of historical periods, we will refine our critical reading skills and study the art of making and defending an argument.As we explore the sorts of obligations that bind us, we will also be studying the craft of writing and revising an analytical paper.  Students can expect to write and revise two papers, give an in-class presentation, and complete several smaller assignments.Books We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Celine Piser & Adeline Tran In this course, we will investigate the question of narrative reliability and whether an objective, “reliable” representation of reality is really possible. We will look at the complexities of narration in fiction and film by first asking how we define the nature of truth and reality. Is truth an objective viewpoint on our world or a set of subjective interpretations? What role does lying play in society, and how would the perspective of a biased or deceptive narrator problematize our interpretation of a text or film? How do issues of perspective affect our perception of truth and reality? We will examine how individual points of view shape the way we think, and we will be interested in how the themes of reliability and unreliability in art can help us learn about our own development as writers of essays.This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, one short diagnostic essay and two longer analytical research papers. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Dollar, dollar bill y’all
—Wu-Tang Clan, “C.R.E.A.M.” (1993)In this course we will examine narratives (plays, life writing, novels, films) that grapple with the idea that cash rules everything. While all of the texts that we will read and view express some degree of anxiety over this idea—whether explicitly (through themes of usury, corruption, the commodification of humans) or implicitly (a monster from the deep, devilish magic)—they are not necessarily working against capitalism. For if narrative fiction has often served as a signal site for exploring the contradictions generated during moments of socioeconomic transition, it also helps naturalize and normalize these contradictions. We will therefore consider the specificity of each text while remaining attentive to common formal elements and practices of representing questions of value and exchange in various cultural, historical, and geographical contexts. Along the way we will ask ourselves: to what extent does storytelling itself become implicated in both the fantasies and crises of capitalism?In order to ground our discussion in particular historical realities, we will focus on texts produced during four chronological periods in four world areas: Renaissance England (late sixteenth century), the transatlantic slave trade (late eighteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries), late colonial and post-independence West Africa (mid-twentieth to twenty-first centuries), and neoliberal South and East Asia (twenty-first century). We will supplement our thinking by reading critical essays from theorists such as David Hawkes, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Saidiya Hartman, Karl Marx, Achille Mbembe, and David Harvey, among others.As part of the university’s Reading and Composition sequence (R1A and R1B), this course is designed to help students develop critical thinking, writing, and oral expression skills that are broadly applicable. Through the study of literary texts, students will learn how to develop interesting analytical arguments, incorporate research in their writing, and refine their ideas through their drafting and revision of several essays. In addition to the essay assignments, students can expect to write short weekly bCourses posts and to contribute to one in-class group presentation. Finally, this is a discussion-based course, so strong emphasis will be placed on active student participation in our class meetings.Possible texts include:Renaissance England
Christopher Marlowe, Doctor Faustus (c. 1592)
William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice (c. 1596)
The Transatlantic Slave Trade
Olaudah Equiano, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789)
Claire de Duras, Ourika (1823)

Caitlin SchollThis course explores the relationship between the plotting of narratives and the plotting of conspiracies. We will read and view texts from a wide range of time periods, world regions, and genres—from Greek tragedy to French Harlequin comedy to Japanese whodunit to Congolese dystopian novel—paying attention to the ways in which the intrigue in the storylines thematizes not only the construction of the narratives themselves, but also the acts of reading and interpretation. What is the relationship between writers and the conspirators that they write about?  Between readers and the detectives (broadly defined) that they read about? What happens when these relationships break down? In our discussions we will consider the political and aesthetic implications of different kinds of plot logic. What does it mean for the truth to be revealed—or not revealed, as the case may be? And why do so many of the plots that we will be studying revolve around dysfunctional marriages and disturbing sexual relationships? We will supplement our thinking about all of these questions by reading critical essays from theorists such as Peter Brooks (whose Reading for the Plot is the source of our course title), Roland Barthes, J. Hillis Miller, and Tzvetan Todorov.The aim of R1A and R1B is to improve the student’s ability to write clearly, effectively, and accurately about subjects of intellectual complexity on the assumption that such writing—and the kinds of thinking that make such writing possible—is both a practical necessity for college students and a significant step in the life of the mind generally. This, therefore, is a writing-intensive course. Students will learn how to develop interesting arguments about the texts that we are studying, incorporate research in their writing, and refine their ideas through their drafting and revision of several essays. As this is a course on plotting, we will focus in particular on how to incorporate intrigue and narrative in the development of analytical arguments.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Irina Popescu and Ma’ayan SelaThis class will explore how many literary and artistic genres create versions of the human, from Ancient Greece to today. As such the texts we will be exploring serve as instances of humanitarian/humane literature and art, which seek to shed light on burgeoning “human” rights ideas throughout the centuries. What are human rights? How did this concept begin and where? How does literature create “humane” texts? How can literature engage with human rights as a discourse and a practice? How does literature provide a critique for human rights as we see them today? In this course we will be reading/viewing texts that deal with the issue of human rights through a variety of genres and media: novels, plays, poems, songs, photographs, and films. Our focus will be the 20th century, but we will also delve into earlier periods in order to create a foundation for our 20th century texts. The texts we read will come from several geographical regions and historical periods, and one of our tasks will be to critically evaluate distinct, sometimes problematic articulations of human rights as we begin to formulate a more global definition and understanding of them. In addition to literary texts, then, we will also read theoretical essays by scholars from Aristotle to Lynn Hunt to help us understand how literature contributes to the human rights discussion and vice versa.Students will be expected to contribute weekly blog entries or assignments, participate actively in class discussion, and write and rewrite academic papers. In addition to the reading we will spend time developing critical reading skills, peer editing, and learning how to frame analytical arguments and use research materials.Texts may include:Kiss of the Spiderwoman by Manuel PuigDeath and the Maiden by Ariel DorfmanDisgrace by J.M. CoezteeThe Trial by Franz KafkaA course reader will be made available to the students which will include many theoretical articles, short stories, poems, and other pertinent material such as style guides and writing worksheets. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

A glance into the literature of any period or place bears witness to the complexity of this relationship.  Across continents and centuries, writers have depicted nature contradictorily: as a space inspiring fear and respect yet also as a space providing succor and comfort; as force to be restrained and dominated or instead as a force to be accepted and embraced; as a presence from which we should distance ourselves (in ways both existential and visceral) or, conversely, as a presence with which we should connect (in ways equally existential and visceral).  This course, by engaging with a variety of genres and art forms, will explore some of the many ways that diverse cultures and time periods have represented and related to nature.  We will discuss themes such as Farming and Land Management; Shifting Perspectives; Labor and the Pastoral; Escapism, Solitude and Solipsism; and Anarchy, Activism and Sustainability. Authors and works for this course include: Elbow, Peter: Writing Without Teachers
 Plato: Critias
 Cortazár, Julio: “La Isla al mediodia”
 Virgil: Georgics
 Leopardi, Giacomo: Little Moral Works (in selection)
 Shakespeare, William: The Winter’s Tale
 Wordsworth, William and Samuel Coleridge: Lyrical Ballads (in selection)
 Clare, John: “A Lamentation for Round Oak Waters”
 Tolstoy, Leo: The Cossacks
 Dillard, Annie: “Heaven and Earth in Jest” and “Living Like Weasels”
 Abbey, Edward: Desert Solitaire (in selection)
 Neruda, Pablo: Odes (in selection)
 Fincher, David: Fight Club
 Reynolds, Michael: Garbage Warrior
This is a reading and writing intensive course with several essay assignments which will build upon the skills acquired in R1A. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying while entering the world of literary criticism and learning to integrate and interrogate criticism in their own writing. This course satisfies the University requirement for the R1B Reading and Composition class.

																	Comparative Literature R1B: “Fifty Shades” of Desire
Section 8 Paul De Morais (pdemorais@berkeley.edu) Fall 2015
Office Hours: Fridays 11 AM – 1 PM,  TBA Dwinelle Hall“The world is little, people are little, human life is little.  There is only one big thing—desire.”—Willa Cather, The Song of the Lark“Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the
tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.”—Roland Barthes, A Lover’s DiscourseDesire manifests in different forms: the desire for a commodity, the desire for status, the desire for love, the desire for sex, etc. While some desires easily find social approval and validation, others appear forbidden and taboo. We all desire, but how often do we critically reflect upon our own desires? What kinds of knowledge about the world or ourselves do our desires enable us to obtain, and what kinds of ethical problems do we confront as desiring beings subject to various passions? In this course we will answer these and other questions as we explore the significance of desire through our careful reading of various novels, poems, and philosophical texts that deal with different forms of desire. We will analyze how the social, the somatic, and the psychological intersect in the production and repression of desires. Along the way we will also explore how desire affects the very structure of a literary work and the significance of desire for linguistic expression. Our range of texts, spanning from ancient Greece to 1970s France, will allow us to observe the manifestation and significance of desire in various historical and sociocultural contexts, and we will examine the ways in which desire is pertinent to discourses of gender, sexuality, race, and class.This course is designed to help students develop critical thinking, writing, and oral expression skills that are applicable beyond the domain of literary studies. Students will learn how to develop interesting analytical arguments, incorporate research into their

Attendance, Participation, & Preparation: 15%—————————————————Course Policies:Writing: One of the primary objectives of this course is to show how better reading makes for better writing. Writing workshops will help acquaint you with the ins and outs of college-level writing, and reading assignments and in-class discussions will give you
something about which to write. You will learn what an argument is, what can be argued, and how to argue it, as well as how to use introductions, conclusions, evidence, and even punctuation to your utmost advantage. You will also learn how to incorporate
secondary sources such as criticism and other scholarly work into your writing. The course requires at least 32 pages of writing on your part. First drafts will be assigned a provisional grade to indicate the grade that the draft would have received had it been a final draft. As one objective of this course is to practice revision, first drafts must be complete papers. Failure to submit a complete first draft will result in a lowered grade for the final draft. (See “Late Papers & Assignments” for further details.)All essays must be typed and double-spaced with one-inch margins. In addition to the essays, you will complete several shorter writing assignments throughout the course, both in class and at home. These include the required bCourses posts, which are to be posted by midnight on the night before class. Exploratory essay assignments are designed to help you begin thinking about the content of your midterm and final essays. A good exploratory essay consists of a 3-4 page focused analysis that unfolds the complexity of a particular issue within a primary text and concludes with a tentative thesis. An inability to respond to the text in these writing assignments will be reflected in your grade.All papers must be accompanied by a works cited page that includes your primary source(s) and any secondary sources that have contributed to your paper. The works cited page and in-text citations should be in an accepted format (MLA or Chicago). Please remember that the works cited section does not count towards the total number of required pages. Papers and bibliographies are due electronically via e-mail on their assigned due dates.Late Papers & Assignments: Written assignments must be submitted on time. For every calendar day that an assignment is late, its final letter grade will receive one-third of a deduction. These deductions are cumulative: if your first draft and final draft are late by a day each, two-thirds of a letter grade will be deducted from the final grade for that assignment. Notify me in class or by email if an assignment will be submitted late. I am willing to discuss extensions in the case of extenuating circumstances, but I cannot guarantee an extension. If you wish to request an extension, see me after class, come to my office, or email me, preferably at the earliest possible moment. Incomplete drafts will be considered late papers, and deductions will accumulate until you submit a complete draft. Short in-class writing assignments and bCourses posts may not be made up and will not be accepted late.Participation: This is a discussion- and workshop-driven course. It is not a lecture course. We must all come to class having completed the assigned reading and prepared to participate actively in discussion and activities. Forms of participation include
responding to questions posed by the instructor or other students, posing questions for the class to consider, proposing passages for discussion, and volunteering to read aloud.  Pop quizzes may be given if there is an overall decline in participation. Group work and in-class peer review assignments also count toward your participation grade. We also ask that every student help foster an environment that makes full class participation possible. Friendly debates can be very productive, but everyone’s contribution deserves respect and consideration. Disrespect and hostility will not be tolerated.Attendance: Attendance will be taken every day in class. If you are not going to be in class, notify me by email to excuse the absence. Members of any groups that require school-related absences (athletes, musicians, etc.) should discuss their schedules with me by the end of the second week of class.Please note that only two absences may be excused. More than two excused absences, and any unexcused absences, will negatively impact your grade. Three late arrivals will equal one unexcused absence. If you are going to be consistently late (perhaps because
you have a class on the other side of campus), let me know by the end of the second week of class. Arriving more than twenty minutes late or leaving more than twenty minutes early will count as an absence unless you notify me beforehand. Five unexcused absences will put you in danger of failing the course.
Attendance is MANDATORY for the first two weeks of classes. Any student who does not attend all classes during this time period will likely be dropped from the class. After the first two weeks, students will be added from the waitlist. You must be on the
waitlist to be added to the class, and no student can be added after the end of the second week without permission from the department.Technology: In order to minimize distractions, laptop computers or any other kind of electronic devices (i-Pads, etc) are not permitted in the classroom. (Students who require a laptop for documented reasons are exempt from this prohibition, provided
that they supply me with proper documentation.) You will want to invest in a notebook and a pen or pencil for note taking.Office Hours: For help with papers, assignments, reading, or any other concerns, come see me during my regular office hours at  Dwinelle Hall, or schedule an appointment if you have a time conflict. Requests for an appointment should be sent in
advance, not the day before you desire to meet. Please arrive on the dot (not Berkeley time) for your appointment.Additional Help: Students may and are encouraged to consult the Student Learning Center for tutoring sessions. Ongoing tutoring sessions must be requested during the first two weeks of the semester; after the first two weeks, sessions are available by
appointment only. You can refer to the SLC’s website for further information: http://slc.berkeley.edu/general/index.htmStudents may also seek writing tutoring through the comparative literature student-tutoring program. See me for more information.Students with Disabilities: Please see me if you require special accommodations, either privately after class or in my office. The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for verifying that students have disability-related needs and
for planning appropriate accommodations in cooperation with the students themselves and student instructors. Students who need special arrangements (such as for evacuation) should request them from DSP: 230 César Chávez Student Center, 510-642-
0518 (voice) & 510-642-6376 (TTY), http://dsp.berkeley.edu/Academic Honesty: Assignments must be new material written specifically for this course. Recycling assignments from other courses is considered a form of cheating and will be treated accordingly.On Plagiarism:“Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example:• Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without acknowledgment.• Use of the views, opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment.• Paraphrasing of another person’s characteristic or original phraseology, metaphor or other literary device without acknowledgment.”(From the Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct from the Office of Student Conduct, http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp?id=1143&rcol=1201. Emphasis mine.)If you are at all confused about what constitutes plagiarism, please ask us.  “Accidental” plagiarism is still plagiarism and will be treated as such. If you are caught plagiarizing, you will receive an F for the work in question and may be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.Reading and Assignment Schedule:Date Reading Assignment Assignment Due Date

Kathryn Crim & Carli CutchinA glimpse, a whiff, a graze, a chill. This course explores how literature, and its critics, both approach and retreat from an account of sense experience. When and how does description invoke the body? Why do certain senses—sight and sound—so often mediate representations of the other, “lower” senses—smell, touch, and taste? Alongside excerpts from discussions of the senses in Aristotle, Plato, and Merleau-Ponty, we’ll begin the semester by reading poems—from the early modern period to German modernism—which call up and call upon sense understanding. Then we’ll turn to novels and plays that both inspire our sensual imagination and, at the same time, seem to warn against the hazards of trusting too much to feeling.All along we’ll ask how a sense vocabulary figures the way in which we talk about such texts. Does “point-of-view” have anything to do with the way in which we actuallysee? Poetic “voice” with how we hear? What do we mean when we talk of having good and bad “taste”? To ask these questions we’ll supplement our readings with painting, music, and film. And toward the end of the semester we’ll consider how literature itself becomes a supplement in the absence or deprivation of sense faculties. Finally, we’ll ask after that most fleeting of senses, the sixth: Given poetry’s ancient reputation as prophecy is the most “literary” of senses a premonition of ghosts?Our investigation will be shaped by practice: the course’s emphasis is on reading and rereading, writing and re-writing. Thus assignments will be aimed at developing students’ powers of description, persuasion, and argumentation. They will include one critical analysis and a longer research paper, a mid-term presentation, and numerous short writing assignments.Possible texts to include:“The Unknown Masterpiece” by Honoré de Balzac
“The Purloined Letter” by Edgar Allen Poe
“The Kiss” by Anton Chekhov
The Winter’s Tale by William Shakespeare

Kathryn CrimThis above all: to thine own self be true
And it doth follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
—Polonius, HamletThis course will investigate how we read, register, expect or, alternately, disdain a sense of sincerity in literature.  What does it mean to really mean it? Is sincerity a performance or is it, rather, the absence of performance?  Can such honesty be a virtue or a vice? The course texts will demand we attend to style and address across genres—from sonnets and political speeches, to early modern drama, to the epistolary novel and the short story. As we turn from Shakespeare and Molière to Kafka and Clarice Lispector, we’ll also ask about the relationship between sincerity and irony. How is intimacy constructed? How is social faith critiqued? What is the difference between a public forum and a private exchange? And how do the texts we call “literary” trouble the difference?This investigation will be shaped by practice: the course’s emphasis is on reading and rereading, writing and re-writing. Thus assignments will be aimed at developing students’ powers of description, persuasion, and argumentation. Assignments will include one critical analysis and a longer research paper, a mid-term project, and several short writing assignments.Major texts:
Hamlet by William Shakespeare
The Misanthrope by Molière
The Sorrows of Young Werther by Johann W. Goethe
The Immoralist by André Gide

Adeline TranIn this course, we will investigate the question of narrative reliability and whether an objective, ‘reliable’ representation of reality is really possible.  We will look at the complexities of narration in fiction and film by first asking how we define the nature of truth and reality.  Is truth an objective viewpoint on our world or a set of subjective interpretations?  What role does ‘lying’ play in society, and how would the perspective of a biased or deceptive narrator problematize our interpretation of a text or film?  How do issues of perspective affect our perception of truth and reality?  We will examine how individual points of view shape the way we think, and we will be interested in how the themes of reliability and unreliability in art can help us learn about our own development as writers of essays.  This class includes two formal papers and places strong emphasis on active student participation.Texts:

Karina PalauWhat does it mean to see? What is implied when we talk about seeing something differently, seeing for the first time, or making an experience, a person, or a place visible? How do visual media like photography or spaces like museums ‘train’ our eyes and shape how we think about seeing as a physical, social, and political activity? What are different ways that we practice seeing, and how do these interact with what we consider accessible, knowable, or even relevant?These are just some of the many questions that we will explore together this semester while engaging a range of materials from museum exhibits to photographs, historical documents to narratives. Alongside our critical inquiry into practices of seeing, we will practice our writing skills; this course fulfills the second half of the University Reading & Composition (R&C) requirement, and we will dedicate ample time to critical thinking and essay-writing skills, paying special attention to argumentation, analysis, and the basics of how to put together a strong and convincing academic paper.Texts and Materials:“Everyday Use,” Alice Walker

J. Crewe & E. LaskinTales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.Texts May Include: The Odyssey (selections), Homer

South and North America share a similar history of conquest, slavery, nation-building, and migration. The works and authors we will read in this course help us think about the ways this history is transmitted, codified and remembered. They ask us, as readers of these texts, to reexamine the history we think we know. Storytelling in the Americas thus acts as a means of rewriting history, thereby opening up the spaces for previously unheard voices to appear and exist.This course will revolve around the following questions:These are just some of the questions we will be pursuing in this class as we explore these two continents. This course will be very poetry-heavy, but we will also read three novels, a slave narrative, a testimony, and several theoretical articles which should help us create a foundation upon which we can discuss the connection between literature, human rights, memory and history. Students will be expected to contribute weekly blog entries on b-space, participate in class discussion, give one group presentation, and write several short responses, a diagnostic essay, one 6-8 page paper, and a final paper 8-10 page paper. In addition to the reading we will spend time revising, learning how to frame analytical arguments and use research material, peer-editing, and developing critical reading skills.Texts:The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot DíazThe Little School by Alicia PortnoyKingdom of this World by Alejo CarpentierNarrative of Frederick Douglass by Frederick DouglassCrossing by Manuel Luis Martinez
We will also be watching two films as a class, to be determined by the students from a list provided by the instructor.

Johnathan Vaknin & Howard FisherIn this course, we will look at the ways in which law and literature converge, diverge, and inform one another directly or indirectly. From Sophocles’s Antigone to Melville’s Billy Budd, and from Kafka’s The Trial to Puig’s Kiss of the Spider Woman, our readings will be guided by the following questions, among others: How might we think of social norms both in terms of culture and the law, and what is the function of each in the construction of these norms? How do certain texts represent positions outside of the law? Is there an “outside” to the law? What shared formal and stylistic elements might we identify between legal texts and cultural texts? (Think, for example, of the importance of testimony and narration). While most of our readings will be literary, in the final segment of the semester we will shift our attention to films as well as to specific legal documents.The second in the University’s two-part R&C sequence, this class is meant, above all, to help students improve their critical writing, reading, and research skills. In addition to regular attendance and participation, requirements include a series of essays—drafts and revisions—and short responses.Possible texts include:Franz Kafka, The Trial
Herman Melville, Billy Budd
Manuel Puig, Kiss of the Spider Woman
Sophocles, Antigone
Albert Camus, The Stranger
Gabriel García Márquez, Chronicle of a Death Foretold

Professor Gretchen HeadThis course will begin with the textual foundations of the Islamic tradition to understand why some books are read as dangerously subversive in particular historical moments. With a focus on contestations of both religious orthodoxy and reigning paradigms of normative gender and sexuality, we will look at examples of poetry and prose that have offered discursive challenges to the norms upheld by their respective societies. We will ask, for example, why a novel like Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, was immediately interpreted as heretical, resulting in the most notorious literary controversy of the twentieth century and numerous attempts on the author’s life, even though many aspects of the text would have been far less objectionable centuries earlier. We will examine the evolution of accepted representations of desire, both as they have changed from within the Arabic tradition and how these changes have
sometimes been imposed from the outside by Western cultural practices.
Readings will include excerpts from the Qur’an, poetry by Abu Nuwas, excerpts from the 1001 Nights, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alaa al-Aswany, Naguib Mahfuz, Mohamed Choukri, Michel Foucault, Joseph Masad and Rachid al-Daif.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

S. Schneider & O. ErezHow would our lives change if we lived in a two-dimensional universe? If we could travel freely, without subjection to borders, but had no one place to call home? How can a whole city be invisible? This course will encourage building critical reading, thinking and writing skills around literary works and theoretical essays, and films that consider space as a primary concern. These texts explore the invisible or unspoken laws governing even the most familiar places. Some of our texts ask how real or imaginative spaces reflect the encounters, experiences and memories of an individual. In others, space itself becomes the protagonist or antagonist. We will use our critical analyses to question how geographical, architectural and fictional spaces are manipulated or in turn manipulate us.Writing shares much with space-building: whether they be in a room, a city street, a border crossing or outer space, imaginative narratives are inextricable from their environments. Similarly, critical arguments also require a considered framework for their composition. By engaging with works of literature, film and photography that make clear allusions, through their depiction of space, to their mode and style of composition, we will consider the way we compose. Through readings and class discussions, we will focus on how to frame our narratives and arguments to get our audience on the same page with us.As this is a writing intensive course, many of our activities will be dedicated towards refining your prose. Assignments include a diagnostic paper, a 6-7 page analytical paper and a 10-page research paper. The two larger papers will include a draft and the final paper, and we will place a major emphasis on the process of revision. Other assignments include approximately bi-weekly bSpace postings, group presentations, a final, independent presentation and in-class writing exercises.Texts and films may include:Edwin A. Abbott Flatland

																	How would our lives change if we lived in a two-dimensional universe? If we could travel freely, without subjection to borders, but had no one place to call home? How can a whole city be invisible? This course will encourage building critical reading, thinking and writing skills around literary works and theoretical essays, and films that consider space as a primary concern. These texts explore the invisible or unspoken laws governing even the most familiar places. Some of our texts ask how real or imaginative spaces reflect the encounters, experiences and memories of an individual. In others, space itself becomes the protagonist or antagonist. We will use our critical analyses to question how geographical, architectural and fictional spaces are manipulated or in turn manipulate us.Writing shares much with space-building: whether they be in a room, a city street, a border crossing or outer space, imaginative narratives are inextricable from their environments. Similarly, critical arguments also require a considered framework for their composition. By engaging with works of literature, film and photography that make clear allusions, through their depiction of space, to their mode and style of composition, we will consider the way we compose. Through readings and class discussions, we will focus on how to frame our narratives and arguments to get our audience on the same page with us.Course Requirements:As this is a writing intensive course, many of our activities will be dedicated towards refining your prose. Assignments include a diagnostic paper, a 6-7 page analytical paper and a 10-page research paper. The two larger papers will include a draft and the final paper, and we will place a major emphasis on the process of revision. Other assignments include approximately bi-weekly bSpace postings, group presentations, a final, independent presentation and in-class writing exercises.Texts and films may include:Edwin A.

																	Comparative Literature R1B: 10 STUDY ABROADTu/Th 12:30-2pm  Diana Thow & Ma’ayan Sela79 Dwinelle“Study Abroad” is a current staple of the US college experience, one that requires applications, letters of recommendation, and approved programs of study. But the idea of traveling to study in a foreign country has long been crucial to the formation and education of students across time and cultural contexts. In this class we will think about the way that literature and film explore the experience of this course of study, and together we will investigate some of the issues, problems, and pleasures that arise from studying abroad. Some of the questions that will shape our semester include:  How does identity become defined or suppressed in relation to a new cultural and linguistic experience?  What is the “intellectual preparation” of study that is enriched by this experience, (to borrow the words of the Berkeley Study Abroad Mission statement)?  What is the relation between studying abroad, privilege, and class? We will also think about how the experience of coming to the US to pursue an education is represented in literature and film, as well as the experience of Americans abroad.  As a class, we will try to trace how the concept of studying abroad changes significantly depending on its cultural, historical, and literary context, and think critically about our own ideas and assumptions about what it means to study abroad within this range of contexts.This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on critical thinking and the process of revision.  Students will be asked to complete short writing assignments as well as formal analytical essays and one research presentation.Required books (available at the bookstore for purchase)

A Required Course Reader *will also be available with shorter works (poems, short stories and essays) by: Ta-Nehisi Coates,  Goethe, Ben Lerner, James Baldwin, Ernest Hemingway, Joachim Du Bellay, Chinelo Okparanta, and Arthur Rimbaud.*our course reader with writing workshop materials, additional excerpts, and critical material will be available for purchase at Replica Copy, 2138 Oxford St., after our first class meeting.  All other handouts will be made available in class or on the class bcourses site.Course objectives:This is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper.  We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper.Writing Assignments:This R1B, like all Reading and Composition courses, was designed to help strengthen your critical reading and writing skills.  The efforts made over the course of the semester will be with you for the rest of your college career (and beyond!), so a high amount of dedication and involvement is expected. The core of the course is structured around two written assignments, both different in length.  Each paper will help hone a variety of critical skills, including questions of argumentation, organization, and close reading.  You will be graded on your first version of the first paper, and then again on an extensively revised and extended version of the paper.Your third (final) paper will be graded once. Papers must be turned in on time at the beginning of class. Late papers will be penalized by 1/3 letter grade (A to A-, A- to B+) for each day they are late. If the paper is handed in late on the due date
without prior notice or if it is delivered in a different format than requested (ie via email rather than hardcopy), the paper may be penalized 1/3 of a letter grade. Extensions will be granted for extenuating circumstances with prior consent; if you think you need an extension you will need to receive permission from me at least 48 hours before the due date in the case of a first draft or
other written assignment.  Please inform me a minimum of one week in advance of the paper due date in the case of a final draft.  Please double-space your papers, using one-inch margins and Times New Roman font in 12-point size, and include a word count in your header.Writing Workshops and Close reading papers will be due regularly throughout the semester; the lowest of these paper
grades will be dropped before we calculate your final grade.  We have also included a number of writing exercises in the reader that will help guide you through the writing and revision process. We will take time in class to go over the fundamentals of writing a successful analytical paper.  These writing workshops are an opportunity for you to ask questions, brainstorm with your
classmates, and practice at home, so please consider the exercises a vital part of the course. Please note: We do not accept late homework assignments.  These include writing workshops, and other writing assignments.  If you do not hand those in on the date requested you will not receive credit for them.Class ParticipationSince this is a small discussion-based class, participation is a large percentage of your final grade (20%). Your participation grade is not just calculated based on your regular attendance: it also depends heavily on your contribution to group discussion, collaborative readings, and peer edits.   That being said, if you are shy or have a hard time participating in class, there are many ways to demonstrate your engagement with the course materials.  Coming regularly to my office hours is one way to do this, we’re always happy to talk about things we’ve covered in class in more detail.  We expect each student to come to class prepared, with text in hand.  Get into the habit of annotating and using post-its to mark important passages that appear interesting or strange to
you.  Before class, think of a few questions or ideas that you want to bring to the table and write them down in the margin.  You should consider class as a free space to pose questions, raise literary hypotheses, or respond to another’s ideas.  Cell phones, laptops and ipads are not allowed in the classroom, unless you need special accommodation.  If you need a special accommodation please let me know within the first 2 weeks of school.AttendanceAttendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes. Roll will be taken every day during this period of both regular and waitlisted students.  Anyone who does not attend all classes during the first two weeks may be dropped from the class.  At the end of the first and second week of classes, students will be added manually from the waitlist.  If you are attempting to add into this class and did not attend the first day, you will be expected to attend all class meetings thereafter and, if space permits, you will be allowed to enroll.  No students will be added after end of the second week of the term without permission from the Department.  Students can only be added from the wait-list.WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY YOUR EFFORTS AND SUCCESS IN ARRIVING PROMPTLY (ON BERKELEY TIME) EACH DAY. Let us know by email if you know that you will be absent.  (Athletes and musicians should provide, sometime during the first two weeks, a written schedule showing conflicts between athletic/musical events and class time.) When absent, please check with another student to find out what you have missed and whether there are assignments or announcements.  AFTER 2 UNEXCUSED ABSENCES, ALL ABSENCES WILL COUNT TOWARDS YOUR ATTENDANCE/PARTICIPATION GRADE.  MORE THAN 7 UNEXCUSED ABSENCES (E.G. WITHOUT NOTE FROM A DOCTOR, COACH, OR ACADEMIC DEAN) WILL MAKE FOR A
FAILING GRADE IN THE CLASS.

Mandy CohenWhat if the Cold War became hot? What if John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry had succeeded?  What if the bomb under Hitler’s desk hadn’t missed? “What if” is the question that jump starts the imagination of children and scientists, writers and science fiction nerds, oppressed peoples and activists—everyone who thinks about making a different world possible. Science Fiction in general has sometimes been called “the literature of change”: take the world you know, imagine a possibly possible change, and chart the way from here to there. This course will zoom in on the hybrid child of science fiction and history: Alternate History. Alternate histories are science fiction that can take place in the past, the present or future, if only something in the “real world” had gone a little differently. We’ll look at examples from the hey-day of SF in 20th century US literature, but we’ll also explore older historical works and works from other literatures which ask the same question, “what if?”  Rather than escaping through a wormhole in search of sexy green aliens, we’ll investigate works in which “the literature of change” is concerned with this world: why are things the way they are? What’s gone wrong? And what are the political alternatives that might not be so fantastic, if we could only see the way from here to there?The major goal of this course is to develop and practice critical reading and writing skills for a broad range of analytical and research writing, with the alternate histories serving as rich, stimulating and hopefully fun material for our writing. Through workshops, revisions, and collaborative work we’ll improve our ability to read a text analytically, create interesting and meaningful arguments, and support those arguments through research. In addition to the works of fiction, we’ll read literary and historical essays both as writing models and to engage our readings with their ideas.Texts for the course will be:Octavia Butler. Kindred
Alan Moore. Watchmen
Terry Bisson. Fire on the Mountain
Kurt Vonnegut. Slaughterhouse 5
Jorge Luis Borges. “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,” “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,”

Kathryn Crim          Once a thing is put in writing, the composition, whatever it may be, drifts all over the place.                                                                                                —Plato’s Phaedrus Broadly defined, the term “ekphrasis” (ek – out, phrasis – to speak) is description: It once indicated, in the art of ancient rhetoric, “an expository speech vividly bringing the subject before our eyes.”  In literary studies, the term has come to denote a poetic mode of “giving voice” to a visual representation. This course will follow a long history of both “speaking out” an aesthetic experience and speaking for a mute object.  We’ll begin by reading a lot poetry and a few philosophical texts, look at a number of paintings and photographs, and turn to dramatic, fictional, and filmic works that all make use of ekphrasis. How does a descriptive mode constitute an encounter between two mediums, between a self and an other? Can this encounter ever overcome or can it only articulate the distance between two worlds? Furthermore, what can ekphrastic literature tell us about art and emotion? About emotions and ethics? Toward the end of the semester, we’ll consider how ekphrasis has influenced other disciplines, such as natural science, history, and psychoanalysis.Our inquiry will be shaped by practice: students should expect to spend a lot of time reading and rereading, looking and looking again, and, of course, writing—which is to say, developing their powers of both description and argumentation. Assignments will include one critical analysis and a longer research paper, a mid-term project, and several short writing assignments.Major texts:
Shakespeare, Narrative Poems and A Winter’s Tale
Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayMost of the readings will be collected in a course reader with selections from Homer’s Illiad and Virgil’s Aeneid and poems by John Keats, Percy Shelly, Robert Browning, Andrew Marvell, Charles Baudelaire, Emily Dickinson, Rainer Maria Rilke, W. H. Auden, William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens, Anne Carson, and Seamus Heaney. Theoretical, art historical and scientific writings may include Plato, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, Denis Diderot, G.E. Lessing, John Ruskin, Brentano and Kleist, Sigmund Freud, Barbara Johnson, and Marshall McLuhan.Films:
Chris Marker, Sans Soleil or Statues Also Die

Jessica CreweTales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.Texts May Include:Arthur Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four 
Rudyard Kipling, “The Mark of the Beast”Aphra Behn, Oroonoko
Daniel DeFoe, Robinson Crusoe [excerpts]

Margarita GordonWe tend to view fact and fiction as polar opposites, opposites that shape our concept of knowledge, truth, and morality. Yet when we speak of “actual fact” in contrast to “mere fiction,” we often take for granted or simply ignore the basis for differentiating them from one another. In this course, we will endeavor to define the precepts—cultural, philosophical, and psychological—that govern this distinction.  More radically, we will ask to what extent the distinction holds up, particularly in view of the genres that thwart it: diaries, “true stories,” historical fictions, literary journalism, and so on. What “counts” as fact or fiction and how, even within a given world (or text), might that shift? In a claim to truth, what constitutes evidence or proof? Although we may be used to deliberating over what was said or done, how do we grapple with whether someone or something even exists (or existed)? Does the fact that different texts have different standards for fact and fiction make all truth relative? Or is there such a thing as absolute or objective truth, and if so, what form does it take? How do we, as readers, establish whether an account is reliable? And by what means do fact and fiction each signal, or attempt to summon, the presence of the other?Texts may include:William Shakespeare, Othello
Mikhail Bulgakov, The Master and Margarita
Mary McCarthy, “Artists in Uniform”
Ben Marcus, selections from The Age of Wire and String
Tim O’Brien, selections from The Things They Carried
Leo Tolstoy, Sebastopol Sketches and “A History of Yesterday”

Ashley BrockOnce considered primarily a form of education and/ or propaganda, the documentary film is enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the 21st century as a form of entertainment and art. In an age crazed with reality television and celebrity biographies, the documentary genre throws into relief a number of questions that have long vexed and animated literature, photography, and film: What does it mean to show a life “as it really is”, to tell a story “as it really happened”? How can authenticity be measured and proven, and what responsibility does a storyteller have to do so? What are the ethical demands and ethical pitfalls of telling someone else’s story, and how are these related to the fraught quests for objectivity, authenticity, and fidelity to “the truth”? Where does the line between art and document lie? These are just a few of the questions we will be exploring while examining texts from a wide range of time periods and cultural traditions.In fulfillment of the Reading and Composition requirement, this class aims to improve the students’ abilities to write clearly, effectively, and accurately about subjects of intellectual complexity in order to prepare them for the demands of college-level coursework. This class also emphasizes the inherent value of the critical reading and critical thinking skills that make such writing possible. To these ends, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling argumentative paper.Texts may include:Plato’s Republic (selections)
William Wordsworth’s “Preface” and Lyrical Ballads (selections)
Gustave Flaubert, Selected short fiction
Miguel Barnet’s Biography of a Runaway Slave
Susan Sontag’s Regarding the Pain of Others

ErezHunger is fundamental: both because it is utterly ordinary, shaping the course of our daily life, and also because it is simultaneously one of the most complex and mysterious of yearnings, shaping the murky landscape of our psyche.  It is as mundane as a craving for a ham sandwich and as abstract and often unconscious as a need to feel loved, a need to feel safe, or a need to feel connected to a community.In this course we will explore literature in which characters experience hunger of all sorts but are often uncertain of what exactly they are hungering for.  We’ll discuss Kafka’s “hunger artist,” who, as he performs great feats of starvation for crowds of spectators, feels perpetually misunderstood and lonely and can only think to starve himself for longer and longer periods of time.  We’ll meet a group of terrifying, flesh-eating wolves in Angela Carter’s short story, who never cease, nonetheless, to mourn their irremediable appetites.  We’ll read about the fairy tale witch who fattens up a little boy and girl to gobble them up herself.  And we’ll even meet on film “Hannibal the Cannibal” in the Silence of the Lambs, whose brutality in eating human bodies is matched only by his cultured politeness to the FBI agent whose own unconscious hungers he is keen to point out to her.This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, and research.Reading list:
Franz Kafka, “The Hunger Artist”
Amélie Nothomb, The Life of Hunger (selections)
Angela Carter, “The Company of Wolves”
Shirley Jackson, We Have Always Lived in the Castle
Anne Sexton, Transformations (selected poems)
Nikolai Gogol, “The Overcoat”

Kfir Cohen & Taylor Johnston In this course we will develop writing and argumentative skills through exploring theoretical and imaginative texts whose imaginary worlds attempt to solve some of the perennial problems of modern living. We will think through questions concerning the conditions needed to bring about a just society (Republic), the relation between justice and technological innovation (Minority Report; Akira), how utopian wishes are coded in mass culture (Jameson/Eagleton) among others. We will watch several contemporary films, and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on utopian fiction and sci-fi. The following questions will underlie a few of our conceptual inquires: under what social conditions an “alternative world” becomes desirable? What do we mean by “world” and what might be its opposites? What role do literary form and genre have in constructing an alternative world? What kind of attitude do we adopt vis à vis such texts whose implicit or explicit aim is to be “more” than an imaginary experiment? Books RequiredThomas More, Utopia

L. Wagner & H. FisherWhat does it mean to meet someone or something we can’t name?  How do we know the difference between self and other, between friend and foe, between the familiar and the foreign?  What distinguishes a novel experience from an everyday event?  And how do we talk about what we’ve seen?  This course will turn to a variety of literary genres and visual representations as we interrogate the notion of the encounter.  We’ll track down visits to and from alien worlds, examine meetings between cultures, and look at contact with animals and with ghosts.  Most importantly, we’ll work on developing the critical reading and analytical writing skills that will help us to articulate what happens in our own close encounters with texts of all kinds.Texts will be chosen from among the following:Henry James, The Turn of the Screw
Charles R. Johnson, Middle Passage
Jamaica Kincaid, Lucy
China Miéville, EmbassytownFilms:Werner Herzog, Grizzly ManA course reader will include selections by François Rabelais, Michel de Montaigne, Olaudah Equiano, Elizabeth Bishop, Edgar Allen Poe, Julio Cortázar, and John Berger, as well as varied resources on writing.

Vesna RodicIn this course, we will focus on textual and visual representations of migration and multicultural identities in English, Spanish, and French-speaking contexts. We will read about cultural encounters occurring in various parts of the world, including France, Africa, the United States, and the Caribbean, in order to study key elements of a multicultural identity.  We will explore how language, a geographically determined place and space, attachment to a community (or lack thereof) can inform one’s sense of a multicultural self.  We will also focus on the relationship between the cultures informing one’s identity including one’s native and the adoptive culture, as well as the experience of belonging to multiple communities.The journeys and encounters between cultures that we will read about will be internal as much as external and will involve questions of displacement and belonging, home, travel, stereotypes, cultural assimilation and alienation, exclusion and inclusion, among others. In our study of representations of a multicultural identity, we will embrace, as our method of inquiry, the intersectionality between elements of identity such as gender, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity, and nationality.Required Readings:(a) Primary sources will include:
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance
Gloria Anzaldua, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza
Michel de Montaigne, “Of Cannibals”

J. Raisch & T. JohnstonWhat do we do with information we’re not intended to receive? In this class, we’ll be exploring the concepts of eavesdropping, surveillance, and interception as both plot devices within works of fiction and as effects produced by the act of reading fiction. By looking at works of literature and criticism that depict scenarios of overhearing and prying, we’ll also be considering the issues of privacy, trust, intimacy, and above all, communication. Why, for example, does the epistolary genre pretend to address someone other than the reader? Why do we believe the fiction that reality television allows us to glimpse “the real”? Or, is there some way in which all fiction appeals to us because it is a kind of prying?As a reading and composition class, we’ll use this awareness of audience, and of the complexities of communication more generally, as a foundation for improving analytical and persuasive writing.Texts may include the following:William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing
Bram Stoker’s Dracula
selections from Migeul de Cervantes’ Don Quixote

Laura Wagner & Maya KronfeldFiction is full of characters who exert a pull on their readers: those in whom we see versions of ourselves, those for whom we sense an immediate bond of friendship or feel an intense enmity, those we hate to love or love to hate, and those who remain forever inscrutable no matter how hard we try to get inside their thoughts and feelings.  However, while one of our first instincts as readers may be to respond to such characters in terms of attraction and aversion, as friend or as foe, we’re also told repeatedly that one of the cardinal sins of serious literary engagement is to “identify” with the figures who populate the worlds we read about, who are, after all, mere words on the page.This course proposes to take seriously our reactions to literary characters: rather than simply dismiss our impulse to respond to these fictional figures as real people, we’ll interrogate exactly how and why fictional texts make us respond as we do. We’ll consider figures from ancient epic and medieval allegory, whom modern readers may resist seeing as “true” characters. We’ll encounter protagonists who are themselves prone to over-identify with the fictional worlds they consume in books and who have exerted an undue influence over the lives (and deaths) of their past readers. We’ll meet characters whose charisma exerts a magical pull over us, and others whose thoughts and behavior repel us. We’ll think about what makes a character representative, what differentiates a protagonist from a minor character, a hero from an antihero, and what strategies authors use to represent the complexities of human consciousness.Our investigation will be based in a close reading of the characters we encounter together in our course texts. With these literary works as our common terrain, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading and analytical writing skills, learning to become more careful readers and to advance increasingly complex interpretive arguments about literary texts. Course requirements include active class participation, a diagnostic essay, a midterm paper and final research paper (both of which will be revised), and frequent short analytical and creative writing assignments.Course texts will be chosen from among the following:
The Sorrows of Young Werther, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
What Maisie Knew, Henry James
Lucy, Jamaica Kincaid
Mrs. Dalloway, Virginia WoolfScreenings:
The Sopranos (Season1, selected episodes), David ChaseA course reader will contain selections from among the following: Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, Flaubert’s “A Simple Heart,” Wallace’s “The Depressed Person,”excerpts from Homer’s Iliad, Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, Cervantes’s Don Quixote,Proust’s Swann’s Way, Kafka’s “The Judgment,” excerpts from critical texts including Aspects of the Novel by E.M.

Professor Gretchen HeadThis course will begin with the textual foundations of the Islamic tradition to understand why some books are read as dangerously subversive in particular historical moments. With a focus on contestations of both religious orthodoxy and reigning paradigms of normative gender and sexuality, we will look at examples of poetry and prose that have offered discursive challenges to the norms upheld by their respective societies. We will ask, for example, why a novel like Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, was immediately interpreted as heretical, resulting in the most notorious literary controversy of the twentieth century and numerous attempts on the author’s life, even though many aspects of the text would have been far less objectionable centuries earlier. We will examine the evolution of accepted representations of desire, both as they have changed from within the Arabic tradition and how these changes have sometimes been imposed from the outside by Western cultural practices.
Readings will include excerpts from the Qur’an, poetry by Abu Nuwas, excerpts from the 1001 Nights, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alaa al-Aswany, Naguib Mahfuz, Mohamed Choukri, Michel Foucault, Joseph Masad and Rachid al-Daif.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Jonathan Rowan (rowan@berkeley.edu) and Christopher Scott (scott.christopher@berkeley.edu; office 4319 Dwinelle)What is this thing we call “love”? Is it selfish or selfless (or somewhere in between)? Is it something we do, or something that happens to us? Is it merely a matter of emotion, or is rationality involved too? Does it always involve illusion—an idealized image of the beloved? How does literary form capture the experience of love? What happens when the object of love is lost, and the activity of writing takes its place? These are some of the questions we’ll encounter as we read and discuss works of literature from different periods and of different genres (poems, novels, short stories, a play, and a philosophical dialogue) that reflect on romantic love.This course fulfills the second half of the Reading and Composition (R&C) requirement.  Significant time will be given to learning to write well-structured essays with clarity, precision, and force.Texts:Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility

Professor Gretchen HeadThe experience of confinement has historically lent itself to literary expression, yet it has many different forms. Here we will examine three particular types of confinement as they have been voiced in literature in an East/West comparative context: captivity, prison (specifically, the experience of political imprisonment), and the more recent phenomenon of mass incarceration associated with the modern prison industrial complex. The oldest literary texts that address the loss of freedom implicit in imprisonment are captivity narratives, widespread in the early modern period. We will begin with a famous example of this genre that was increasingly common in the sixteenth-century as a result of the frequent clashes between Spain and North Africa. Though most well known for Don Quixote, Cervantes himself was taken prisoner after his ship was attacked by Barbary pirates. His five year stay as a captive in Algiers led to the play, “The Bagnios of Algiers.” His captivity in the royal bagnio allowed him to draw on lived experience, but the prison itself was a space for the most valuable captives, the treatment more lenient. From Cervantes we will move to the less privileged first-person narratives of enslavement taken from Egypt, Sudan, and the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth-century. Our more modern narratives of political imprisonment will primarily be taken from the Arabic tradition (in translation), from twentieth-century Egypt, Iraq, and Morocco. Prison literature in Arabic is its own genre; through these texts we will ask: how can the experience of torture be witnessed in a work of literature? How can the act of writing be accomplished under the conditions that prevail in the most oppressive “secret” prisons, where it is technically forbidden? What is the recuperative function of commemorating the experience of political imprisonment in a literary text? Though a great number of these novels and memoirs were written under the authoritarian regimes of the Arab world, voices from the prison interior are hardly a foreign anomaly. Over the past several decades, mass incarceration in the United States has reached unprecedented numbers. How does the figure of the prisoner inhabit the American imagination? What are the narrative tropes that underpin the ideology of the current prison system? We will look at narratives that address Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib, and California’s San Quentin (through the prison’s own literary journal Open Line) and discuss the ethics of incarceration in its current form.A course reader will contain excerpts from the Libyan writer Omar al-Kikli, the Egyptian writers Omar Hazek’s letters from prison and Nawal El Saadawi’s Memoirs from the Women’s Prison, the Syrian writer Mustafa Khalifa’s The Shell, Elaine Scarry’s The Body in Pain, the American writer George Jackson’s Soledad Brother, Malcom X, Christian Parenti’s Lockdown America, and selected stories from the Iraqi writer Hassan Blasim’s The Corpse Exhibition.Books:

This course approaches the question by addressing one conventional dimension of literary works: genre. Rather than tracing a single literary genre through its formation, development, and dissolution, this course considers several genres (the family tragedy, the gothic novel, the noir film) side by side to get at whether one can distinguish how they are generic. Is it the case that works of the same genre are necessarily concerned with the same subject matter? Do they share a typical structure? A certain look? A set of techniques for making meaning? Convey a special feeling?By juxtaposing canonical works of a genre with particular permutations of it, we will explore how texts produce meaning not only semantically (through a series of grammatical statements), but also indexically by evocatively pointing to other works. Juxtaposing works of different genres also gives students the opportunity to question how genres overlap, drawing on and responding to not only works of the same genre, but also a broader archive of texts. The opportunity to think about genres in relation to each other leads into thinking about them in relation to literary modes such as realism. Ultimately students will have to decide for themselves what status to give the term genre: Is it constitutive of texts – part of how works conceive of themselves and produce meaning? Is it a product of the juxtapositions that we as readers construct – by, for instance, putting works together on a syllabus)? Is it an effect of markets – the fact that readers’ expectations influence authors’ writing and that texts are marketed in ways that readers will recognize? If so, what gives some works the power to define a genre?Focusing on literature, film, and criticism, this course will explore these questions as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. With these goals in mind, members of this course will be asked to illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, periodic posts to a bcourses forum, and consistent in-class participation.Required texts:Henry James, The Turn of the Screw

Celine PiserThe countries that border the Mediterranean Sea span multiple continents and are home to distinct cultures, languages, and politics. But this shared geographic plane has been a site of contact for centuries.  In this course, we will read literature from countries bordering the Mediterranean in an attempt to explore and define the literary, social, linguistic, and political exchanges that took place across the Mediterranean basin. Our texts will highlight different literary traditions, periods, and styles, inviting discussions on fragmented narrative, Orientalism, colonialism, violence, narrative reliability, migration, homeland, memory, community, and exile. We will also read literary and historical theory, both to enhance our discussions and as models of the kind of analytical writing you will do in this class.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Emily LaskinDoes it matter where you live? Can the imagination offer an escape from real life circumstances? How do our physical surroundings change our mental lives? And, conversely, how do our mental lives shape our physical surroundings? This course explores the connection between our internal mental worlds and the here and now of our daily lives. In particular, we’ll focus on several specific regions as we explore the relationships between place and mental life. We’ll read and watch accounts of life in Russia, the British Empire, and the American West, as well as in some purely imaginative settings. And we’ll consider the relationships between where a story is set and how it’s told, and between geographic locations and states of mind.Since this is an R&C course, it emphasizes both close reading and intensive writing. The course will develop students’ abilities to read texts carefully and to analyze the relationship between meaning and textual form. Its other major aim is to help students express increasingly complex ideas in writing. We’ll practice developing and refining analytical arguments, as well as incorporating research in writing projects.Possible texts include:Coetzee Foe
Doig This House of Sky
Gogol selected stories
Joyce selected stories
Lermontov A Hero of Our Times
Oz Panther in the Basement
Shakespeare “The Tempest”

Marianne KaletzkyAll large cities are, in a sense, improbable: accommodating millions of people in a confined space requires vast resources and careful planning. But this course will focus on three cities more unlikely than most: Venice, afloat on wooden piles and perpetually in danger of sinking; St. Petersburg, constructed atop the swampy soils of the Neva River; and Los Angeles, subsisting at the edge of a desert through artificial irrigation.During the course of the semester, we’ll read and watch a series of works that make each city a character in its own right. As we do, we’ll consider common themes of artificiality, precariousness, and decay—all qualities that literature commonly attributes to the cities’ inhabitants as well as to the cities themselves. We’ll devote special attention to the relationship between each text’s form and its setting, examining connections between the physically uncertain foundations of a city and the slippery narrative structures of a text. And we’ll ask why, despite their generally dark view of all three cities, writers can’t seem to stay away from them.Since this is an R and C course, its major goals are to improve students’ skills in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, and to explore the relationships between the three skills. In addition to discussing the texts in class, students will write responses to them in a variety of forms, from literary analysis essays to creative projects.Required texts:Andrei Bely, Petersburg (trans. Robert A. Maguire and John E. Malmstead)
Thomas Mann, Death in Venice (trans. Michael Henry Heim)
Thomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49
William Shakespeare, The Merchant of VeniceRequired screenings:Howard Hawks, The Big Sleep

Vesna RodicThis course will explore literary representations of the self and its transformations across time, situations and contexts. We will read texts that represent the development of one’s identity in relation to the experience of time, the material world, interaction with others, the thought process, and, the act of writing.  In our study of the formation and transformation of one’s identity, we will encounter physical, psychological and allegorical changes of the self. During the course of the semester, we will consider the following questions: Which phenomena and situations can trigger a change in a person? What aspects of one’s identity are particularly susceptible to transformation? Can a person really change, and to what extent? Our aim will be to understand how these metamorphoses inform one’s sense of individuality as well as one’s understanding of their place in society.Required Texts:William Shakespeare, Othello
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Reveries of a Solitary Walker

Johnathan VakninO what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?
Walt Whitman, “Voices”This is a course about absent presences, or entities that refuse to remain hidden in the shadows of history; straddling the porous border between here and there, past and present, death and life, the phantasms that populate our readings force us to rethink the linear unfolding of time. Some of the ghosts that we’ll encounter this semester carry with them remnants of historical trauma and violence—the vestiges, reverberations, and reincarnations of slavery, for instance, in Toni Morrison’s Beloved. Others, such as King Hamlet’s ghost in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, lead us to ask what it might mean to mourn—or not to mourn—the loss of a loved one. While most of our readings will take the form of literary works, we’ll also watch a number of films, including Ghost and The Others, paying close attention both to how ghosts are represented and to what their effects on us are.As part of the University’s R&C sequence, this course is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical reading and writing skills. In addition to regular essay assignments—including frequent revisions—students will also learn how to conduct scholarly research and to incorporate this research into their argumentative compositions.Readings and films will possibly draw from the following:Toni Morrison, Beloved
William Shakespeare, Hamlet
Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway
Julio Cortázar, “House Taken Over” (Casa tomada)
Juan Rulfo, Pedro Páramo
Wanda Coleman, “American Sonnet (35)”

Maya KronfeldThe concept of point of view seems familiar enough — after all, everyone seems to have one. But as a key technique of literary experimentation and innovation, point of view becomes something radically unfamiliar. In this course we will engage a variety of literary traditions in order to study — and develop our own arguments about — how authors structure point of view differently. What kinds of possibilities and limitations are associated with the first-person point of view, or the third-person point of view? Is there such a thing as a collective point of view? Why do social and political issues frequently involve discussions of point of view? How are points of view related to the human bodies from which they seem to emanate? Is there such a thing as a disembodied point of view? We will study fiction and poetry in order to develop a sharp set of critical tools for thinking through such problems of perspective. Beginning with our first novel, Victor Hugo’s The Last Day of a Condemned Man, we will explore some of the challenges that social conditions impose on point of view, and on the very concept of point of view. We will also explore some philosophical and literary traditions which have theorized about point of view as a problem of consciousness, fiction, or both. Point of view helps us think about what we know, but also the conditions under which we know it.Finally, the goal of this Reading and Composition course is to develop your critical point of view as an academic writer. Through frequent practice — and, crucially, revision — we will experience how writing extends our ability to think. Drawing on supplementary materials including handouts on logic and other tools of critical thinking, we will devote one class period per week to a writing workshop where we work collaboratively.Required books:Victor Hugo, The Last Day of a Condemned Man

Irene HsiaoIn this course, we will think about what transformation means as we read myths, poems, plays, and stories. Using selected texts as testing grounds for our inquiry, we will consider shifts in outward form and shifts in inward feeling.  We will pay attention to model narratives of transformative experience, including stories of awakening, love, and death, and attempt to develop a system of understanding the causes and consequences of individual and environmental change. We will also necessarily think about form—the form of a story, the form of a poem—how we recognize it and why. Students will practice close reading and write two essays, as well as devise a research project of their own choosing that they will present to the class.Required Texts:

A. Gadberry & P. Gerard“The best way to bind them is to burden them with guilt, cover them with blood, compromise them as much as possible, thus establishing a bond of complicity so that they can no longer turn back.”– Primo Levi, The Drowned and the SavedWhat makes a bystander “innocent,” and what problems arise when guilt seems not to reside solely, and tidily, in one “evil” person?  What happens if or when there’s no one who’s not, at least a little bit, a “bad guy”?  Our course will attempt to unpack the problem of complicity as we study a variety of texts that ask where guilt lies, how justice works (if and when it does), and what it means to be an observer (or reader!) at moments of ethical trespass.  Reading works from a range of national literatures and from historical periods prior to our own, we will examine the constitution of innocence and the role of spectacle and spectatorship as we attempt to uncover how these earlier conversations shape (or diverge from) our current conversations about complicity and collusion interpersonally and internationally.  Of particular importance to our inquiry will be asking what methods of resistance or resignation works of art might supply and how the literary distributes or evades blame.As we think about these questions, we will also be studying the craft of writing and revising the research paper.  Students can expect to write and revise two papers, give an in-class presentation, and complete several smaller assignments.WorksCharles Baudelaire, “Héautontimorouménos”

This course will examine texts that are concerned with the education of their characters. We’ll look at the literary representation of various sites of schooling across multiple continents and centuries, from the governess-run nursery to the urban public school, from the boarding school to the world beyond its walls, and we’ll ask what can be learned and taught within these spaces, and also why some texts might make us skeptical about them. We’ll consider how these texts reflect on and enact the development—or, in some cases, the dissolution— of the young protagonists whom we follow through their pages, and we’ll move through the perspectives of the child, the adolescent, and the educator to question how and where significant life lessons are learned. We’ll also interrogate why these works of fiction take such an interest in narratives of personal development and how they envision their own role in such a formative process. To this end, the course will encourage self-reflective practice among its members, asking how encounters with fictional worlds might factor into our own continuing self-formation. Most importantly, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading and analytical writing skills with these fictions of education as our common terrain, learning to become more careful readers and thinkers and to advance increasingly complex interpretive arguments about literary texts. Required Texts:The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Muriel Spark

J. Hock and P. GerardIn The Republic, Plato condemps poetry for being too far removed from reality. A feeble imitation of the world (itself an imitation of ideal Ideas), poetry isn’t really “true” and thus distorts our understanding of the world and is a bad influence on young people. In the Poetics, Aristotle argues that didactic, or scientific, verse isn’t really poetry. From the Greeks onwards, we have tended to distinguish poetry and science as different modes of thought with different relationships to truth or the real, and different functions in society. This course will take a long view of this troubled history and read in the history of science, poetry, and poetic theory to question the traditional generic boundaries between scientific and literary texts and practices. From the farming manual that is Virgil’s Georgics to contemporary scholarship that uses neurological advances to analyze literature to science fiction from all periods, we will question the boundaries between science and literature and the practice of each.Reading List: Readings will likely include selections from the following works and authors, among others. They will be available at the University bookstore, in the course reader, or on bSpace.Hesiod, TheogonyPlato, RepublicOvid, Metamorphoses

Jordan GreenwaldIn this course, we will analyze drama, films, poems and novels that offer us entry points for thinking about the (all too) familiar yet surprisingly complex feeling of disappointment. Unlike the more sensational category of despair or the clinical category of depression, disappointment presents itself as something we can deal with because of its status as a frequent, even everyday occurrence. And yet disappointment can be great or minor, chronic or acute, existential or forgettable.Just as disappointment can come to us in different forms in life (a rejection letter, a canceled rendezvous, the gradual realization of one’s limitations), in this course we will think about what kinds of “shapes” or genres the idea of disappointment requires when it’s represented in literature and film. What can a novel show us about disappointment that a melodrama or tragedy can’t? A poem? What value can we find in literature that disappoints us in its departure from convention or its refusal to provide the closure of a happy ending? And finally, following Langston Hughes’s famous question, “What happens to a dream deferred?”This is a writing-intensive course, and we will explore all of these questions as a means of developing writing skills. Students will write and re-write a number of essays, and writing “workshops” will occur on a weekly basis. The final portion of the course will be spent on learning research skills, and will culminate in a research paper on one of the texts we have studied.Novels:

Fictions of Technology, Science and SocietyIn this course we will develop writing and argumentative skills through exploring theoretical and imaginative texts that revolve around technology, science and social order. We will read texts that take up the questions of artificial intelligence and human attachment (Ex-Machina), the relation between justice and techniques of scientific prediction (Foundation, Minority Report), and time travel (The Time Machine) among others. We will watch several contemporary films and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on sci-fi and utopian/distopian fiction. The following questions will underlie a few of our discussions: can humans attach to inanimate machines and if so what do such attachments teach us about relationships with humans? Why are we both fascinated and deeply anxious about the possibility of artificial intelligence such as cyborgs and robots? Why do science and scientific innovation are used as models to imagine perfect societies and why such models usually fail? How do sci-fi texts encode implicit utopian wishes and why is the genre a ripe site for such social thinking?Required BooksIsaac Asimov, Foundation and Empire

Brian ClancyThe purpose of this course is to improve your ability to write clearly, effectively, and accurately about literary subjects. The course works under the assumption that critical writing–and the kinds of thinking that lead to such writing–are a necessity for college students. The ability to write critically also represents a very significant step in one’s intellectual development more generally. The focus of this class will be on practicing the fundamental skills of writing and reading, both in class and out of class. Our topic as we do so will be totality.Totalities (whether literary, social, or political) are rarely fixed entities. Totality entails both thinking about the world according to a wider scope, but also placing particular phenomena in relation to this broader whole. Our aim in this course is to consider the diverse ways in which totalities arise, with a special focus on literature. Thinking about totality enhances our understanding of how literary works present their readers with encompassing structures and relations. It shows us how the mind collects groups of phenomena and attempts to contain them through varying degrees of closure or more elastic rubrics. Totalities often group things through resemblance to other systems of consolidation.When the concept of totality appears in literature, it signifies images of the whole, as well as new relations between the whole and its parts. Here totalities are literary constructions and they are fabricated or delimited for different purposes. Totalities rarely exist in isolation, instead, they overlap, as is so often the case with competing notions of social totality.Totality is a fecund concept. It can explain a language system. It can be a way to conceive of a human body and the trajectories of movement it makes. Totality even arises in everyday contexts through spatial movements which take place when urban dwellers engage in leisurely walks. Instead of thinking about totality as unlimited or ambiguous, we will examine it in terms of specific themes: movement and mobility, time, perception, and fluctuation. That said, we will primarily focus on this concept in terms of literary genre, the set of criteria which helps us to define different types of literary expression.Writing literary works (and academic essays) involves rules which apply to the whole. The dynamic notion of literary totality will help us to explain developments and fluctuations in the rules for a genre like the novel. At the course’s inception, we will see how in Aristotle’s Poetics, totality involves a theory of genre for the forms of literature called tragedy and epic, while also stressing the value of a coherent plot with proper magnitude. We will then see how notions of totality are at the heart of Miguel de Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote. In Cervantes’ we will consider the emergence of the novel genre, seeing how overlapping and emergent notions of totality shed light on the question of literary world-formation.Later, focusing on a period in the early 20th-century known as modernism, we will see how through diverse literary experiments the rules of the novel can be rewritten. For example, we will look at how in Ulysses, James Joyce reconceived of the novel as a new type of literary whole. Totality also involves questions of time. Here we will see how modernist works like those of Joyce and Virginia Woolf approach the concept of totality through a literary interpretation of the idea of infinity.Our notion of totality also extends beyond genre and time. Joyce’s Dublin and Woolf’s London, respectively, re-imagine urban space. We can thus create mental shapes of totalities through a complex “cognitive mapping” (Fredric Jameson’s term) that reconstructs urban space in terms of part and whole. Here we will turn to the French philosopher Michel de Certeau’s The Practice of Everyday Life and his notionof “the itinerary.” For de Certeau, walking in the city creates different modes of an idea called “synecdoche” (the replacement of part for whole). Buttressed by brief selections from the work of the 18th-century British Empiricist David Hume, we will examine how the mind forms an idea of spatial totality on the basis of the impressions of objects. We wish to see how our impressions and ideas of space cohere (or fail to cohere) into stable images of totality or reliable narratives.In examining these pressing issues, we will perform a significant amount of detailed analysis of various literary texts as well as analytic writing. We will learn how to perform sophisticated close-readings of passages from the assigned texts. Special focus will be placed on identifying and examining different literary techniques that authors employ as well as the effects of these literary techniques. We then plan to develop these dynamic interpretative skills in conjunction with learning how to formulate arguments and write well-structured papers. Ultimately the goal of the course is to learn how to write a superb academic essay, and to think in more clear, specific, and effective ways about literature and the arts in general.Texts:Aristotle, The Poetics

Taylor Johnston & Yael SegalovitzWhen do you most often feel bored or distracted? In class? Reading dense theoretical texts? Scrolling through your Facebook newsfeed? Or when you’re alone and reflective? Both literature and popular culture have lamented these affective states as a result of our fragmented, media-saturated realities, in which political consciousness is withering and the stimulant market is thriving. This class would like to simply ask: are boredom and distraction always bad? Do the hegemonic structures in which we live leave us bored? Or is boredom actually a subversive status from which we can recover our reflective and critical capacities? Likewise, although distraction is most often represented as a failure of attention and understanding, can we consider it a kind of knowledge or even a productive mode of reading? We will pursue these inquiries and track how they are configured in the form and content of literary texts. As a reading and composition class, we’ll be using our discussions as a foundation for improving analytical and persuasive writing.Texts:

Noa Bar Hannah Arendt describes the modern political revolution as a kind of narrative, as an attempt to write “an entirely new story, a story never known or told before.” However, Arendt goes on to question the accepted notion that the “plot” of the modern revolution necessarily culminates in the creation of an entirely new order which establishes a foundation for equality and self-governance.In this course, we will follow both the connection Arendt makes between political revolution and literary narrative and heed her insight that revolution may not lead to unprecedented political freedom.  Looking at a variety of textual forms (novel, short story, graphic novel, film), including the work of Marjane Satrapi (Iran, Austria), Assia Djebar (Algeria) we will explore the following questions and tensions involved in revoution: How does the personal affect the political and vice-versa?  How can practices of everyday life become resistance (Satrapi, DeCerteau) What happens when a movement of national liberation from colonial rule nonetheless leaves gender inequality in place (Djebar)  How can modes of representation of political causes either open up or foreclose possibilities of rupture with old orders?Just as revolution is an attempt to revise history, we will focus on our own process of revision as writers.  We will write multiple drafts for all assignments, which will be reviewed both by the instructor and by peers.  We will have a series of writing workshops throughout the semester which will present the writing process in concrete steps—from the simple act of making observations about a text, to techniques of close reading, and finally to constructing arguments.Reading List:Hannah Arendt, On Revolution (excerpts)

Margarita GordonWe tend to view fact and fiction as polar opposites, opposites that shape our concept of knowledge, truth, and morality. Yet when we speak of “actual fact” in contrast to “mere fiction,” we often take for granted or simply ignore the basis for differentiating them from one another. In this course, we will endeavor to define the precepts—cultural, philosophical, and psychological—that govern this distinction. More radically, we will ask to what extent the distinction holds up.What counts as fact or fiction and how, even within a given world (or text), might that shift? What constitutes evidence or proof? How do we assess an account’s motivation, form, or context? How do audiences within and outside the text establish whether a source is credible—or the most credible—particularly when versions of the same event radically diverge from one another? And how might the audience’s judgment vary in turn?How do we grapple with whether someone or something even exists (or existed)? How do we gauge the plausibility of an event? What rhetorical strategies does a text employ to signal realness or authenticity? Are certain genres, like journalism or photography, inherently more authentic than others? What is the truth status of prophecies or propaganda?If different texts have different standards for fact and fiction, and any representation or reaction is a product of a subjective point of view, is all truth relative? Or is there such a thing as absolute or objective truth, and if so, what form does it take?Texts may include:Plato, selections from Republic

Andrea Gadberry“Elegy,” the Romantic poet and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge remarked, “is the form of poetry natural to the reflective mind. It may treat of any subject, but it must treat of no subject for itself; but always and exclusively with reference to the poet himself. As he will feel regret for the past or desire for the future, so sorrow and love become the principle themes of elegy. Elegy presents every thing as lost and gone, or absent and future.” This semester, we will put Coleridge’s definition to the test as we study elegiac poems as well as other literary forms preoccupied with what happens when “every thing” might seem to be “lost and gone.”As we read across genres and national traditions, we will ask how works of art grapple with burial and mourning, how they commemorate the dead – or, sometimes, bring them back to life. Our inquiry will begin with the careful study of elegiac poems from several traditions, but we will also be interested in how other genres (novel, play, speech, film, essay) develop elegiac idioms of their own. How do these (often highly self-conscious) works deal with the question of a self that has lost an essential attachment? How do these texts construct identities for their speakers and narrators; in what ways, for instance, are expressions of sorrow and melancholy gendered or culturally coded? How might works about personal loss intersect with broader communities (the family, the state) or address their readers? How do poems of loss portray and interact with place? What is the relationship between grief and time: what are the temporalities of loss, how are they conveyed in form, and what is this “absent and future” space Coleridge imagines?Books:
Anne Carson, Nox

D. Thow“The word “translation” comes, etymologically, from the Latin for “bearing across.” Having been borne across the world, we are translated men.” –Salman Rushdie, “Imaginary Homelands”Translation is everywhere.  But what is it, exactly?  The term is often used to mean anything transferred, adapted, communicated, displaced or interpreted. What does it mean when something is “lost in translation”?  What is the difference between a translator and an author?  In this class will examine translation as a creative process that bears meaning from one language to another, and think about many of the metaphors implied by the term. We will also examine the figure of the translator as a character in literature and film as someone who enables movement, transferal, transformation, adaptation, interpretation, but also loss.We will read many works of literature in translation and perform close comparative readings of various short translated passages over the course of the semester.   Our focus in this class will be to hone our analytical reading and writing skills, and translation will therefore serve as a model, one that makes interpretative claims about the meaning of a text.Course objectives:This is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper.  We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper.Required textsWilliam Shakespeare, The Tempest

J. Greenwald & K. CrimThis course will examine a long legacy of cultural fascination with domestic space and its iconic caretaker, the housewife.  We will discuss literary texts and films that feature housewives as their protagonists – from Shakespeare to Virginia Woolf to the present.  Our task will be twofold: we will work to appreciate, on the one hand, how the texts engage with a longstanding (and ongoing) feminist critique of the tethering of women to domestic labor; on the other hand, we will try to understand why the housewife endures as a key aspect of the fantasy of “the good life.” What can literary representations of housewives tell us about the aspirations and assumptions surrounding our everyday lives – in the past and in the present?This is a writing-intensive course, and we will explore all of these issues as a means of refining writing skills.  Students will write and re-write a number of essays, and writing “workshops” will occur on a weekly basis.  The final portion of the course will be spent on developing research skills, and will culminate in a research paper on one of the texts we have studied.Required Texts:Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary

M. KaletzkyWhat’s the opposite of laughter? The tear? The sigh? Or the particularly grave, slightly condescending expression of the person who informs us, reproachfully, that a situation is serious and therefore “no laughing matter?”Insanity, terrorism, totalitarianism, class conflict, racial tension, famine, murder, hopelessness, and, of course, death: the texts we’ll study in this class concern themselves with the most serious subject matter possible. And yet each text is also essentially and irrefutably funny. As we discuss them, we’ll ask whether comedy can also work as social critique, how humor might help us face the dark realities of life, and why laughing matters.The goals of this course fall into two categories: reading and writing. The course will develop students’ abilities to read texts closely and carefully, to examine both points of coherence and moments of tension within them, and to analyze the relationship between meaning and textual form. The other major aim is to help students express increasingly complex ideas in writing. The various writing activities in the class, from the major analytical essays to shorter creative exercises, will connect critical thinking and writing, improve students’ control over their writing voice, and introduce new ways of thinking about structure and development.Texts:Novels:

Brian Clancy & Keith FordThis course focuses on the impression as a unique mode of visual, philosophical, and literary experience. When people hear the word “impression” in the context of the history of art, they often think of the French Impressionists of the late-19th century. But the notion of the impression as a mode of perception has a much broader intellectual history, and it will be the goal of this course to present students with a grasp of its dynamic history, as well as its theoretical scope in an interdisciplinary sense. We will start by examining how the impression plays a major role in the development of British Empiricism throughout David Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature (1739-1740), learning how the impression’s “metaphorical ambiguity” makes it into what the literary critic Jesse Matz calls a “theoretical problem solver.” We will also look at the role the impression plays in the development of analytic philosophy in the work of Bertrand Russell. We will explore questions like: how is an impression different from the idea of an image or a ready-to-point-to picture? How has the impression been set aside from images and ideas to constitute its own distinct rhetorical and/or aesthetic status? How does literary impressionism effect the assumptions of a variety of classical literary categories? How does the impression serve as a basis for constructing knowledge of the world? How did the impression alter certain fundamental criteria in the nature of visual representation within the history of art? With this broad grounding in the impression’s strong links to philosophical theories of knowledge, we will delve into the problem of the impression and visual experience more specifically, reading works by the art critic Roger Fry on French Impressionism. Throughout the course, we will also read works in the literary impressionism of authors like Mallarmé and Woolf. In examining these pressing issues, we will perform a significant amount of detailed analysis and analytic writing. We will learn how to perform sophisticated close-readings of passages from the assigned texts. Special focus will be placed on identifying and examining different literary techniques that authors employ as well as the effects of these literary techniques. We then plan to develop these dynamic interpretative skills in conjunction with learning how to formulate arguments.Texts:Aristotle, The Poetics

R. McGlazer and J. SaidenbergIn this course, we’ll think and write about literature’s fascination with shipwrecks and their aftermath.  We’ll cross a number of seas and several centuries in order to ask what accounts for this fascination and what, if anything, might be left of it today.  How do desert islands, for all their devastation, come to represent alternative worlds and to shelter new forms of social life?  How do stranded sailors, for all their destitution, come to embody rich and strange relational possibilities and political positions, ranging from the individualist to the radically interdependent? How do shipwrecked texts underwrite or contest narratives of colonial conquest and contemporary development?  What does it mean to be at sea with a text, and what can we gain in our thinking and writing from the literary experience of being lost?This is a writing-intensive course, which means we’ll work to answer these and related questions in concrete and convincing ways, using evidence from texts, rather than speculation, to substantiate arguments.  Students will write three essays: one short diagnostic paper and two longer papers, both of which will require thoughtful and thorough revision.  Students will also be asked to keep a “desert island reading journal,” logging in less formal (and, if they’d like, more creative) ways their responses to the readings assigned.  Additional short assignments, targeting specific aspects of essay writing, will also be required.Texts will include some the following:Homer, Odyssey (Book 6)
Virgil, Aeneid (Book 4)

—Bilbo BagginsBefore we even set out on a journey, the places we go are invested with meaning and, often, idealized goals. Inevitably, there is a dissonance between destination and dream. Perhaps accounting for this, in literature, many travelers are bound to entirely fictitious destinations. And yet, the fiction is as revealing as any fact when considering why we are driven to travel. What values and expectations does the traveler carry with him, perhaps unwittingly? How are indigenous populations represented? What are the social and political motivations for both travel texts and utopian texts? In order to investigate these and other questions, this course will engage with texts both factual and fictional such as Plato’s Timaeus and selections from Republic, Lucian’s Trips to the Moon, Virgil’s Eclogues, Thomas More’s Utopia, de Bergerac’s Voyage to the Moon, selections from Thevet’s Singularities of Antarctic France and Lery’s True Voyage to Brazil and from Montaigne’s Essays, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Aimé Césaire’s “A Tempest,” selections from Gulliver’s Travels (the Liliputians and the Houyhnhnms), Bernardin de Saint Pierre’s Paul & Virginia, John Clare’s poem “The Lamentations of Round-Oak Waters”, Alexander Pope’s “A Discourse on Pastoral Poetry,” Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Addison, Spectator #11 & 414, and selections from Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.This is a reading and writing intensive course with several essay assignments which will build upon the skills acquired in R1A. We will approach academic writing as a process, and students will articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying while entering the world of literary criticism and learning to integrate and interrogate criticism in their own writing.

Mary Renolds & Philip Gerard“What wood is this before us?”
Macbeth, 5.4.6Even today we sometimes find ourselves before a landscape. Out car windows or on TV, on holiday or behind a bulldozer, this special category still presses itself on our imaginations, unseating us from our routines and casting us into an alternate context, a terrain seditmented out of its own history, vocabulary, tropes and moods.How does this happen? How have such seemingly uninhabited tracts of land become peopled with so many of our wishes, memories and fears? What do we see from the top of a mountain, and how does the view compare to the kinds of perspectives opened up by literature, painting, and film? By what cunning, for example, can art transform the sight of an idle countryside or unspoiled wilderness into the site of imaginative construction—whether of us as citizens, as subjects, or as readers? Our course will consider these and other questions as we explore the aesthetic and cultural significance of landscape across a selection of national traditions and a range of historical periods. Of particular importance to our inquiry will be asking how these earlier figurations of landscape shape (or diverge from) our contemporary conversations about the environment and economic development on both the local and the international scene.As we think about these questions, we will also be studying the craft of writing and revising a research paper. Students can expect to write and revise two papers, give an in-class presentation, and complete several smaller assignments. Required Books:William Shakespeare, Macbeth (Folger) ISBN: 0743477103

Caitlin Scholl & Jenny TanThis course explores the relationship between the plotting of narratives and the plotting of conspiracies. We will read and view texts from a wide range of time periods, world regions, and genres—from Greek tragedy to French Harlequin comedy to American film noir to Congolese dystopian novel—paying attention to the ways in which the intrigue in the storylines thematizes not only the construction of the narratives themselves, but also the acts of reading and interpretation. What is the relationship between writers and the conspirators that they write about? Between readers and the detectives (broadly defined) that they read about? What happens when these relationships break down? In our discussions we will also consider the ideological, political, and aesthetic implications of different kinds of plot logic. What does it mean for the truth to be revealed—or not revealed, as the case may be? We will supplement our thinking about these questions by reading critical essays from theorists such as Peter Brooks, Roland Barthes, Tzvetan Todorov, Walter Benjamin, Richard Kearney, and Gérard Genette.This is a writing-intensive course. Students will learn how to develop interesting arguments about the texts that we are studying, incorporate research in their writing, and refine their ideas through their drafting and revision of several essays. As this is a course on plotting, we will focus in particular on how to incorporate intrigue and narrative in the development of analytical arguments.Possible texts that we will read/view include:Plays
Sophocles, Oedipus Rex
Shakespeare, The Tempest or Othello

C. Piser & J. TanIn this course we’ll study the connections between multilingualism, multiculturalism, and marginalized communities in literature. We’ll look at different ways of storytelling to determine how narratives are structured formally and linguistically. We will read literature as a political tool for the assertion of a marginalized identity, and to this end, question the use of multilingualism in the representation of multicultural communities. We will look at space as well – both the space of identity formation, and the space of communities living on the margins, separated by race, culture, ethnicity, language, and class. We will read literature from a wide variety of cultural and linguistic traditions, and our discussions will be informed by critical readings.This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, and two analytical research papers.Primary Texts will be chosen from the following:The Old Testament
Honoré de Balzac, “Sarrasine”
Erez Biton, “Summary of a Conversation” and “Shopping Song on Dizengoff”
Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Dictee
Michel de Montaigne, “On Cannibals”

B. Ruberg & C. GoldblattLike the time traveler revisiting to a fateful moment in history, literary and sci-fi authors alike return again and again to the theme of time travel. The trope dates back as far as mythology, appearing in early Jewish and Japanese texts. More recently, in the century following H. G. Wells’ Time Machine, innumerable characters have been hopping across the space/time continuum.  The popularity of these stories — A Wrinkle in Time, The Time Traveler’s Wife — challenge us to question: what about time travel, as a literary device and a thought experiment, so compels us? Dr. Who, the most prominent pop culture time traveler, has been on the air for sixty years! We might even extend the topic of time travel to include memoirs, historical fiction, anachronisms: all textual attempts to retell fact and self through temporal displacement.This course will stress both literary analysis and writing skills. Creative exercises will be paired with close readings and writing workshops, while we explore the history and attraction of time travel in fiction.Reading ListThe Time Machine, H.G. Wells (1895)

Course Description:Contemporary debates about cultural matters often appeal to nature to decide them. Parties debating a cultural issue will attempt a familiar gesture: each will claim that its position is natural and therefore true. What relationship between society and nature does this appeal assume?  Why is nature seen as factually accurate or true?  Why would an appeal to nature decide a cultural issue?Reading literary and theoretical works from different cultures and historical moments, we will identify and compare the multiplicity of “natures” that have been generated in these different contexts.  By continuation, we will explore the implications of different modes of seeing the relationship between the culture and nature: as one of opposition, continuity, ambivalence, etc.Throughout our exploration of literature, nature, culture, you will think about the argumentative appropriation of nature in contemporary debates about gender, race, class, sexual orientation; development versus conservation; local versus global; old versus new; science versus religion; man versus animal; and individual versus collective.In addition to focusing on the ways in which nature and culture appear in the texts, we will also examine the role of fiction in shaping our cultural values and public policies with regards to nature. Why would one choose the written word as an approach to the natural world in the first place? What can literature as fiction do that other ways of thinking about nature cannot? Most urgently, what kind of solutions or insights can literature offer to address problems and tensions in the world beyond the written page?Throughout the semester, we will ask how reading about fictional worlds can be a means of better understanding our lived world: how do the situations and characters we encounter in the texts invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and decisions? In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument.Possible Reading List:CL R1B:1

P. ChatterjiThis is not a class about Facebook. However, we will think about how contemporary experiences of social networking can help us to describe relationships between individuals, social systems, and the connections between them. We will trace back some of these issues by reading books and watching films that predate contemporary social networks. Particular attention will be paid to the role of technology. In the works that we encounter, technologies of communication – the letter, the apartment building, the telephone, the computer – play a large role in our understanding of the content of the message, the purpose of communicating, the boundary between public and private, our notion of belonging in a community, and even our sense of self.This is a writing intensive course. We will spend considerable time in class on improving students’ writing skills by working on clarity, argument development and research basics. Students will participate in writing workshops and be asked to complete two papers, one of which will be a research project.

It is about putting life back in where only a vague memory or a bare trace was visible to those who bothered to look.[1] Taking cues from Avery Gordon, this course will consider seriously the matter of ghosts in literary texts. Ghosts are not simply the incorporeal return of the dead associated with religious or spiritual practices and beliefs. Rather, they are public, social figures whose haunting can take us to “that dense site where history and subjectivity make social life.”[2] Their practice of haunting underscores contemporary concerns about narratives of exclusion and silencing, as well as the concern with what can actually be known and the ethical considerations that such investigations should demand. The course will ask the following: 1) What is the political status of ghosts in memory, commemoration, and the nostalgia of exile? 2) What can our study of ghosts reveal about the historical and linguistic structures that are the sources of their haunting? 3) What conceptual and ethical dilemmas must we confront in such an investigation? 4) How do we capture the ghostly-speak?

Jordan Bulger and Sydney CochranIn this course we will investigate the imaginative worlds of literature and visual art, exploring what they teach us about the nature and experience of happiness. We will discuss the emotions of such perversely isolated individuals as Melville’s Bartleby, who chooses not to engage with the world around him, and such morally questionable characters as Nabokov’s Humbert Humbert, whose love both sustains and deceives him. We will consider what it means for Gregor, in Kafka’s Metamorphosis, to find himself a stranger to his own skin; what the characters gain in Aristophanes’ Women at the Thesmophoria as they dress in drag and create identity through costume; and how two African American women, in Larsen’s Passing, struggle to understand the meaning of race in a society that sees only in black and white. What emotions do these experiences bring forward and what happiness, if any, is available to each character?Beyond culling examples of happiness from these texts and others, we will examine how each work’s respective style and form add to our understanding of the emotions involved in these experiences. A love poem and a romantic movie may both reveal the joys of passionate love, but in what ways do their respective media (poetry versus film) and
the artistic options available to each medium shape our comprehension and appreciation of love? We will consider too how fiction, as opposed to other forms of expression, has unique mechanisms for conveying and exploring emotion. How might a novel teach us about happiness, for instance, in different ways than a psychology book?  When we read fiction critically, furthermore, we explore on dead paper a world of characters whose choices, whether they lead to
disappointment or to triumph, invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and choices. While focusing on what it means to be happy in work and in love, in our communities and with our bodies, we will also strive to gain new power in expressing our ideas and observations with clarity and good argument. Whether happily or unhappily, you will write several research papers in this course, in addition to shorter writing assignments, designed to develop your reading, writing, researching, thinking, and even your living skills to their fullest potential.Principal Texts:Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov

D. Inciarte & K. Kadue The Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read sections from Raman Selden’s, A Reader’s Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory, which will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.Please buy the editions specifically ordered for this class.Course ReadingPlato, Symposium ISBN 0-14-044024-0Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel, selected chaps from Book 1 ISBN 0-14-044-047Cervantes, Don Quixote, 1st five chapters, 0-06-093434-4Nabokov, Pale Fire, 0-425-03784-3Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice (any edition)Bernhard, Old Masters 0-226-04391-6Calvino, If on a Winter’s Night a TravelerStrunk & White, Elements of Style 0-205-31342-6 In reader: Selections from Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Franz Kafka, Lucretius, Clément Marot, Shakespeare (sonnets), Shirley Jackson, Mary Oliver, Wislawa SzymborskaMovies: Dancer in the Dark Syllabus

This course will explore the interplay of drama and tedium in day-to-day life. All of the works we will read eschew a purely heroic or marvelous mode and instead focus on petty concerns or mundane experience. But these texts do so in a way that is far from ordinary or boring; each offers a distinct creative perspective on everyday life. Some of the works we’ll read highlight the intense and dramatic undercurrents of routine existence. For example, Virginia Woolf “tunnels” deep into the inner life of a middle-aged woman who views each day as a “dangerous” feat; Nikolai Gogol turns a bureaucrat’s quest for a new coat in a darkly humorous, overblown farce; and Emily Dickinson, although she hardly left her room, wrote poetry suffused with extremes of despair, exultation, passion, faith and doubt. Other texts take the opposite approach, underlining the contrast between our romantic dreams and the monotony of daily experience. Euripides, for example, will show us how a heroic quest deteriorates into bickering and jealousy; Platonov, one of the most remarkable writers of the Soviet era, portrays the tragic failure of utopian hopes; and Chekhov’s plays offer masterful depictions of lassitude and gradually fading ambition. As we read each text, we’ll discuss how it illuminates the intertwined monotony and intensity of everyday experience, but we’ll also move beyond the course topic to read each text for its own sake, paying attention to multiple prominent themes and motifs. We will also devote substantial class time to instruction in argumentative writing and research skills. As in all R&C courses, you will write several papers. The ultimate goal of the course is to develop your critical thinking and writing skills as well as your ability to enjoy the creative complexity of literary texts.Texts:Platonov, The Foundation PitWoolf, Mrs. DallowayChekhov, The SeagullGogol, “The Overcoat”Dickinson, selected poetryEuripides, MedeaCL R1B:12

R. FalkoffThis course is dedicated to three figures that lurk at the fringes of capitalism and seem to represent at once the epitome, the inverse, and even the undoing of its logics. Our aim will be to shed light on the contemporary obsession with hoarding by studying the hoarder in relation to two precursors of 19th and 20th century narrative and theory: the fetishist and the collector. We will examine the material practices and psychic mechanisms that define these identities and authorize distinctions between them, as well as the diverse historical contexts from which they emerge. More broadly, we will theorize the relationships between objects and narrative.Our study of the fetishist begins with writings by Freud and Marx, along with selections from the vast body of theoretical work they inspired. Christian Metz’ “Photography and the Fetish” will propel our examination of still and moving images in short films dedicated to possessions: Miska Draskoczy’s “Here’s the Thing” webisodes and Martin Hampton’s Possessed. The unit on collecting will include the novel Cousin Pons by Honoré de Balzac, as well as William Davies King’s memoir Collections of Nothing. Moving from the collector to the hoarder, we will first consider the distinctions between collecting and accumulating set out by Susan Stewart in On Longing and Jean Baudrillard in System of Objects, then turn to contemporary texts dedicated to hoarding: E. L. Doctorow’s 2009 novel Homer and Langley, Jessie Sholl’s 2010 memoir Dirty Secret: A Daughter Comes Clean About Her Mother’s Compulsive Hoarding, and Randy Frost and Gail Steketee’s 2010 Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things, as well as episodes of Bones and CSI.Coursework will include readings and reading-responses, active participation in class discussions and frequent writing assignments and revisions. Regular attendance and participation is required. You will be encouraged to think critically about your own as well as others’ ideas, and you will learn how to express your interpretations in a coherent and cohesive way.

In thinking about various genres, we will ask questions about how the past is described and sometimes reimagined or mythified in relation to the present.  As we consider various ways of referencing, establishing, or more generally writing and talking about a before and an after, we will particularly consider the aftermath of personal and historical change, problems of discussing the self and its experience, and the form of the first person voice. Regular class assignments emphasize close reading and writing skills. Requirements include one 6 page midterm paper and one 10 page final paper with research component. The syllabus includes works by Franz Kafka, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Sigmund Freud, Marguerite Duras, Assia Djebar, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Rainer Maria Rilke, Jamaica Kincaid.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

J. Bulger The term “Modernism” coarsely describes a cultural movement that began during the sunset of the nineteenth century and continued into the first half of the twentieth century.  Modernists experimented with new ideas and forms in order to liberate their arts from tradition.  Yet as artists strove headlong into the future, they did look in the rear-view mirror to the distant past – to antiquity.  In particular, Greek and Roman ideas, forms and texts litter the modernist literary canon as modernist authors translate and transmute the works of classical antiquity in order to advance their artistic projects.This course will examine the modernists’ engagement of classical Greek and Roman works.  Why does the modernist author use the ancient in a project to create the new?  How does the author give a new voice to ancient ideas and forms?  What is lost or gained in the shuttling of material between 2000 years?  How can ancient material refer to a modern context?  As a reader, what is our relationship with the modern text, if we know the ancient source?Our readings will focus on a series of paired texts – one classical and one modern.  We will begin in the 19th century and see how authors are using classical texts so as to highlight the differences or similarities found in the modernists.  In our journey between periods and texts, we will get to know figures such as Odysseus, Helen and Orpheus as both classical and modernist characters.  As we engage with different texts and their respective heroes, we will focus on not only how the authors rethink “stories” or characters, but also how and why they rework genres, such as epic, lyric and drama.  We will consider, furthermore, how modernist film and opera engage classical characters and stories.This examination of how modernists read and revise ancient texts and literary structures will inform a sustained dedication to making you a better reader and reviser.  Bouncing between millennia on the hunt for ancient voices and modernist re-vocalizations, you will be developing your own voice through a number of in-class and take-home writing assignments.  In class, you will learn to read texts closely and analyze them critically.  With respect to your writing skills, you will master the basics of sentence structure, paragraph development and essay composition.  In the spirit of this course, you will write and revise, revise, revise your old work.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Jordan Greenwald“My words fly up, my thoughts remain below; words without thoughts never to heaven go.”-William Shakespeare, Hamlet (Spoken by Claudius, III, iii, 100-103)In this course, we will spend time reading plays, novels, and poems that either constitute or contain one (or both) of two speech acts: the curse and the supplication. We will think about the recurring trope of invoking “the gods” or “a higher power,” which runs through literary traditions from antiquity to modernity. We will consider the particular aesthetic qualities of tragedy, incantation, and benediction.As we will see, the lines between blessing and curse, malediction and prayer are not always as definite as we’d imagine, and this will provoke us to think about the consequences of answered prayer. In addition, we will want to think about why it is that the most abandoned, abject, and helpless literary figures are the most frequent to have recourse to discourses of invocation. To whom do they call out for help, and why? Who gets to pray to whom, and what counts as legitimate prayer? Finally, the works we encounter will prompt us to re-examine our definitions of the “sacred” and “profane,” particularly as those concepts relate to literary texts.This is a writing-intensive course, and we will explore all of these questions as a means of refining writing skills. Students will write and re-write a number of essays, and writing “workshops” will occur on a weekly basis. The final portion of the course will be spent on developing research skills, and will culminate in a research paper on one of the texts we have studied.

J. CaballeroThis course is a writing course first and a crash course in comparative and historical literary study second.  We will be focusing on process writing (as set out in Writing Analytically, our course’s textbook) and dividing the course in halves for both reading and writing purposes.In the first half of the course, we will work primarily through poetry to workshop the basic skills of literary study and of process writing, working over many weeks on a straightforward paper analyzing one work of poetry.  The literary reading load will be relatively low these weeks to accommodate more out-of-class, collaborative reading and writing exercises, and of course to allow time for reading the course’s hefty writing manual.In the second half of the course, mostly devoted to novels and short stories, we will work through the skills not only of prose stylistics and narrative study, but also of research methods for relating works across time periods, to their historical contexts and subtexts, or to changing cultural and individual ideologies.Poetry Unit will include (ALL included in a separate Poetry Reader):–          *Alonso de Ercilla (Spain) – La Araucana (epic – excerpts!)  1578–          *Esteban Echevarría (Arg) – La Cautiva (epic) 1837–          *Henry Longfellow (USA) – Song of Hiawatha (epic – excerpts!) 1855–          *Leopoldo Lugones (Arg) – Romances del Río Seco (lyric) 1938 (posthum)–          *Gloría Anzaldúa (USA) – Borderlands (lyric) 1987–          *Rosario Castellanos (Mex) – Selected Poems / Poesía no eres tu (lyric) 1969–          *Elizabeth Bishop (USA) – Questions of Travel; Geography III (lyric) 1965; 1976Possible works of the Narrative Unit may include (* = included in Excerpt Reader):–          James Fenimore Cooper (USA) – The Pioneers (novel) 1823 [0140390073]

R. LorenzThis course will explore the interplay of drama and tedium in day-to-day life. All of the works we will read eschew a purely heroic or marvelous mode and instead focus on petty concerns or mundane experience. But these texts do so in a way that is far from ordinary or boring; each offers a distinct creative perspective on everyday life. Some of the works we’ll read highlight the intense and dramatic undercurrents of routine existence. For example, Virginia Woolf “tunnels” deep into the inner life of a middle-aged woman who views each day as a “dangerous” feat; Nikolai Gogol turns a bureaucrat’s quest for a new coat in a darkly humorous, overblown farce; and Emily Dickinson, although she hardly left her room, wrote poetry suffused with extremes of despair, exultation, passion, faith and doubt. Other texts take the opposite approach, underlining the contrast between our romantic dreams and the monotony of daily experience. Euripides, for example, will show us how a heroic quest deteriorates into bickering and jealousy; Platonov, one of the most remarkable writers of the Soviet era, portrays the tragic failure of utopian hopes; and Chekhov’s plays offer masterful depictions of lassitude and gradually fading ambition. As we read each text, we’ll discuss how it illuminates the intertwined monotony and intensity of everyday experience, but we’ll also move beyond the course topic to read each text for its own sake, paying attention to multiple prominent themes and motifs. We will also devote substantial class time to instruction in argumentative writing and research skills. As in all R&C courses, you will write several papers. The ultimate goal of the course is to develop your critical thinking and writing skills as well as your ability to enjoy the creative complexity of literary texts.Texts:Platonov, The Foundation PitWoolf, Mrs. DallowayChekhov, The SeagullGogol, “The Overcoat”Dickinson, selected poetryEuripides, MedeaComp Lit R1B:14

Kanayo AgbodikeThis course will consider a number of literary texts with an eye to how they explore themes of pathology at both the individual and collective levels. Literature frequently involves critical reflections on both characters within texts and the social contexts that shape them: Plays and novels often imagine personal crises, as well as responses to disruptions within familiar or established public orders; lyric poetry can express conflicts between self and society. We will be considering these and other examples of how various literary forms explore the conditions and implications of pathology, or deviation from what is considered “normal” or “healthy.” Does literature tend to reinforce such norms, question them, or some combination of the two? What specific forms and techniques do texts involve in their representations of pathology? What do cultural reflections on pathology reveal about contradictions within systems of normative values and practices? These are some of the questions that will shape our discussion of a series of relevant texts.This is a writing-intensive course. In addition to active in-class participation, coursework will include frequent short writing assignments and two longer essays.

Jessica Crewe and Carli CutchinAs Leo Tolstoy famously opens in Anna Karenina: “All happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Beginning with Tolstoy’s premise, this course will explore the close intersection between fiction and the representation of (unhappy) family life. While many domestic texts conclude with an affirmation of the importance of family solidarity and security, we will focus instead on novels, plays, and films about unhappy families. What formal and stylistic methods do the writers of these texts use to engage reader sympathy for their characters? How do novelists and playwrights use the social institution of the family to express anxieties about industrialization, urbanization, and the Other? What models for (or warnings about) family life do these novels produce? And what possibilities do visual media such as the film or graphic novel offer to artists representing or reimagining the social conventions of the family?  We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

T. Wolff & J. GreenwaldThis course experiments with different approaches to close reading through the diversions and subversions of comedy. We will get used to treating the forms of wordplay that provide most jokes with their punchlines as corresponding to aspects of literary style, from ambiguity to anticlimax, from clashing registers to the much-maligned pun. We will also look for ways that the same slipperiness of meaning plays a role in our own everyday speech habits, and in the media that saturate our social formation and participation. The course theme is intended primarily to attune the undergraduate reader and writer to fine stylistic distinctions in literary texts, but also secondarily to reveal, and to offer descriptive terms for, the ways language plays games in our lives at large (a central topic throughout will be problems of translation and communication). For this reason we will read particularly with an eye out for the ways language and comedy structure and reconfigure broader social themes, from gender and sexual politics, to childhood and family psychology, to the establishment of cultural and legal norms. The course balances texts from a range of genres and media (including film, television and advertising) with critical texts that suggest the unexpected force of play and the “comic attitude” in and out of literature. As always, students should be aware that an R/C course is especially writing-intensive, but in this course an additional willingness to pause over, discuss and play with linguistic details is a must. Readings will be chosen from the following:Aristophanes, LysistrataWilliam Shakespeare, As You Like It, selected SonnetsHonoré de Balzac, “The Girl with the Golden Eye” or “Sarrasine”Emily Dickinson, selected poemsLewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland (& Through the Looking Glass, “The Hunting of the Snark”)Gerard Manly Hopkins, selected poemsEdward Lear, selected poemsOscar Wilde, The Importance of Being ErnestDonald Barthelme, selected storiesHarryette Mullen, Muse & DrudgeGeorges Perec, from Life: A User’s Manual (and further Oulipo excerpts)Marx Brothers, Duck Soupselected episodes of Arrested DevelopmentFriedrich Schiller, Letters on the Aesthetic Education of ManFriedrich Schlegel, from Athenaeum FragmentsJohan Huizinga, from Homo LudensSigmund Freud, from The Psychopathology of Everyday LifeD.

K. AgbodikeThe notion that racial identity is socially constructed is by now a widely familiar one. Yet race continues to exert a powerful influence over how society is structured and how we view ourselves and others. If race cannot be meaningfully described as having a “real” biological or objective existence, why and how does it persist in shaping our social, cultural, and political practices? What exactly do we mean when we refer to race as a “social construct?” In this course we will discuss these questions by way of talking and writing about a series of texts  that take on the topic of race from a number of contexts and perspectives. We will be focusing on the question of the role literature has played in both the formation and questioning of racial identities, as well as the concept of race itself. A comparison of ancient and modern literature will allow us to ask whether there have always been racial forms of identity or whether they are specific to the modern era. The class will also consider the paradoxical tendency of literature to construct and define racial identities at the same time that it criticizes them and explores their problematic nature. Though we will be focusing on the particular case of blackness as a racial identity associated with the African Diaspora, a consideration of other identities and their interrelations will allow for a more wide-ranging discussion.ReadingsHerodotus, The Histories (selections)William Shakespeare, OthelloMachado de Assis, Dom CasmurroHerman Mellville, Benito CerenoAime Cesaire, Notebook of a Return to the Native LandChester Himes, If He Hollers Let Him GoV.

How do our bodies experience and perform changes within and outside of ourselves? Are bodily performances representations or products of change? We will examine texts from the early and late classical periods and follow the theme of bodily and mental change reaching into the late 20th century. If, as Husserl argued, one must “get back to the things themselves, we will attempt instead to go forward to ourselves as things by considering the function of the body in marginalized literatures.

Layla Forrest-WhiteViolence is often seen as the opposite of speech. It is what happens when words fail, and communication can only occur through non-linguistic means.  In this course, I would like us to look more closely at this opposition by reading several violent works of literature. What is a violent word, and what is its relationship with physical violence? What is the word’s violence, and who is its target?The texts of this course are challenging in that they are often of a graphic nature, and, as I do not wish to offend anyone, I recommend that you keep your own preferences and comforts in mind when considering this course. That being said, I do not intend to treat this “heavy” topic too seriously all the time, as looking at it differently might help us come up with different ways to interact with violence, whether it be physical or verbal.READING LIST: Euripides, BacchaeShakespeare, Titus AndronicusMickey Spillane, Kiss Me DeadlyBrain Evanson, Dark PropertyJames Fenimore Cooper, The Last of the MohicansWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

We’ll start with folktales, cartoons and picaresque satires, move on to naturalist novels and other narrative critiques of social mores, and also examine relevant theory and criticism that raise larger questions about rogue discourses. Particular attention will be paid to the period of economic boom and bust in the first half of the twentieth century and its implications for more current concerns. Topics for discussion will include narrative representation, irony and point-of-view; social inequality and mobility; power and tactics of resistance; ideology, cynicism and false consciousness; and the ethics and politics of recognition and redistribution.Through regular written assignments and in-class discussion, we will also work on developing skills for writing and revising argumentative, analytical essays.

P. BritoThis class is about texts that want to take in entire worlds. It’s about stories, novels, and poems that aspire to the comprehensiveness of encyclopedias. This ambition gives them a strange, hybrid quality: the way that they catalog and communicate vast quantities of information often makes them seem more like non-literary texts than what we traditionally think of as literature. They will allow us to think about the often-complicated relationship between fiction and non-fiction, to consider the many ways in which texts connect both to the “real world” and to one another, and to reflect on what it means to read literature at a time when seemingly everything worth knowing is instantly available on the Internet.First and foremost, however, this is a writing course. It will be focused on the process of writing–on the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader. Texts will include:–The Collected Fictions of Jorge Luis Borges –Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace–The Rings of Saturn by W.G. Sebald–The Wasteland by T.S.

D. Inciarte & I. PopescuThe Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read sections from Raman Selden’s, A Reader’s Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory, which will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.Please buy the editions specifically ordered for this class.Course ReadingPlato, Symposium ISBN 0-14-044024-0Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel, selected chaps from Book 1 ISBN 0-14-044-047Cervantes, Don Quixote, 1st five chapters, 0-06-093434-4Nabokov, Pale Fire, 0-425-03784-3Shakespeare, As you Like It 0-451-52678-3Bernhard, Old Masters 0-226-04391-6Strunk & White, Elements of Style 0-205-31342-6 In reader: Selections from Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Franz Kafka, Donne, Lucretius, Clément Marot, James Joyce, Alice Munro, Shirley Jackson, Mary Oliver, Wislawa SzymborskaMovies: Dancer in the DarkCL R1B:

We’ll look at different ways of storytelling to determine how narratives are structured formally and linguistically. We will read literature as a political tool for the assertion of a marginalized identity, and to this end, question the use of multilingualism in the representation of multicultural communities. We will look at space as well – both the space of identity formation, and the space of communities living on the margins, separated by race, culture, ethnicity, language, and class. We will read literature from a wide variety of cultural and linguistic traditions, and our discussions will be informed by critical readings.This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, and two analytical research papers. Primary Texts will be chosen from the following:The Old TestamentErez Biton, “Summary of a Conversation” and “Shopping Song on Dizengoff”Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, DicteeJunot Diaz, DrownMichel de Montaigne, “On Cannibals”Vladimir Nabokov, “The Seaport”Emine Sevgi Ozdamar, Mother TongueCynthia Ozick, “Envy, or Yiddish in America”Henry Roth, Call It SleepLeila Sebbar, SherazadeCL R1A:8

Paul HaackeIn this class we will study works of fiction that revolve around rogues, tricksters, and outlaws, whether comic or tragic, sympathetic or monstrous. We will start with folktales, cartoons and picaresque stories, move on to novels, plays, films, and other narrative critiques of social mores, and also examine relevant theory and criticism that raise larger questions about rogue discourses. Particular attention will be paid to the period of economic boom and bust in the first half of the twentieth century and its implications for more current concerns. Topics for discussion will include narrative discourse, irony and point-of-view; social inequality and mobility; power, ideology, and tactics of resistance; cynicism and false consciousness; criminality and the law; and the ethics and politics of recognition and redistribution.Through regular written assignments and in-class discussion, we will also work on developing skills for writing and revising argumentative, analytical essays. Requirements will include prompt attendance and participation, short writing responses on bSpace, a midterm essay analyzing course materials closely, and a longer research paper or independent project.BooksLewis Hyde, Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth and Art (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux)

D. InciarteThe Roman poet Horace famously wrote that our stories should aim to instruct and delight. Through the centuries authors have interpreted his advice in many different ways. One important way is by linking the experience of literature to the experience of play.  This connection—between literature and play—will be the focus of our course. Among the questions we will ask: How do our authors play with language? How do they play with their readers? Are their playful creations simply fancy mind games, akin to chess, or are they serious philosophical inquiries that, in the words of Mary Poppins add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down?Students will improve their analytical reading and expository writing skills through close reading, theoretical and contextual discussions, and critical research. Along with works of fiction, we will read critical essays that will introduce students to some of the different ways critics have developed theoretical approaches to the discipline of literary studies. Requirements will include a three to four-page diagnostic essay; short free writing assignments; writing workshops; short critical group presentations; regular postings for online discussion; and two progressively longer essays, each of which will be revised. While we will practice the basic skills of writing argumentative essays, the focus of the longer essays will also be on incorporating and utilizing research in an essay.

Julia NelsenIn this course, we will read stories set primarily within the walls of various hotels. Situating our texts in the broader context of the travel narrative, we will first consider the relationship between hosts and guests, the traditional “inn,” and storytelling. We will then shift our focus to modern representations of the hotel and its rooms as unique sites of betweenness, mobility and transgression, alienation and anonymity, where the world is seen and experienced from an altered vantage point. Questions to be addressed include: how do hotels dramatize, emphasize or disrupt the distinction between public and private, personal and impersonal, domestic and commercial? What does it mean to “live” in a hotel? How does the hotel represent both an escape from and a desire for a place called “home”? What of the vacant hotel? Beyond typical overnight accommodations, we will also consider similar spaces that highlight the relationship between permanence and transience, solitude and community, the exotic and the ordinary. Finally, we will explore what it means to consider the literary text itself as a figure for hospitality.Readings may include:Homer, The Odyssey, selectionsGeoffrey Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, selectionsThomas Mann, Death in VeniceVirginia Woolf, The Voyage OutFerenc Karinthy, MetropoleAli Smith, Hotel WorldWayne Koestenbaum, Hotel Theory, selectionsSiegfried Kracauer, “The Hotel Lobby”Selected poetry by T.S.

Brian ClancyIn the opening section of his work Poetics, Aristotle moves from a brief discussion of means of representation to a focus on objects of representation that persists throughout his text. Although Aristotle’s theory of mimesis would be considered by many as a blueprint for fashioning narrative fiction through this focus on the objects and human actions that language allegedly refers to, this course examines how many 20th-century modernist literary projects appear at odds with Aristotle’s theory, while seeking to build narrative art on the basis of altogether new aesthetic premises. Moreover, the modernists viewed language as an aesthetic medium and oftentimes borrowed techniques from the visual arts in their exploration of narrative language’s many potential uses. This course thus seeks to fill the gap in narrative aesthetics set in motion by Aristotle’s theory of mimesis by studying the modernist literary techniques of the 1920’s that forever changed fiction despite the persistence of Aristotle’s ideas. As a way of critiquing Aristotle’s influential theory, this course grasps narrative language as an aesthetic medium in itself, not as a mode of representation that merely imitates action in the world. This course furthermore argues that narrative is not a host of symbols that stand for things we already know. In contrast, the epistemological function of narrative art (especially in the context of modernist literary experiments) is more complex and ambitious than often assumed. After looking at Aristotle’s Poetics, we will examine continental modernism to gain a better understanding of the actual materials of narrative art and their diverse functions. For example, we will examine the modernist literary experiments of authors like Joyce and Woolf through close reading, learning how to both decipher these authors’ literary techniques while constructing original arguments about the latter. We will look at how modernist literary experiments take place at the crossroads of experience, perception, and the formation of knowledge of the world. Modernist narrative language arguably creates the image of completely new matter in the texts under discussion through the construction of worlds unbound from plot and semantics. We also wish to examine how modernist literary techniques and effects differ from those used in painting, sculpture, music, dance, as well as other aesthetic mediums.

Brian ClancyWhat are the different binary oppositions that terms like representation and fiction tend to set up and how do different texts, and the novel in particular attempt to free our analytical thinking from oppositions like fiction vs. non-fiction and art vs. reality? How might we begin to understand the relationship between language and the world without seeing these respective spaces as being easily juxtaposed or spaces that are easily set apart? In this course, we wish to expand our understanding of the concept of fiction beyond the idea of stories about the world, plots with easily recognizable parts, as well as stories that make complete sense. How can we think about narrative beyond the idea of a story? In this course we will learn that the creative productions of fictional art are oftentimes quite vast in their scope while also seeing why it is difficult to set clear boundaries for what a literary text is about. We also hope to explore how literary form shifts dramatically over time. Beginning with texts in antiquity and the medieval period, this course will examine debates over concepts like mimesis, the transition from epic narrative into other literary forms, vernacular language, meta-narrative, and in particular the relationship between fictional language and the novel form, with an emphasis on novels written in the 20thcentury.Early in the course we hope to gain familiarity with different viewpoints on concepts like mimesis, plot, narrative temporality, verbal poetical structure, and the problem of referentiality. We will also examine throughout the course novelistic techniques such as characterization, narrative unreliability, and represented speech and thought. Here we will also consider the relationship between narrative and the representation of time, the relationship between fiction and epistemology, while examining historical shifts in the way in which the reader approaches narrative art epistemologically in the 20th century, with a particular focus later in the course on developments in the novel form during the 1920’s.Course texts:Aristotle, PoeticsMiguel de Cervantes, Don QuixoteJames Joyce, UlyssesVirginia Woolf, To the LighthouseVladimir Nabokov, LolitaFranz Kafka, The TrialComp Lit R1B:11

Kfir Cohen & Johnathan VakninIn this course we will develop writing and argumentative skills through exploring imaginative and theoretical texts that offer us models of alternatives worlds whose social structures attempt to solve some of the perennial problems of modern living. We will think through questions concerning the consequences of industrialization, gender relations, and the conditions needed to bring about a just society, among others. We will watch several contemporary films, and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on utopian fiction and sci-fi. We will consider some of the following questions: under what social conditions an “alternative world” becomes desirable? What do we mean by “world” and what might be its opposites? What role do literary form and genre have in constructing an alternative world? What kind of attitude do we adopt vis à vis such texts whose implicit or explicit aim is to be “more” than an imaginary experiment?Other than regular writing assignments, students will be asked to write a short piece elaborating an alternative world of their own.

S. BattisIn this course, we will look at representations of motherhood between two extremes: mythic and monstrous. If the mythic mother is defined by self-sacrifice and self-effacement, then the monstrous mother is the perversion of that ideal.  The monstrous mother sacrifices others for her own ends and to assert her own selfhood. We will focus primarily on the most extreme of monstrous mothers, the mother who purposely kills her children, in representations from various national literatures and traditions from Ancient Greece to the present. Is infanticide in literature to be understood as a metaphor for liberation or as freedom from the reproductive duties of the human female? Do these representations reflect individual pathologies or rather communal concerns for the welfare of children? Are we to understand, as Sigmund Freud does, that these kinds of stories represent the fulfillment of our repressed desires? What is the appeal of these stories?The mythological figure of Medea, who murders her children to get revenge on her husband Jason, will serve as a point of departure for our discussion. We will then read other representations, such as myths from the Greco-Roman tradition, fairy tales and episodes from the Bible. There will also be two novels, both of which discuss infanticide in America’s early history, and several films. Along with our fictional works, we will also study real-life cases of infanticide such as Susan Smith, Marybeth Tinning and Dena Schlosser. We will investigate how the media talks about these women and how the legal system penalizes them.Sections of Reading and Composition courses serve as introductions to literary analysis and as guides to the composition of well-argued, well-researched essays. This will be accomplished by class discussion, by breaking down essay-writing and research-doing into manageable components, and by extensive rewriting and smaller projects designed to help students understand the research process.

M. Bhaumik Democracy—a term used almost daily by the press, governments, law, social movements, and many poets—is not a new word but has a long history and multiple meanings. In particular, poets writing in different languages and epochs have been moved by the possibilities of the word and concept from ancient Athens to contemporary social movements. One of the central theses of the class is that poetry offers a critical reading about the politics of truth at play in everyday life. During a time of national crisis in 1870, for example, Walt Whitman writes about the “spirit” of democracy in a long poem entitled “Democratic Vistas.” The work appears as congressional debates on the rights of enslaved populations to vote and count as citizens emerge in the public sphere. In many respects, poetry puts forth the question about who has a voice and who counts as a citizen within nation-states. In this class, we will interpret mostly poetry but also some dramatic texts, novels, critical essays, songs, multi-media and protests using lyrics in order to ask: what is the relation between verse and democracy? How is the depiction of democracy in poetic verse distinct from the legal or governmental definitions? In order to analyze these questions in depth, we will not just focus on poetry written in English and in the United States but look at the lyric across cultures. Drawing from critical approaches to literary studies in a comparative versus a purely nationalist frame, we will then also consider what it means to read poems in translation. Does translation—a mode of moving a literary text from its original location to another—offer a distinct notion of understanding between differently positioned speakers that is crucial for democracy to flourish? Our class will concentrate on the specific form of the lyric and also musical forms closely linked poetic verse (the ballad, corrido, ghazal, and Rabindra Sangeet) in order to engage with the important question of how democracy is contradictory, difficult, ironic, mythological, satirical, and tragic, but also imagined and possible. The primary reading for the class will be a course reader including the writings of Mahmoud Darwish, Charlotte Delbo, Robert Haas, Emily Dickinson, Jose Marti, Gabriela Mistral, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Pablo Neruda, Percy Shelley, Rabindranath Tagore, W.B.

R. FalkoffThis course focuses on three figures that lurk at the fringes of late-capitalism and seem to represent at once the epitome, the inverse and even the undoing of its logics: the fetishist, the collector, and the hoarder. As we examine the material practices and psychic mechanisms that define these identities and authorize distinctions between them, we will consider the relationships between objects and texts and theorize the narrative implications of collecting, fetishism, and hoarding. Our study of the fetishist will begin with Freud’s writings about fetishism and fetishistic disavowal and the vast body of theoretical discourse they inspired.  We will then read Michel Tournier’s short story “The Fetishist,” and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s Venus in Furs. Gilles Deleuze’s analysis of Sacher-Masoch’s novel will help us to develop an understanding of fetishism as a signifying practice characterized by an essential ambivalence.The unit on collecting will begin with writings by Walter Benjamin that figure the collector both as an artist whose work is formed by detaching objects from their original functions and arranging them according to idiosyncratic criteria, and as an archaeologist, whose acquisitions stop up the flow of history, recuperating the fragmentary debris of its blind deluge. Moving from the collector to the hoarder, we will study the distinctions between collecting and accumulation set out in theoretical writings by Susan Stewart and Jean Baudrillard and in the memoir Collections of Nothing by William Davies King.The course will conclude with a consideration of the contemporary discourse of hoarding. We will ask why hoarding has garnered so much attention in the last decade, and why the discourse has come to be characterized by two analytic frameworks that are both contradictory and overlapping: on the one hand, hoarding is figured as both a symptom of and a product of the excesses of consumer culture, while on the other, it is understood as a response to material deprivation. The course aims less to uncover the truth of what causes hoarding (be it privation or plenitude), than to reveal the cultural anxieties the discourse expresses to trace its intersections with two literary precursors, the fetishist and the collector.Coursework will include readings and reading-responses, active participation in class discussions and frequent writing assignments and revisions. Regular attendance and participation is required. You will be encouraged to think critically about your own as well as others’ ideas, and you will learn how to express your interpretations in a coherent and cohesive way.

Jeffrey WeinerDescribing, performing, and creating ecstatic experiences has been one of the great stumbling blocks in literature.  Whether it is a physical or a spiritual elevation beyond the norm, the ability to articulate the transcendent has challenged writers in terms of the forms that can be used to express the ecstatic; this obstacle has also, debatably, given rise to a huge release of creativity and the rise of new forms.  We will explore the very limits of human experience in theatre, fiction, scripture, opera, and lyric poetry.  Euripides describes what will be the ongoing tension between freedom to experience aggressive and extremely pleasurable states with a need for the order and restraint of communal living.  From the time of the ancients to the present, individuals and societies have negotiated the restrictions on the experience of ecstatic states, and new cultural forms have come to fruition at that border.  We will explore the explosive collision of destructive and creative manifestations in texts through a variety of genres from different historical periods, and with the cross-disciplinary curiosity that defines Comparative Literature.Euripides, The BacchaeBible, selections from Gospels, Isaiah and Acts of the ApostlesApuleius, MetamorphosesJohn of the Cross, The Dark Night of the SoulShakespeare, The Winter’s TaleShelley, Mont Blanc Wagner, The Twilight of the GodsKushner, Angels in America: PerestroikaAristotle, short selections from Poetics and RhetoricBurke, Edmund, A philosophical enquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautifulCicero, short selections from On the Ideal OratorFreud, selections from Civilization and its DiscontentsHepburn,  “Wonder”James, short selections from Varieties of Religious ExperienceLonginus, On the SublimeMatthew Wilson Smith, selections from The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to CyberspacePlato, selections from Phaedrus____, selections from IonCL R1B:5

C. Piser & K. KadueIn this course we’ll study the connections between multilingualism, multiculturalism, and marginalized communities in literature. We’ll look at different ways of storytelling to determine how narratives are structured formally and linguistically. We will read literature as a political tool for the assertion of a marginalized identity, and to this end, question the use of multilingualism in the representation of multicultural communities. We will look at space as well – both the space of identity formation, and the space of communities living on the margins, separated by race, culture, ethnicity, language, and class. We will read literature from a wide variety of cultural and linguistic traditions, and our discussions will be informed by critical readings.Our goal this semester will be to learn how to read, write, and talk about literature; ultimately, we will write research papers that take our literary analysis a step further. Completing all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participating in class are key components of discussion courses, and you should be prepared to do both. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, and analytical and research papers. Primary Texts will be chosen from the following:The Old & New TestamentsHonoré de Balzac, “Sarrasine”Joachim du Bellay, Défense et illustration de la langue françaiseErez Biton, “Summary of a Conversation” and “Shopping Song on Dizengoff”Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, DicteeMichel de Montaigne, “On Cannibals”Vladimir Nabokov, “The Seaport”Emine Sevgi Ozdamar, Mother TongueRabelais, PantagruelHenry Roth, Call It SleepLeila Sebbar, Sherazade Critical Texts:Walter Benjamin, “The Task of the Translator”Jacques Derrida, “What is a ‘Relevant’ Translation?”Anne Donadey, “The Multilingual Strategies of Postcolonial Literature”Joshua L.

Sarah Ruth Lorenz This course will explore the interplay of drama and tedium in day-to-day life. All of the works we will read eschew a purely heroic or marvelous mode and instead focus on petty concerns or mundane experience. But these texts do so in a way that is far from ordinary or boring; each offers a distinct creative perspective on everyday life. Some of the works we’ll read highlight the intense and dramatic undercurrents of routine existence. For example, Virginia Woolf “tunnels” deep into the inner life of a middle-aged woman who views each day as a “dangerous” feat; Nikolai Gogol turns a bureaucrat’s quest for a new coat in a darkly humorous, overblown farce; and Emily Dickinson, although she hardly left her room, wrote poetry suffused with extremes of despair, exultation, passion, faith and doubt. Other texts take the opposite approach, underlining the contrast between our romantic dreams and the monotony of daily experience. Euripides, for example, will show us how a heroic quest deteriorates into bickering and jealousy; Platonov, one of the most remarkable writers of the Soviet era, portrays the tragic failure of utopian hopes; and Chekhov’s plays offer masterful depictions of lassitude and gradually fading ambition. As we read each text, we’ll discuss how it illuminates the intertwined monotony and intensity of everyday experience, but we’ll also move beyond the course topic to read each text for its own sake, paying attention to multiple prominent themes and motifs. We will also devote substantial class time to instruction in argumentative writing and research skills. As in all R&C courses, you will write several papers. The ultimate goal of the course is to develop your critical thinking and writing skills as well as your ability to enjoy the creative complexity of literary texts.Texts:Platonov, The Foundation PitWoolf, Mrs. DallowayChekhov, The SeagullGogol, “The Overcoat”Dickinson, selected poetryEuripides, MedeaWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

J.  CaballeroThis is a writing class, and our top priority will be the teaching of process writing, collaborative cultural analysis, and incorporating multiple kinds of feedback from different sources into your writing process. This entails frequent assignments ranging from reading quizzes, reading exercises, pre-writing exercises, editing exercises, and multiple drafts of multiple papers. For the purposes of a shared methodological framework and not falling asleep, we will work through a narrowly-defined corpus of cultural texts and theoretical texts to discuss topics relating to the subject of our readings. All assigned reading and writing must be completed in a timely manner to pass this class, much less to contribute substantially to the collaborative processes of in-class learning and out-of-class writing.The subject of this class in particular is what happens when [certain] people start being [too] polite and stop being [entirely] real: i.e., when identity and morality become unstable rubrics of action and perception. What do these fantasies teach us about the rest of us, who are only half-faking it? What impostures plague the nightmares of which historical periods and social constructs? This is not a class about psychopathology or even about the historical phenomena of crime or cruelty, but rather, about a cultural fantasy of “the psychopath” (complete with vicarious thrills and moral quagmires) and how useful that fantasy can be for analysis and discussion of all the historical and cultural norms to which they are drastic, all-too-individual exceptions: changing ideas of citizenship, sexual identity, masculinity, power, and civility.Central Texts will include:

Adeline Tran & Oya Erez“To look at a thing is not the same as seeing a thing.” – Oscar WildeTaking our cue from Wallace Stevens’ poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” we will be exploring how different ways of looking, seeing and observing are portrayed through narrative point of view in literature and film.  How does point of view shape, control and manipulate the narrative structure of a given text?  What is the difference between looking and seeing?  Is there a right and a wrong way of looking at something, or are there infinite ways of looking that are all equally valid? We’ve all heard the expression “I know it when I see it,” but is seeing the same thing as knowing?  Can the gaze be purely objective, or is it always (at least in part) subjective and biased?  In this course, we will take up these questions of the gaze through a comparison of various forms of narrative point of view, from the covert exchange of gazes in Princesse de Cleves, to the multiple shifts in perspective in To The Lighthouse, to the unreliable first-person narration in Lolita. In our discussion of narrative perspective in film, we will look at how point of view is presented visually through techniques such as camera shots, framing devices, and lighting.  Throughout the course, we will examine the relationship between ways of looking and ways of knowing, and ask ourselves whether seeing really is believing.  In addition, this class requires active student participation and places a strong emphasis on improving student writing skills through weekly worksheets, in-class workshops, and two formal papers.Required Texts:Madame de La Fayette, La Princesse de ClevesCaspary, LauraWoolf, To The LighthouseNabokov, LolitaSebald, AusterlitzFilms:Kurosawa, RashomonBergman, PersonaCL R1B:6

M. Cohen & R. CarbottiWhat if the Cold War became hot? What if John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry had succeeded?  What if the bomb under Hitler’s desk hadn’t missed? “What if” is the question that jump starts the imagination of children and scientists, writers and science fiction nerds, oppressed peoples and activists—everyone who thinks about making a different world possible. Science Fiction in general has sometimes been called “the literature of change”: take the world you know, imagine a possibly possible change, and chart the way from here to there. This course will zoom in on the hybrid child of science fiction and history: Alternate History. Alternate histories are science fiction that can take place in the past, the present or future, if only something in the “real world” had gone a little differently. We’ll look at examples from the hey-day of SF in 20th century US literature, but we’ll also explore older historical works and works from other literatures which ask the same question, “what if?”  Rather than escaping through a wormhole in search of sexy green aliens, we’ll investigate works in which “the literature of change” is concerned with this world: why are things the way they are? What’s gone wrong? And what are the political alternatives that might not be so fantastic, if we could only see the way from here to there?The major goal of this course is to develop and practice critical reading and writing skills for a broad range of analytical and research writing, with the alternate histories serving as rich, stimulating and hopefully fun material for our writing. Through workshops, revisions, and collaborative work we’ll improve our ability to read a text analytically, create interesting and meaningful arguments, and support those arguments through research. In addition to the works of fiction, we’ll read literary and historical essays both as writing models and to engage our readings with their ideas.Readings (and films) for the course may include: Alan Moore’s Watchmen, Terry Bisson’s Fire on the Mountain, Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle, stories by Jorge Luis Borges, the Coen Brothers’ “Inglorious Basterds” and Michael Chabon’s The Yiddish Policemen’s Union.CL R1B:7

S. SchneiderThis course will encourage critical reading, thinking and writing skills around the topic of the manipulation of space in literature, photography and film. We will read literary works and theoretical essays, and watch films that are particularly interested in how real and imaginative spaces can serve to frame stories, histories and ideologies and/or themselves become the protagonist. What laws govern real and imagined spaces? How do characters navigate them and according to what principles? What visible and invisible forces shape the worlds we encounter and how do we shape our thinking and argumentation, consciously or unconciously in relation to them? We will explore how spaces may reflect the encounters, experiences and memories that have transpired within them; we’ll also question how space can reflect time and history. Concurrently, we will ask how being aware of different kinds of space helps us to think differently about the world around us.Whether it be in a room, a city street, a house, a road or outer space, narratives are often carefully situated; critical arguments also require a considered framework and composition. Some questions we will address in order to think about writing styles are: How do imaginative narratives and critical arguments get their audiences on the same page? Do they also seek to distance them, and to what end? Through reading and class discussion, we will focus on how we frame our narratives and arguments. By engaging with works of literature, film and photography that make clear allusions to their mode and style of composition, we will consider the way we compose. Course ObjectivesThis is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper. We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper.BooksRoland Barthes, Camera Lucida (Hill and Wang, ISBN: 0374521344)Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities (Harvest Books, ISBN: 0156453800)Franz Kafka, Amerika (Schocken, ISBN: 0805210644)Tayeb Salih, Season of Migration to the North (New ISBN: 978-1-59017-302-2)Edwin A.

P. Haacke & C. GoldblattThis course will revolve around the arts of reading and re-reading, viewing and re-viewing, writing and re-writing. Focusing on selected works of literature and film, we will study a range of historical, theoretical and ideological questions related to the overarching topic of vision and revision, including verbal representations of images, literary representations of visual art, cinematic forms of narrative representation, and the relationships between spectacle and desire, difference and repetition, recognition and error, technology and reproduction, and history and fiction. In particular, we will attempt to understand how and why these works engage with problems of knowledge, memory and desire through metaphorical or literal representations of visual perception.Texts will likely be selected from among the following: BooksMarco Polo, “The Travels”

R. McGlazerThe label “frienemy” has only recently entered English-language popular culture and conversation, but figures combining characteristics of the ally with features of the foe are not at all new.  On the contrary, at least since Homer’s Iliad, literature has represented such figures and imagined the consequences of their hovering between friendship and enmity.  This course will introduce students to methods of critical reading, writing, and basic research through a wide-ranging investigation of “frienemies.”  Reading across genres (poems, plays, novels, stories, essays, and documentary and narrative films) and across historical periods, we will discuss relationships between classmates, comrades, combatants, and competitors.  We will traverse public and private realms as we work to make sense of political betrayals and celebrity back-stabbings as well as more mundane cases of rivalry, passive aggression, imaginary friendship, fashion victimage, unconditional love, everyday hate, and, especially, ambivalence.  Together we will ask what happens when those we have taken to be our friends turn out to be our enemies, and when those we have declared our enemies start to look like friends.  Throughout the course, we will also attend to the more general ethical and even political implications of such blurred distinctions, all the while thinking about what it might mean to conceive of our own readers as potential “frienemies,” generous but suspicious. In addition to reading texts by Homer, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Austen, Emerson, James, Beckett, Genet, and Morrison, and screening a number of recent films, we will consider selections from philosophical and critical works by Aristotle, Cicero, Nietzsche, Schmitt, and Weil, among others.Books:Jane Austen, Emma

Trinh LuuThis is a reading and composition course that will introduce a broad selection of texts on war and its aftermath. The readings will explore premodern Vietnamese civil war, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam wars, and the Algerian civil war. The wide selection is based on the assumption that there is something universally comprehensible about the experience of war. And yet, by reading these texts closely, we will try to tease out the social and cultural specificities that mark these different articulations. The course will address questions like: How can we talk about the legacy of war and survival ethically? What is its representability? How can we confront the horrors analytically? How do we speak of the war dead without “consuming” them?

J. Lillie & M. Renolds“Style is the thing that’s always a bit phony, and at the same time you cannot write without style.” (Elizabeth Bowen, The Death of the Heart). This course operates on the premise that style is more than a “phony” necessity; in fact, it can also be a means of self-discovery, self-invention, and a fair amount of fun-having. It’s all too easy not to pay attention to what characterizes one’s writing, to passively reproduce assembly-line structures and nutritionally worthless truisms. This course aspires to help us break free of that. By learning to recognize and interpret the styles of other writers, we’ll uncover and develop aspects of our own, and prove that analytical and creative writing are not two mutually exclusive categories. In accordance with that premise, in this course our enemies will be the bland and rote, our friends the idiosyncratic and experimental. Creative and complex arguments will be made fearlessly at the expense of always being right. Grammar rules will be discussed, admired, and from time to time, firmly stepped on. Clichés (especially those that tend to plague writing about literature) will be hunted and used for taxidermy. As you play with your writing through mimicry and invention (on paper) and by analyzing works through a variety of media (including in-class performances), we hope you’ll learn as much about your written voice as about the texts at hand.Works for the reading and viewing lists were selected for their provocativeness (to encourage valuable debate), for the extent to which they reward close reading, and for overall degree of fun and weirdness (always good indicators of a work that takes its style seriously). In addition to being written in unique (and sometimes notorious) styles, many incorporate style as a theme of the narrative itself, in which liberties and trappings of the written language play a crucial role.Possible Readings:• Sei Shonagon, selections from The Pillow Book• Kawabata Yasunari, some Palm-of-the-Hand Stories• Murakami Haruki, “On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning,” “The Elephant Vanishes,” “The Zoo Attack”• Project Itoh, Harmony• Eileen Chang, “Lust, Caution”• Raymond Carver, “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” “Cathedral”• Lydia Davis, The End of the Story or selections from Break It Down• Jenny Erpenbeck, Visitation• Alexander Pushkin, Eugene Onegin• Italo Calvino, If on a winter’s night a traveler• James Joyce, “The Dead”• Edgar Allan Poe, “Ligeia,” “The Man of the Crowd”• H.

P. ChatterjiThis is not a class about Facebook. However, we will think about how contemporary experiences of social networking can help us to describe relationships between individuals, social systems, and the connections between them. We will trace back some of these issues by reading books and watching films that predate contemporary social networks. Particular attention will be paid to the role of technology. In the works that we encounter, technologies of communication – the letter, the apartment building, the telephone, the computer – play a large role in our understanding of the content of the message, the purpose of communicating, the boundary between public and private, our notion of belonging in a community, and even our sense of self.This is a writing intensive course. We will spend considerable time in class on improving students’ writing skills by working on clarity, argument development and research basics. Students will participate in writing workshops and be asked to complete two papers, one of which will be a research project.

K. PalauCourse Description: From Columbus’ ‘discovery’ of the Americas to ongoing debates about immigration and labor, travel has played a significant role in Latin America’s story.  But what does it mean to travel? How does the experience of ‘taking a trip’ being ‘out of place,’ or encountering a ‘visitor’ have an impact on individuals, identities, and cultures?  How has Latin America been a site of travels in pursuit of personal roots and unchartered routes, but also a region touched by the unexpected ruptures that can emerge out of experiences of travel?In this course, we will take these questions as a point of departure for our own semester-long journey through a rich body of materials, visual and literary, all of which touch on the theme of travel in and from Latin America.  Beginning with Columbus’ Segunda Carta, we will consider how travel and cultural contact were seminal to the way Latin America came to be constructed historically.  But we will also examine a number of materials that explore the possibility for travel to break open and re-negotiate these kinds of constructed histories and identities.In our wanderings from descriptions of homecomings to touristy vacations, from journeys of ‘discovery’ to ethnographic missions, we will try to unpack the tensions inherent in questions of identity, movement, and the dynamics of cultural encounter that have played such an important role in shaping how the Latin American milieu has been both lived and imagined.Course prerequisite: This is an intensive writing course that fulfills the second half of the University Reading & Composition (R&C) requirement and is designed to help you continue to refine skills taught in an R1A course. We will build on the skills taught in R1A and dedicate ample time to crafting our critical thinking and essay-writing skills, giving special attention to argumentation, analysis, and the basics of how to put together a strong and convincing academic paper.  We assume that you have completed R1A or the equivalent at another institution and that you come ready to write longer, more complex papers and engage more difficult texts than those assigned in R1A.Language prerequisite: This is also a bilingual course designed to increase your language skills and familiarity with cultural production in Spanish.  Writing assignments will be in English, but we will read texts in the original and regularly conduct class discussions in Spanish. Students must have completed one of the following prerequisites: AP High School Spanish, score of 3 or higher on the AP Spanish exam, Spanish 4 or 25, or be a native Spanish speaker with adequate skills for the class.  A language exam will be given the first day of class.Writing Assignments: One four-page diagnostic essayOne six-page paper (with rewrite)One ten-page research paper (proceeded by outline & draft)Frequent short writing assignments on thesis statement, close textual analysis, outlining, etc.Possible Primary Readings and Viewings: (Please do not purchase books until after the first class session.

Oya Erez “I don’t know which of us has written this page.”
-Jorge Luis Borges, “Borges and I”Artists’ personas, alter egos, doppelgängers, shadows and evil twins are some of the literary doubles we encounter in this course. Our characters will turn out to be obsessed with mirrors, echoes, not getting old, cheating death, figuring out if they are real or fake, better or worse, and – not surprisingly – with their doubles. As we go from Babylonia in 2000 B.C. to Los Angeles in the new millennium, we will see that these kinds of relationships have been an ongoing subject of fascination for writers and filmmakers. We will try to understand what it is about being around someone so much like oneself that can bring out both the most profound and the most disturbing elements in one’s character. We will also ask what these relationships can tell us about the relationship between writer and reader, filmmaker and viewer, narrator and subject.This is a writing-intensive course that builds on the skills you have gained in the first of the Reading and Composition sequence. In this course, you will use your critical reflections on the text as starting point for developing two papers, the latter of which will incorporate research on literary criticism. You will develop your papers through the course of the semester by means of a series of brainstorming assignments, draft outlines, in-class workshops, peer edits and revisions. In addition to the two longer papers, you will also complete shorter weekly reading responses and additional assignments devoted to specific elements of essay writing.WorksThe Epic of Gilgamesh

																	CCN:  17356In this course we will study medieval and early-modern manuscripts as complex intersections of materiality, aesthetics, politics, and institutionality. In a first part, students will be introduced into the fundamentals of codicology, paleography, and manuscript illumination: a hands-on phase for which we will use real manuscripts from Berkeley’s Bancroft Library. In addition, we will discuss some seminal critical work on the cultural dynamics of manuscripts. After this introductory part, our class will explore selected cases and genres such as medieval bibles, books of hours, poetic anthologies, and manuscripts with scientific texts. In the third part of the course, students will pursue their own research in collaboration with the instructors.

																	COMP LIT R1B.12Point of View: Critical Thinking through FictionTuTh 4-5:30pm205 DwinelleGSIs: Maya Kronfeld       mayak@berkeley.eduActive class participation is expected of all members of this class. This will be a discussion-oriented course, and you are expected to engage actively in our conversations, bearing in mind that class participation can take many forms, both in and beyond the classroom. Active listening, critical thinking, and careful note-taking are all productive forms of engagement during class, as are lively involvement in small-group work and thoughtful completion of in-class assignments. Careful reading and reflection on homework assignments and discussion in office hours are valuable forms of engagement outside of class hours. Get in the habit of marking up your texts with notes while you are reading– we will discuss more about what this means in class!One of our primary goals in this course is to become better critical readers. This requires a close engagement with the text, at the level of its content, language, and style. You are therefore expected to come to class having carefully read and reflected on the material for that day. This often means formulating questions, rather than answers. You will frequently be asked to come to class ready with a question about the text that you would like to pose to the rest of the class. Please bring all assigned texts for each day’s discussion to class with you.I will hold two hours of office hours per week, at a time TBA. If you have class during my office hours, you are free to e-mail me to make appointments for another time. Some of the best writing coaching can happen on a one-on-one basis, and you are strongly encouraged to use this opportunity to work on your writing, or to discuss aspects of the texts that we did not get a chance to cover in class.  Office hours meetings are especially helpful before you actually start writing a paper. One office hours meeting will be mandatory towards the beginning of the semester, to discuss your diagnostic essay.This is a writing intensive course. We will frequently devote class time to writing workshop sessions, in which we will discuss the various aspects of an interesting and persuasive analytical paper on a literary text, basic research skills, and the mechanics of writing. You will be responsible for writing a diagnostic paper (two to three pages), a first and final draft of a mid-term paper (five to six pages), and a final research paper (eight to nine page first draft, nine to ten page final draft). All assignments should be stapled, typed in Times New Roman, 12 pt font and double-spaced. First drafts will be marked with the grade they would have received had they been a final assignment, but only the grade on your final version will count towards your overall course grade. First drafts should be complete papers and should show the same level of thought and engagement that you would put into a graded final version. Failure to submit a first draft will result in a failing grade on the final version of the paper. We will spend considerable time revising paper drafts, and I expect to see significant improvement from first to final draft, not only at the level of writing but also at the level of ideas. Failure to adequately revise your paper will result in the final version receiving a lower grade than the provisional grade given for In addition to the graded papers, you will be expected to complete periodic short creative and
analytical writing assignments, both in and out of class. These are intended to improve the quality of our class discussion and your longer papers by encouraging careful critical thinking about our readings through less formal written engagement with the reading. Failure to complete these assignments thoughtfully will be reflected in your participation and homework grades.**The final research essay is due May 11th, 4:00PM in 4416 Dwinelle**In-class Close Reading presentationsStudents will be responsible for two collaborative in-class presentations:  Presentations will be short and informal (5-10 min each) and will be done with a partner. You will walk the class through your close reading of a (very) short passage from our literary text for that day.  You are expected to attend class regularly and on time. Every unexcused absence will result in a drop of one-third of a letter grade (e.g. from an A- to a B+) from your participation grade. Two unexcused tardies will count as one unexcused absence, and your grade will be adjusted accordingly. Your absence will be considered unexcused unless you notify me by email or in
person in advance of class. Only two absences with advance notification will be excused; any further absences will be considered unexcused unless accompanied by a doctor’s note.Attendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes. Roll will be taken every day during this period, for both regular and waitlisted students. Anyone who does not attend all classes during the first two weeks will be dropped from the class. At the end of the first and second week of classes, students will be added manually from the waitlist. If you are attempting to add this class and did not attend the first day, you will be expected to attend all class meetings thereafter and, if space permits, you will be allowed to enroll. No students will be added after the end of the second week of the term without permission from the Department. Students can only be added through the wait list.Homework (short writing assignments, presentations): 20%
Papers must be turned in at the beginning of class on the day on which they are due. For every calendar day that a paper is late, the final paper grade will be dropped by one-third of a letter grade, unless you’ve been granted a prior extension. This policy applies to both first and final drafts. If you will have to turn a paper in late because of extenuating circumstances, you must request permission at least 48 hours before the paper is due. The same rules regarding paper If you would like to continue improving a paper following the “final” draft, you are allowed to revise and resubmit all work but the final paper. You are strongly encouraged to consult with us before beginning to rewrite a paper, both to develop a plan for revision and to determine whether
it would instead be more beneficial to devote the time you would spend rewriting to your next paper. We will accept rewrites only on papers that have already shown significant revision and improvement from the first to final draft; if you do not engage substantially with the first round of required revision, you will not be allowed to resubmit the paper. Similarly, I will not accept
rewrites that reflect only cosmetic changes and do not show a serious revision and reworking of ideas. Rewrites are due within one week of receiving our comments and grade on the final draft of the paper. Please note that choosing to rewrite a paper does not guarantee that your grade will increase; the improvement must be significant enough to merit a higher grade.This is a discussion-based class, and its success will depend on the participation of each class member. In addition to being an active participant in our conversations, whether by introducing your own ideas, responding to a classmate’s comments, posing questions, or actively listening, you have the responsibility to engage respectfully with the ideas of your classmates and to help
create an atmosphere of friendly but rigorous critical engagement. Cell phones and laptops are not allowed in class. Your participation grade will be lowered by one-third of a letter grade every time we see you use your cell phone in class.“Plagiarism is defined as the use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example:

T. Warner & Mandy CohenFrom the Tower of Babel through contemporary narratives of immigration, exile, and displacement, linguistic confusion is a venerable motif. So what is a reader to make of a story that “stops making sense?” In this course we will read and discuss many varieties of linguistic confusion. These will include multilingual texts that address multiple audiences, as well as works that mix sacred, profane, and even dead languages. Some of our readings will frustrate interpretation with secret codes while others will tantalize with open secrets. We will also discuss mixed media works that employ several genres. By considering novels, plays, films, poems and comics that refuse to be transparent in their communication, we will take linguistic confusion not as a problem to be solved but as a strategy that can be productive and provocative. This being a 1B course, the focus will be as much on writing as on reading. Our hope is that the confusion we confront in our readings will help us develop valuable analytical tools in class discussion and hone our ability to write subtly, critically, and insightfully.Readings may include:

Selected students will be notified and enrolled.This poetry workshop is designed for students who would like to become better readers and writers of poetry, regardless of their experience. The writing component will encourage each writer to develop and pursue their own project. The reading component will help us explore two key questions in the history of modern poetry, stimulating each writer to discover what it means for them to write poetry in the here and now. First, by reading poetry across a variety of language traditions and historical contexts, we will be asking what makes a poetic text powerful as a voice-giving medium that faces current events. Second, by looking into how other discourses and areas of knowledge have given rise to various poetic “experiments” (such as philosophy, science, AI), we will think critically about the value of “newness” in our work.Requirements will include critical responses on assigned readings, weekly writing prompts, in-class workshops, critique of each other’s writing, a final project and a final performance.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Reading assignments and writing experiments will generate materials for the workshop and build the tools to develop a writing practice and language. Each week students will compose poems in response to writing exercises that I provide and that the class develops together. In addition, students are required to write critical responses to assigned readings, keep a reading journal, comment on each other’s writing, attend readings, and memorize their own poems for recitation. For the final project, students will make a chapbook containing revised poems and a poetic statement.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	This course will consider the contemporary and queer fate of three Greek tragedies, Sophocles’ Oedipus, the King and Antigone, and Euripides’, The Bacchae. In our readings, we will pay attention to how “tragic” consequences take place when the actions of characters deviate from kinship norms or when kinship relations are not recognized. We will consider as well how queer rewritings of tragic scenes seek to generate alternative ways of thinking about non-normative kinship.  Are all forms of non-normative kinship tragic? What are the conditions under which we come to recognize new forms of kinship that do not lead only to tragic consequences?  The course will pair Greek tragedies with writings, films, and plays by James Baldwin, Colm Toibin, James Baldwin, Tony Kushner, Alison Bechdel, Monique Wittig, and Octavia Butler, among others. We will also read some theoretical essays on tragedy and queer kinship, including texts from anthropology, feminist philosophy and psychoanalysis, and consider contemporary films that replay – and rework – key themes of tragic kinship and queer life.Requirements:  Students will be required to submit three short papers ( one paper of 3 pages, and two papers 4-5 pages in length) and one longer paper (9-10 pages), to attend class regularly, and to contribute to class discussion. Prompts will be provided for all four papers.  There will be no final exam.Schedule:Week I and II:  Introduction to tragedy, kinship, queer theory.Reading: Sophocles’ Oedipus RexSecondary readings:  selections from anthropologists Claude-Levi-Strauss, Gayle Rubin, and literary theorists Lee Edelman, Eve Sedgwick, selections from Sigmund FreudWeek III: Modern Retellings of Oedipus:  Colm Toibin, Mothers and Sons; James Baldwin “Sonny’s Blues”Week IV- V: Rageful Daughters, Stubborn Laws:  Sophocles’s AntigoneCritical Readings:  Jennifer Wallace, The Cambridge Introduction to Tragedy (Fate, Politics, Gender)Week VI: Reimagining the Future through the Past, Octavia Butler, Kindred, Critical readings from Donna Haraway, Elisabeth Freeman on queer temporalityWeek VII:  Murderous Impulse and its Alternatives:  Euripides’ The BacchaeWeek VIII: More Murderous Impulse and its Alternatives: Monique Wittig, Les GuérillèresWeek IX:  New Kinship, Survival, and Tragedy: Tony Kushner “Angels in America” (film)Week X:   Rewriting Kinship and Belonging: two films: Panos Koutras, “Strella” and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, “A Kid with a Bike”Week XI: Tragi-Comedy: Alison Bechdel, Fun HomeWeek XII: Readings in New Queer Kinship, including Sarah Franklin, Peter Wade, Jose MunozWeek XIII: Queer stories and Tragic Endings?

																	How are we to understand “East” and “West” as objects of study, as discursive constructs that have apparently congealed into self-evident geographical realities?We will study this dilemma in two ways:(a) as a theoretical problem, starting with the problem of crosscultural comparison, before examining the history of East/West literary studies beginning with the birth of comparative philology and linguistics in the late 18th century and ending with more recent polemics on world literature in the wake of Edward Said, Fredric Jameson, and world-systems theoryand(b) as a literary-historical problem, by examining three distinct moments in East-West literary relations: the eighteenth century, which we shall explore through the genre of European and Near Eastern travel narratives; the nineteenth century, in the context of the translation and adaptation of “oriental” texts and genres by European authors and the parallel adaptation of the European novel in the non-West; and the twentieth-century in the context of modernist (American and Russian) orientalisms as well as Asian anti-imperialist nationalisms.Authors to be read will likely include Montesquieu, Sir William Jones, Friedrich Schlegel, Goethe, Kalidasa, Hafez, Tolstoi, Muhammad Tahir al-Qarakhi, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Ezra Pound, Velimir Khlebnikov, Mulkraj Anand and Raja Rao.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this course we explore theories and practices of gender and race through physical performances in interdisciplinary art works, which include theatre, dance, performance art, film, animation, and music in live and mediated forms. We will focus on how race and gender stereotypes shift, resist, and radicalize in art works, which travel outside national borders and encounter “other” bodies. Whose body is this in these aesthetic and popular representations? Who is making up the rules for our bodies? Whose body dares disrupt an authoritarian national image? Whose body plays by the rules and subverts the regime of censored gender and racial performance acts? The course will include critical analysis of performance and media, participation in performance/media experiments, and attendance at several performance/media events.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Why do people write long novels, and why do people read them? We will look for answers in three different places: in George Eliot’s Middlemarch, in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Idiot, and in selections from Marcel Proust’s seven-volume novel In Search of Lost Time. Eliot and Dostoevsky had different ambitions as novelists. Middlemarch and The Idiot were written around the same time, but they come from different traditions (English and Russian) and have astonishingly different aims. Our goal will be to figure out what Eliot and Dostoevsky were using novel-writing to do, and why their undertakings required such length. Proust loved the novels of Eliot and Dostoevsky. He named The Idiot the most beautiful novel he ever read. When he wrote his own novel, he outdid both Eliot and Dostoevsky in length. We will only be able to read selections from his seven-volume novel within the confines of this course, but we will read enough to see how he took the ambitions of earlier novelists like Eliot and Dostoevsky and went in new directions with them. There are reasons why novels are long, but, as we will discover, they aren’t always the same reasons. For these three writers, but in very different ways, a novel becomes an instrument for studying and for experiencing what it means to exist in the world and in time. The three novels we will be reading are now thought of as among the most inventive, challenging, and influential ones ever written. By the end of the semester, we should be experienced enough readers to ask why reading long novels is important and how it can help make different aspects of the world we live in intelligible to us. We should be well equipped to judge how this kind of immersive reading experience can transform our ability to see the world around us.Books:Fyodor Dostoevsky, The IdiotGeorge Eliot, MiddlemarchMarcel Proust, Swann’s Way, In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, The Guermantes Way (excerpts)We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

We will look at the complexities of narration in fiction and film by first asking how we define the nature of truth and reality. Is truth an objective viewpoint on our world or a set of subjective interpretations? What role does lying play in society, and how would the perspective of a biased or deceptive narrator problematize our interpretation of a text or film? And what happens to us, the readers, once we suspect the narrator to be “unreliable”? How does this heighten our attention, affect our perception of truth and reality, and possibly introduce us into a mode of critical thinking?This course is designed to develop the skills obtained in Reading and Composition 1A. In this course, you will learn how to write comparative, research-based literary analysis. To this end, we will work on interpreting literature, producing close readings, developing solid literary arguments, understanding literary theory, doing and presenting outside research, and analyzing and critiquing theoretical work in class discussions and writing assignments. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, one short diagnostic essay and two longer analytical research papers.Required ReadingAlbert Camus, The Stranger

Vladimir Nabokov, LolitaAdditional reading material will be posted on bCourses.PapersThere will be three papers for this class. The first is a short diagnostic essay due at the end of the first week of class in which you will demonstrate your analytic and composition skills. It is only worth 5% of your grade, but please do your best on this; the purpose of this assignment is for us to see what elements of writing and analysis we should focus on this semester, as our instruction will be
tailored to students’ needs.  All papers must have an argumentative thesis supported by evidence from the text in the form of close readings. You will write rough drafts for papers 2 and 3. Late papers will not be accepted; if you need an extension, you must let us know well in advance. This class moves very quickly, and it is in your best interest to turn in all work on time.Papers should also adhere to correct format and citation procedures we will discuss in class.  In your reader, you will find a grading rubric so that you know what we are looking for; we do not believe that grades should be a mystery. All drafts should be turned in with prior drafts, outlines, peer editing work, etc. attached.AttendanceAttendance is required. After the first two weeks of classes, you are allowed two unexcused absences. If you are sick or have an emergency, you must email us before the class you will miss. You are responsible for turning in all assignments on time and for all material covered in class, whether or not you are in attendance. Additional absences will affect your participation grade. If you are sick
but already have two unexcused absences, or are sick for the second time, you will need a doctor’s note (such as an appointment confirmation from the Tang Center’s Urgent Care) for the absence to be excused.You should come to class on time (class starts promptly at 9:40am). We will be covering a lot of material, and your attendance and participation are essential to the academic environment. Arriving late is disruptive; if you are late more than twice in the semester, your grade will be affected. If you must leave early, please notify us before class begins.ParticipationThis class is based on active, engaged discussion. This means that you must be in attendance, awake, and prepared to participate. You should have your book and any additional materials (reader, articles, short assignments). Coming to class without your book is unacceptable. Your participation grade is based on these elements, as well as on your level of contribution to class and small group
discussion. If you don’t like to speak up in class, see us to make alternative arrangements. Part of any discussion is listening; please help us to create a receptive, comfortable environment. We encourage you to agree or disagree with your classmates, but please do so in a respectful manner.
Food, Drink, and ElectronicsFeel free to bring water, coffee, etc. Do not eat in class. Please do not bring your laptop or iPad to class. Turn cell phones off. Do not send text messages during class.HomeworkYou will have two types of homework: reading and writing. Reading should be done pen in hand; you should underline and take notes. Sometimes we will give you questions to guide your reading or ask you to pick passages to focus on. But in general, read carefully and with attention to detail. Note recurring elements, apparent themes, interesting details, or anything that seems difficult.  Come to class prepared with questions and comments on the reading.  In addition to the close readings and papers listed on the syllabus, you will have frequent short assignments and pre-writing work. Written work is due at the beginning of class on the day it is listed on the syllabus (or, if specified, by email). Late work will not be accepted without our prior consent. All work, without exception, should be typed and proofread.Group PresentationsOn the second day of class, you will sign up to give one 15-minute group presentation on one of the texts we will be reading. Each group must meet on their own to prepare, and has the option of meeting with us as well. The presentations should focus on the historical background of the novel—the author, the time period, the country, etc. Each presentation should have a written
component (like a handout), an interactive component (discussion questions, a game), a visual aid (poster, Powerpoint presentation), and a properly formatted bibliography to be turned in at the end of the presentation. Each member will have an opportunity to report back on his or her individual experience. You will be graded as a group.Grade BreakdownAttendance and Participation 25% Paper 1 5%
Group Presentation 10% Paper 2 20%
Short Assignments 15% Paper 3 25%Office Hours and Email Communication  Please come to our office hours! The point of this course is to improve your writing and reading skills, and often students will need extra help. If you come for help with a paper, please come to the meeting prepared, with specific questions and some good thinking already underway. Believe us: coming to office hours helps your writing and, subsequently, your grade in the course. It is also a good opportunity to have one-on-one instruction at a large university.If you can’t make our office hours, email us to find a time that works for us both. You are also welcome to send us academic questions via email, but please do not send paper drafts. When emailing, please write, spell, and punctuate accordingly!SLC TutoringWhile we will spend a lot of time working on writing in class and during office hours, we can’t cover everything. We recommend that students who need more help with writing mechanics use the Student Learning Center in the Golden Bear Building on Sproul Plaza. A range of tutoring options is available, including drop-in tutoring for help with a single assignment and individual tutors who will work with you for the entire semester. R&C students have first priority, but for a dedicated tutor, be sure to make arrangements during the first week of classes. For more information, go to: http://slc.berkeley.edu/bCoursesPlease create a bCourses account for yourself after the first day of class: https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/. We will use bCourses to post announcements, assignments, and additional course materials. You are responsible for keeping up with our bCourses course site.PlagiarismThe University has a strict policy on plagiarism: “Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example: Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without acknowledgment.
 Use of the views, opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment.

																	The topic of obsession, primarily in the context of [romantic] love, is extremely prevalent in literature, film, and popular culture. Authors and artists of various modes, genres, and historical periods often utilize the idea of obsession in order to produce works that are both aesthetically affective and, in some senses, universally interesting and relatable. In this class, we will be engaging with texts that grapple with the complexities of obsession, from “ordinary” unrequited love to murderous jealousy and rage. What is the relationship between obsessive love and artistic creation? What is it about the topic of obsession that allows an interesting and engaging narrative to unfold? This class will explore these and similar questions, drawing on works by (among others) Nabokov, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, and Alfred Hitchcock.Books for purchase:Leo Tolstoy, The Kreutzer Sonata

We will read texts that take up the questions of artificial intelligence and human attachment (Ex-Machina), the relation between justice and techniques of scientific prediction (Foundation, Minority Report), and time travel (The Time Machine) among others.  We will watch several contemporary films and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on sci-fi and utopian/distopian fiction. The following questions will underlie a few of our discussions: can humans attach to inanimate machines and if so what do such attachments teach us about relationships with humans? Why are we both fascinated and deeply anxious about the possibility of artificial intelligence such as cyborgs and robots?  Why do science and scientific innovation are used as models to imagine perfect societies and why such models usually fail?

																	This course examines a series of films, beginning in the silent era and working towards the present day, to consider how cinema represents its own relationship to technology and industry. At its most fundamental level, the course will ask how the films on our syllabus engage with a variety of modern machines, ranging from factory apparatuses and cars to robots and spacecraft, and including the movie camera itself. We will explore how these machines are, by turns, represented as horrifyingly impersonal, thrillingly powerful, improbably beautiful, and movingly human.Our primary mode of investigation will be formal analysis of the films themselves. However, the course will also cultivate students’ awareness of the material conditions of cinematic production, both the specific technological devices and the particular economic structures that make each film possible. We will ask not only how cinema portrays machines, but also how it engages with its own uniquely mechanical form; not only how films represent industrial landscapes, but also how analyses of mass production might offer valuable insight into the industry of cinema itself.Required viewing:Charlie Chaplin, Modern Times (USA, 1936)Dziga Vertov, Man with a Movie Camera (USSR, 1929)Sergei Eisenstein, Strike (USSR, 1925)Fritz Lang, Metropolis (Germany, 1927)Michelangelo Antonioni, Red Desert (Italy, 1964)Charles Burnett, Killer of Sheep (USA, 1978)Jia Zhang Ke, Still Life (China, 2006)Jennifer Baichwal, Manufactured Landscapes (Canada/China/Bangladesh, 2006)Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt (France, 1963)William Friedkin, To Live and Die in L.A.

																	This senior seminar will offer students an introductory overview, as well as in-depth engagement with, the work in aesthetics, literary theory, and criticism developed by the Frankfurt School.  “The Frankfurt School” was the term eventually coined to identify a core group of intellectuals working in and around the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung), founded in 1923 and affiliated to this day (except for its exile during and in the immediate aftermath of the National Socialist/Nazi regime) with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt. The Institute’s founders sought to develop new methodologies, which they called “critical theory,” combining theoretical and empirical approaches to explore the unprecedented complexities, difficulties, and suffering engendered by modern, industrial-capitalist society and the often authoritarian political responses to it. In time, their work also took up the new global dispensations that followed World War II. With regard to Left responses to modernity, the Frankfurt School sought to develop alternatives to what they saw as the determinist rigidities of orthodox versions of Marxian theory, whether Social Democratic or Leninist. As members of the Frankfurt School themselves often acknowledged, many of the fundamental concepts underlying critique had already emerged in recognizably modern form in the work of eighteenth and nineteenth-century figures like Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and others. In addition, twentieth-century contributions to critical thinking by Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Georg Lukács, among others, would prove crucial for the Frankfurt School.The members of the Frankfurt School tended to think of critical theory as an effort to understand the social organization of economics, politics, culture and the arts—and, indeed, of everyday life—in order to establish the grounds from which existing social dispensations and their values could be grasped and questioned, and from which alternative social practices and formations could be projected. Critique, they thought, was thus central to the democratic processes by which we assess a given sociopolitical formation’s legitimacy, viability, and efficacy. Critique also animates contemporary democratic notions of dissent, freedom of expression, and political participation, in which various values and norms are challenged, reformulated, and justified publicly through reflective analysis and open debate. Critique likewise helps us analyze, articulate, and contest the ways in which cultural, artistic, and aesthetic activities and institutions relate to the economic and political spheres.There have to date been at least three–and today, we are perhaps amid the flourishing of a fourth–“generation” of Frankfurt-School philosophers, theorists, critics, and thinkers. While each generation has paid important attention to the role that aesthetic and imaginative activity play in critical thought, it is arguably the Frankfurt School’s “first generation” that developed the most sustained and influential arguments for the importance of art and culture to critical agency. While this seminar will briefly discuss the Frankfurt School’s later generations, it will emphasize the foundational work of the first generation.  We’ll read theory and criticism focused on the critical value of literature, the other arts, and culture by a number of those first-generation figures, including  Max Horkeimer, Herbert Marcuse, and Leo Löwenthal.  But throughout the semester, we’ll emphasize the work of two figures whose work on literature and the other arts has proved decisive in both critical-theory circles, and, more generally, within literary, art, aesthetics, and cultural criticism themselves: Theodor W. Adorno, and his close friend–who was significantly associated with, though not formally a member of, the Frankfurt School–Walter Benjamin.The seminar’s first few weeks will involve a double-track focus. While reading Martin Jay’s The Dialectical Imagination: : A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923-1950, we’ll simultaneously read and discuss selected texts by three eighteenth and nineteenth-century philosophers whose thought provided points of departure for Frankfurt critical theory: Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, and Karl Marx.  Through the rest of the seminar, we’ll then read selections of key Frankfurt works, focusing on Adorno and Benjamin while considering other Frankfurt authors as well.  We’ll also read short texts and excerpts from the fiction, poetry, drama, and criticism–and perhaps, time permitting, we’ll work with some music and cinema–by a number of artists important in Frankfurt critical writing, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Proust, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, Stevens, various Surrealists writers, Beckett, Celan, Schönberg, Webern, Boulez, Chaplin, Eisenstein, and others.Among the key questions and issues we’ll see Frankfurt aesthetics, literary theory, criticism, and cultural analysis taking up in relation to the making and experiencing of art will be these:  Does art offer us a kind of knowledge, and what status does such knowledge–often termed “subjective”–have vis-à-vis “rational,” science-oriented, “objective” or “conceptual” knowledge? How might this matter of knowledge relate to different kinds of value, or different processes of valuation and judgment, in modernity (aesthetic, artistic, cultural, political, economic)?  How do the mechanical or technological emphases of modern economic and cultural production interact with aesthetic “subjectivity”?  How should we grasp the relations of mass or popular culture, with what were once called–and sometimes still are referred to as–the “fine” or “high” arts? Finally, what can all this tell us about whether art, aesthetics, and criticism are–or should be–ethically and sociopolitically “committed” or “engaged,” aiming to contribute to the consciousness and activism of classes and groups who’ve historically experienced oppression and exploitation?Required books:–Walter Benjamin, Illuminations (Schocken, 1968); paper; latest edition; ISBN: 0-8052-0241-2.–Walter Benjamin,  Reflections (Schocken, 1978); paper; latest edition; ISBN: 0-8052-0802-X.

																	“Sexuality brings into play too great a diversity of conjugated becomings; these are like n sexes, an entire war machine through which love passes.”– A Thousand Plateaus.This freshman seminar will offer students an opportunity to read primary documents (statements, manifestos, poetry, essays) from the women’s and gay liberation movements of the late 1960s and 1970s.  The seminar will draw from multiple traditions, focusing on debates concerning both class antagonisms and histories of racialization within the LGBTQ community, as well as lines of convergence between different movement contexts, including the specific way issues of sex and gender emerged out of the social movements of the earlier 1960s.Primary questions for weekly discussions will be cross-culture comparisons between feminist, queer, and trans thought in the U.S., France, and Italy, as well as debates within each of these national contexts. In addition, we will consider how our investigations of these histories may inform our sense of the importance of gender and sexuality within liberation movements taking shape today.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Even as economic pressures and modern technology lead young people to move further and further from the places they grew up, we remain attached to the myth of the family home. The home, we are told, is the nurturing and comfortable space to which we can always return. Even (or especially) when we’ve left it, the family hearth continues to promise a refuge from the wider world. Yet literature and film are replete with another sort of home: isolated but never totally private, familiar but never completely safe.This class explores a number of unconventional homes in order to question our assumptions about family and domesticity. In the course’s first unit, we’ll visit some homes that, while familial, are anything but warm. After that, we’ll turn to a set of non-domestic living spaces: the boarding school, the hospital, the prison, and the hotel. As we move from familial homes to institutional ones, we’ll rethink the oppositions that supposedly distinguish them: between private and public, between what seems natural and what’s obviously artificial, and between the home and everything that isn’t.Since this is an R and C course, its major goals are to improve students’ skills in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, and to explore the relationships between the three skills. In addition to discussing the texts in class, students will write responses to them in a variety of forms, from literary analysis essays to creative projects.Possible texts include:Home:Alison Bechdel, Fun Home

N. EstreichIn this course we will be reading a range of literary works which suggest the complexities of identification. Through readings and discussion, we will explore aspects of affinity and antipathy, attraction and repulsion, complicated sympathies, and personal and political ambivalence. With attention to questions of identity and sociopolitical context, we will particularly consider relationships between individual and community, representations of dissidence, and the effects of recognition and misrecognition within literary narrative. Class assignments, including midterm paper and final essay, will emphasize the development of skills in textual interpretation, writing, and revision.Texts:Course reader will include short works and excerpts by Freud, Bowles, Kleist, Breytenbach, Oates, and others.

J. HockImitatio, the Latin word for “imitation,” was an important literary and rhetorical principle in ancient Rome. In his “Institutes of Oratory,” Quintillian explains the importance of imitatio: “a great portion of art consists in imitation, since, though to invent was first in order of time and holds the first place in merit, it is of advantage to copy what has been invented with success.” To learn to speak well, one had to train oneself by imitating more accomplished orators. In the Renaissance, imitatio was taken up as a pedagogical tool, and students and scholars painstakingly copied and mimicked ancient writings in order to become great stylists themselves. In this class, “imitation” will bring together three different strands of study. In the first place, an introduction to poetry, one of the most fertile grounds of imitation. Taking the classical period (primarily in Latin), the continental Renaissance, the Romantic period and the contemporary periods as our touchstones, we will trace the most important poetic forms – the sonnet, the epic, the ode, and free verse – through the poetic tradition, seeing how writers imitated each other. In order to understand historical practices of writerly imitation, but also to understand poetry from the inside out, we will write our own imitations of the poets we read for class. This writing practice will transition nicely with the second goal of the class, to acquaint students with the skills necessary for researching and writing academic papers. Thirdly, we will take a broad view of imitatio, looking at the ways imitation has been an important practice in religion (“imitatio christi,” for example), art (schools of painters, fakes), and contemporary culture (plagiarism, lip-syncing, Elvis impersonators).Readings will include selections from the following authors and works:Mary Oliver, Rules for the Dance, A Poetry Handbook, Gordon Braden, Petrarchism; Thomas à Kempis, Imitation of Christ; Aristotle, Poetics; Quintillian, Institutes of Oratory, and poems by Bishop, Celan, Collins, Dickinson, Donne, Emerson, Gongora, H.D., Hopkins, Horace, Jonson, Keats, Lucretius, MacLeish, Mallarmé, Millay, Milton, Moore, Petrarch, Pope, Pound, Quevedo, Rilke, Rimbaud, Sexton, Shakespeare, Shelley, Sidney, Spenser, Stevens, Tennyson, Valéry, Verlaine Virgil, Whitman, Wyatt, and Yeat We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In the age of Facebook and Instagram, of tweets and vlogs, it can be difficult to remember that not so long ago the practice of narrating the self was often closely tied to intimate, private, and even secret forms of writing. In this course, we will consider a number of literary texts that experiment with such forms of writing, focusing in particular on the genre of the diary novel. Whether these texts present themselves as diaries, trouble the lines between diaries and related forms of intimate writing, or simply tell stories in which diaries figure prominently, they all explore the relationship between writing and subjectivity. Reading comparatively, we will try to understand why authors from different historical, cultural, and geographic locations have turned to fictional diaries to explore the interplay between identity and difference, subjugation and freedom, and private and public selves. Over the course of the semester, we will be especially attentive to the complex relationship between writing and the self in literature emerging from colonial and postcolonial contexts. Specific readings are subject to change, but will likely include Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Françoise de Graffigny, Letters of a Peruvian Woman; J. M. Coetzee, Foe; Ferdinand Oyono, Houseboy; Mongo Beti, The Poor Christ of Bomba; Mariama Bâ, So Long a Letter; M. G. Vassanji, The Book of Secrets; and Helen Oyeyemi, “if a book is locked there’s probably a good reason for that don’t you think.”We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this class we will take a close and multi-faceted look at books written primarily for children, a category of literature that remains rather under-examined, despite its popularity, persistence, and influence. We will read examples of stories for children written in a number of different times (from the 18th to the 21st centuries) and places (Europe, Britain, North America), and our readings will make use of many different kinds of literary analysis: historical contextualization, analyses that draw on particular literary theories, psychoanalytical approaches, and close readings. We will also pay some attention to the development of the children’s literature industry in the United States and to the current state of children’s publishing.Readings will include, on the one hand, stories by writers like the Brothers Grimm, Carlo Collodi, Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, Tove Jansson, Madeleine L’Engle, Jacqueline Woodson, and E. B. White, and, on the other hand, Propp, Freud, Bettelheim, Shklovsky, and Garber.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Comp. Lit. 100 is designed to present students with texts from various genres and historicial periods, to introduce them to the methods of comparative study.  The thematic focus of this course will be crises of patrilinearity—family romances gone sour. More specifically, we will be looking at how such family crises enable and generate narratives, but also perturb them; how subjects are constituted and deconstructed through descent groups; how the crisis of patrilinearity can become an emblem in literary texts for other cultural crises; and how this theme intersects with the issues of gender and race. Course requirements include three short writing assignments and a final paper based on an oral presentation of a text chosen by the student and read outside of class. Our reading will embrace both literary texts and theoretical/critical discussions of them.Primary reading will includeHomer Odyssey;Aeschylus Oresteia;Sophocles Oedipus the King;Euripides Medea;Shakespeare King Lear;Balzac Père Goriot;Faulkner Absalom, Absalom!;Toni Morrison Beloved.(All texts will be read in English.)We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	This course will examine the relation between narrative and desire in a selection of works from various historical periods, national traditions, and genres.  Questions to be considered include:How do desires generate narratives? How do narratives produce desiring subjects? How might desire interrupt narrative?  Does desire have a gender? What is the relation between epistemological desire and sexual desire?  How might we understand the relation between self-knowledge and the desire for narrative?    We will also look at a selection of critical essays that offer models of desire, of narrative, or of their relation.Required texts:Sophocles, Oedipus Rex

																	How do literary works and films simultaneously disclose and keep their secrets? This course examines the role of secrets in producing and blocking narrative movement, and in releasing and withholding meaning.  We give particular attention to secrets such as the gay closet or racial passing, that, like Poe’s “Purloined Letter,” hide “in plain sight,” and discuss the role of narrative and confession in the construction, circulation and concealment of public and private identities, marked and unmarked by gender, sexual identity, race, or class. We also critically examine the implied analogies between interpretation and detective work, and between reading and religious election. What distinguishes interpretive “insight” from naïve reading? What kinds of ironic relationships obtain between “blind” characters and “perceptive” readers?The course is designed to introduce you to a number of different methodologies that will help you in analyzing texts across different languages and in comparative contexts.

There is both a vast and various literature written from and about desert ecosystems and a literature that uses the figure of the desert to explore cultural barrenness, human mortality, and catastrophe. In this course we will read texts from these diverse traditions, including poems, tracts, essays, novels, and films about life in the Sahara and the Sonora, about mystical and secular experiences of the non-human world, celebrations of sublime nature, and portentous visions of a post-human future.Though the idea of the desert is relevant to a host of contemporary concerns, from droughts and other forms of ecological threats and transformations to the wars, migrations, and varied humanitarian crises taking place in deserts around the world today, this course will also look back to history and prehistory, to forms of culture and expression that developed and flourished in what we tend to think of as the least generative of landscapes. While global in scope, our course will place a particular emphasis on the literatures of the Arab world and the Americas.In the same way that the works examined here explore the delicate and complex systems that underlie the idea or symbol of the desert that we often take for granted, so too will we explore the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader, focusing in particular on the process, as well as the product, of writing.Required Books:(1) Gold Dust by Ibrahim al-Koni
(2) Pedro Páramo by Juan Rulfo
(3) The Tent by Miral al-Tahawy
Class Format: This is a discussion-based seminar rather than a lecture course. Most of our class time will be spent talking about the assigned reading but we’ll also hold regular writing workshops. Some of these workshops will be devoted to specific writing skills, others will involve peer editing.  During the latter we expect you to engage with the work of your peers with the same rigor and
intensity that you bring to the class readings. Every paper that you turn in will first receive the attention of at least one of your fellow students.
Assignments: The bulk of the writing you’ll do in this class will go into the three major papers due at roughly equal intervals over the course of the semester. We expect you to come up with your own topic for each of these papers—you’ll see little in the way of prompts in this class—and to then run the idea by one of us before diving in. Before receiving your final draft of each paper we’ll also expect you to hand in (1) an outline or some other substantial form of writing preparation and (2) a polished draft. Please note that this draft should not be rough work filled with grammatical errors–though we’ll spend some time going over some of the trickier issues in writing mechanics, this class is more about putting together an essay than putting together a sentence. If you’re nervous about a grammatical point, a question of usage, or another mechanical issue, please feel free to shoot us an email and ask about it.These three papers will account for a full 60% of your grade in the course (the first two will be worth 15% apiece and the last one 30%). If you receive a C+ or below on either of your first two papers, we’ll give you one chance to improve that grade through a substantive rewrite. Come talk to us before you start rewriting so that we can hash out exactly what would constitute a “substantive” revision of the paper.Another 25% of your grade will come from shorter writing assignments and presentations.  The final 15% will come from your overall class participation. Though we expect you to contribute to our class discussions, we’re also aware that everyone has a different level of comfort with this specific kind of participation. Thus, in grading your participation we’ll also be taking into account the amount of care and attention that you pay to your bCourses posts, to your short writing assignments, and to the comments you make on your fellow students’ drafts. Office hour visits are another meaningful form of class participation.Rules and Procedures: Timely attendance is mandatory. You will get two fully excused, no-questions-asked absences from the class. For every absence after the first two that you don’t negotiate with us beforehand or later demonstrate to me was prompted by an emergency, medical or otherwise, we’ll drop your participation grade by a third (from an A- to a B+, for example). We’ll also count every two instances of your coming to class late as an unexcused absence.  We’re similarly strict about deadlines. For every calendar day that your paper is late, it will be marked one-third of a grade lower (again, an A- becomes a B+). If you face an emergency that
forces you to miss a deadline, please let us know at least 24 hours before said deadline.Outlines and prewritings can be single-spaced but every paper you turn in must be in a regular font, double-spaced, and feature one-inch margins all around. We’d rather you be honest and turn in work slightly under the expected page count rather than try to trick us by changing your page formatting.Please get yourself a good-sized folder that you can devote exclusively to this class. You’ll be turning your work in in this folder and every time you turn in a new assignment, all of your previous assignments should be in it as well.Finally, all plagiarized work will receive a failing grade. Plagiarism isn’t just copying or buying an entire paper or writing exercise from another student; plagiarism is also copying paragraphs, sentences, or ideas without credit, “quoting without quotation marks,” cutting and pasting (whether from another essay, from a reference work like Wikipedia, or from sites like Shmoop or SparkNotes), or otherwise passing off the thoughts, words, and/or ideas of others as your own, consciously or unconsciously.  Having seen your papers through from conception to outlining to the draft stage, we’ll notice any attempts at plagiarism. So don’t waste your time—it’d be faster and easier to do your own work.  For further information, please see:http://catalog.berkeley.edu/policies /conduct.html#cheating  http://students.berkeley.edu/uga/conduct.aspAdditional Help: If you’d like some extra help on your writing, especially with the mechanics of composition, please head over to the Student Learning Center at the César Chávez Student Center for free tutoring. They’ll either hook you up with a tutor you can meet regularly throughout the semester or help you on a drop-in basis, depending on what you need. You can find their website here:

																	How does language convey meaning? Does it provide us with a comprehensive knowledge of the real? Or, does it solely rely on limited, man-made concepts and terms, which fail to fully express and define the fluidity and materiality in the world? In other words, is language always already ideological? And if so, are there other ways to convey meaning which break free from the limitations of language?In this course we will critically engage with literary texts and films which explore these questions in various ways. One way to address these questions is to focus on the process of signification. We will be asking ourselves: If all language is conventional (based on man-made signs and readymade patterns), how do authors manage to convey meaning in their works? What is the difference between everyday language and poetic/literary language? Can words and signs signify in more than one way? Another way to address this topic is to consider the intersection of language and power. We will be asking ourselves: If language fails to provide sufficient terms to truly define the material conditions in the world, does it mean that language necessarily construct the real? And, if this is the case, how can authors work upon language in order to break free from the ideological construction – in language – of identity categories such as gender, sexuality, class, race and ethnicity?By tracing the various ways in which language and power intersect, we will come to explore how various authors and directors choose to convey meaning precisely by semantical complication, and often even semantical failure. The opportunity to think about subversive modes of signification and expression would lead us into a distinction between different modes of language. Ultimately we will ask ourselves what it means to have a language, whether all speakers of a language speak the same language, and whether other systems of signification operate similarly to language or not.Focusing on literature, film, and criticism, this course will explore these questions as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. With these goals in mind, members of this course will be asked to illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular writing assignments, re-writes, frequent posts to a bcourses forum, and consistent in-class
participation.Required texts:

																	In many ways Shakespeare is the literary inventor of modernity. His plays depict the psychological, political, economic, and social upheavals that mark the transition from the pre-modern world to a world that is recognizably our own. But he is also the most international of all writers. This course will explore Shakespeare’s extraordinary literary originality by studying his most influential plays in an international context. We will locate Shakespeare in the culture of his period by reading his plays in dialogue with masterworks from across Renaissance Europe. We will consider how he and his contemporaries engage with issues of international scope at a time (like our own) of extraordinary political, religious, and economic turmoil. We will read eight major plays by Shakespeare, as well as works by such authors as Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Cervantes, and Petrarch. And we will discuss the global reach of Shakespeare’s work in the centuries since his first productions. This course thus offers an introduction to early modern Europe, an exercise in reading literature in an international context, and an in-depth study of a major author.Reading List:Shakespeare, Hamlet, MacBeth, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Twelfth Night, Henry IV, Part I, The TempestMachiavelli, The PrinceRabelais, PantagruelMontaigne, “Of Cannibals”Petrarch and Wyatt, Selected SonnetsColumbus, “Journals”Calderón, Life is a DreamWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	The literary and artistic avant-garde of the early twentieth century was the most radical expression of European modernism in literature and art. We will be focusing on the four most forceful and creative of the literary movements to have swept through Europe between the 1910’s and the 1930’s: Italian and Russian futurism, dada in Zurich and Paris, Soviet constructivism, and French surrealism. We will be reading (and sometimes performing!) avant-garde poetry, literary manifestos, short performance texts, experimental fiction and memoirs. We will also be paying some attention to parallel developments in the visual arts and cinema.Topics for discussion include literature and revolutionary politics, tradition and modernity, theoretical metalanguage and its relationship to artistic practice, poetic experimentation, the relationship of sound to meaning, the limits of art, the cult of technology, literature and utopia, the rise of mass culture, and the relationship of writing to theories of the unconscious.Writers and artists include: Filippo Marinetti, Valentine de Saint-Point, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitsky, Sergei Eisenstein, Leon Trotsky, Tristan Tzara, Hugo Ball, Andre Breton, and Sigmund Freud.Texts to be purchased:

																	Joy, grief, anxiety, shame, desire, jealousy, fear, hope: emotions are a familiar part of ordinary life, even if it’s sometimes hard to say exactly what they are and where they come from. We tend to talk about feelings in terms of individual experience, but emotions are also public, social, and political, at the same time that publics and politics are very much emotional. Emotions like fear, anxiety, joy, and hope play a role in galvanizing activist movements and political campaigns, they cause economic markets to fluctuate, and they serve to create collectives as well as to determine who is excluded.Nor are emotions neutrally assigned to subjects in the cultural imagination. From “black anger” to “white guilt,” from the “fiery” Latina to the “impassive” Asian, who is understood to be emotional and what emotions they are associated with is frequently organized along lines of race, gender, class, and sexuality, each of which has its own histories in the U.S. At the same time, the experiences of being racialized, gendered, and sexed subjects have psychic implications that accompany the more obvious economic and structural effects of discrimination.In this class, we will examine the cultural politics of emotion in American life by looking at a range of aesthetic texts from the 20th century to the present (novels, memoirs, poems, plays, essays, documentaries, and narrative films). Critical readings from a range of theorists and scholars (from literary studies, cultural studies, sociology, political theory, and philosophy) will aid us in looking at the relations between lived experience and social structures. From Aristotle’s famous formulation of “catharsis” as the aim of tragedy, art has long been understood in relation to the emotions, both those it provokes and those it registers. We will ask what emotions do, what their histories are, how they circulate, or conversely how they “stick” to certain people or certain experiences. At the same time we will also pay attention to the variety of aesthetic strategies that have been used to record, process, express, and critique emotions.Required TextsJunot Díaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar WaoToni Morrison, The Bluest EyeMaxine Hong Kingston, The Woman WarriorMohsin Hamid, The Reluctant FundamentalistFilms (made available at Media Resources or online)David France, How to Survive a PlagueSpike Lee, Do the Right ThingMatthieu Kassovitz, La HaineDouglas Sirk, Imitation of LifeCritical essays will be made available on bCourses and as a course reader.Grading Breakdown Attendance and participation in discussion section (15%) Three 2-page critical reading responses to course texts (10% each, total 20%) Final paper (30%) 5-7pp Final take-home exam (25%)We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

A photographer making art on the fringes of Rio de Janeiro, turning the city’s waste into portraits, and photojournalists who wander Mexico’s capital wiyh their cameras, capturing both the minute details and big stories of everyday city life. No matter how different, all these people produce and practice the city in some way: they write, they wander, they take photographs and ponder what their cities are and might become, all the while navigating urban space but also exploring the complexities of finding and losing histories, objects, and selves within it. But who—and what—gets lost and found in the American city? As cultural, political, and economic centers, can cities foster connection, creativity, and belonging? What gets lost—or pushed into possible oblivion—in and by the city?With these questions in mind, we’ll spend the semester exploring the imagined landscapes of four of America’s most iconic cities—New York, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and Rio de Janeiro. Along the way, we’ll  consider some of the ways in which urban spaces are experienced, constructed, explored, and imagined as spaces where some get lost, others found.Texts and Materials:“Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,” Walt Whitman

J. Jimenez & V. AlcazarHistory is rife with texts, images, and films that position themselves as speaking about or from the “place” of the marvelous.  From miracles to travel narratives to science fiction, many writers and artists in wildly different historical contexts sing their stories by imagining what is, or appears to be, impossible in daily living or by imagining what is yet to be.  While many would say that engaging this mode of writing or storytelling is a sign of the times, the question remains why the marvelous comes in and out of fashion, never truly leaving the cultural field altogether (if not in production, at least in readership).  Our purpose in this class is to begin to answer the question of what is the significance of using the writing strategy or trope of the marvelous, of marking a particular kind of experience as marvelous.  Through careful textual analysis, students in the class will develop unique and complex arguments regarding, to begin with, the following questions:  what is a marvelous text and what is at stake in classifying a text as such?  How does the marvelous as a trope function?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of writing about or in relation to the marvelous?  What is the relationship of the marvelous to the real?  Through reading, writing, and discussion, students will develop critical and self-reflective hypotheses about what is at stake in representing as/the marvelous.Students are expected to actively discuss the texts required for the class, to create original and though-provoking arguments regarding these texts, and to hone their critical-thinking skills through constant revision of writing assignments. This course assumes successful completion of a 1A course at Berkeley or community college or placement in 1B through AP testing or its equivalent. Students should also be aware that a great portion of the class will be dedicated to the marvelous in texts that focus prominently on gender and sexuality. Readings will be selected from the following list.The Golden Ass, ApuleiusThe Story of the Grail (Perceval), Chrétien de Troyes“The Colloquy of the Dogs,” Miguel de CervantesThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot DíazThe Woman Warrior, Maxine Hong KingstonAngels in America, Tony KushnerNew X-Men Imperial, Grant MorrisonBeloved, Toni MorrisonThe Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar WildeWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

H. CruzTaking on the attributes of the opposite gender is as ancient an act as it is problematic. What exactly is so threatening about this kind of crossing? As with most kinds of border disruptions, this one threatens to spread and multiply to other types or kinds of disruptions and must therefore almost always be contained. However, not all crossings are as dangerous. Some even serve to reinforce the received hierarchy of gender while others risk dissolving the very basis of our society. In this class we will examine various examples of masculine women and feminine men across a variety of genres and time periods, in order to identify any possible connections between gender and genre. We will also look closely at the political implications of these crossings for different communities, societies and the states.Texts:Films:

																	References to the word “topos”, place, as signifying home and the homeland, whether used in a limited and local, or in a broader, national context, abound in Greek life, literature and culture. From the point of view of anthropology/ethnography, and as the discipline of “refugee studies” has currently expanded its scope, the theoretical perspectives on what constitutes home and homeland seem to fall into three basic ethnographic categories. The first one, known in cultural anthropology as “sedentarism,” focuses on the geographically fixed nature of home as the place providing the individual with a sense of permanence and continuity. As such, it allows for an emotional connectedness with the physical place. In these terms, home provides a unique meaning to life. It promotes a sense of identity bound to the geographical fixity of one’s homeland. It is the place of one’s actual home and the place of “nostos”, of return. From this sedentarist point of view, refugees are often seen as having suffered double trauma, a loss of home and a loss of identity.The second perspective, the more “cosmopolitan” view, rests on the idea that home can be a movable place. From this perspective, one can be attached, and show emotional allegiance, to more than one places. This view problematizes home as a permanent “topos”. The focus is more on the kinetic nature of home as a modern construct and the possibility that it can be recreated in other places. It includes the metaphorical meaning of diaspora (sowing seeds widely), and of growing in new soil. In this sense, it is the permanence or impermanence of a new home that can effect the individual’s sense of identity. For refugees, identity is continually negotiated as their relationship to places shifts and changes.There is also a third ethnographic position seeking a more nuanced middle road. This approach, which does not see the above two views as mutually exclusive but as collaborative, focuses on both, the need for stability and for motion. Moreover, this view points to the adaptability of the individual and the desire to recreate the lost home. Also, it focuses on the complexity of home as a concept of a place internalized. As such, it can underscore both its temporal dimensions as well as the displaced subject’s emotional bonds. These bonds manifest themselves in the nostalgia evoked by the lost home, a place longed for, a place of desire, and in its reconstruction in memory. It is through this ethnographic position that we can also acknowledge the serious role of imagination. Here, imagination is called forth to reinforce not so much the bond of the individual to the sense of place as to his/her connection with a creative sense of autonomy and subjectivity.In this course, through a selection of novels, a variety of theoretical approaches, and historical material, we will examine the idea of “topos” as a defining concept in the literary constructions of home and homeland.All Greek literary texts are also available in English translation.History and theory are in English.

Session A 5/23-7/1Summer is the season of escapist fiction: if we can’t use our vacations to visit far-off climes in person, at least we can live vicariously through novels about distant, often imaginary places. Tales of travelers questing across the globe have been a cornerstone of popular culture from Homer’s Odyssey to Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet, while these adventure narratives continue to seduce large audiences, we must also consider the political and social ramifications of such texts. What ethical problems might authors face in trying to represent foreignness and “the exotic”? How does the notion of “adventure” become part of imperialist and nationalist projects from the eighteenth century to now? Is adventure a gendered enterprise? And how do contemporary writers rewrite and reconfigure earlier adventure narratives? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments. Texts May Include: Captain Blood, directed by Michael Kurtiz“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Samuel Taylor ColeridgeThe Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Tempest, directed by Julie TaymorRobinson Crusoe, Daniel DefoeFoe, J.M.

Celine PiserTales of San Francisco
This summer, we’ll focus on the city across the bay. San Francisco is known for its diversity and unique character. It is not surprising to find the city featured throughout popular culture—in films, TV shows, literature, music, and even video games. We will take a look at all these media to determine what kind of character San Francisco has come to represent in the past century and why. We’ll compare images of San Francisco as native home and adopted home; we’ll look at the diverse subcultures that have called it home during the twentieth century; we’ll compare its fictional image with the San Francisco we know today. We will also, of course, look at the people that make the city, and focus, in particular, on the languages and voices that share the space. We will ask ourselves if these disparate voices can come together to represent one city, or if they remain discrete, personal representations.We will begin with a look at San Francisco’s famous detective literature, and at a few of its international stylistic precursors and heirs. We’ll read an excerpt of Voltaire’s Zadig before studying a portrait of San Francisco’s dark side in Dashiell Hammett’s 1930 novel The Maltese Falcon, and its 1941 film adaptation by John Huston. We’ll also look at Daniel Pennac’s treatment of the Parisian detective in The Fairy Gunmother, and question his representations of the multiethnic neighborhood of Belleville.Next, we’ll look at San Francisco as a hub of immigration, multiculturalism, and multilingualism. We’ll read Jade Snow Wong’s representation of Chinese American immigrants in San Francisco in Fifth Chinese Daughter and a collection of short stories by Latino writers in San Francisco. We’ll also read some travel narratives and travel-inspired poetry by early visitors to San Francisco, such as Rudyard Kipling, to get an idea of how the city has developed over the past few centuries.Finally, we will examine how San Francisco has become a home to alternative lifestyles. We’ll study the Beat Generation, the San Francisco Renaissance and the Japanese poetry traditions that influenced the movement. In Tales of the City, Armistead Maupin writes about sexuality in 1970s San Francisco. We’ll compare his portrait to Gus Van Sant’s film about Harvey Milk, the US’s first openly gay politician, SF city supervisor and self-titled “Mayor of Castro Street.” If we have time, we’ll take a field trip across the bay to see the mythic city in person, and perhaps attend the theatrical production of Maupin’s novel.Our work on fiction, nonfiction, poetry and film will be supplemented by critical readings from literary theory, sociology and linguistics. You will be expected to complete all reading and writing assignments in a timely manner and actively participate in class discussion. Course grade will be based on demonstrating careful reading and analytical ability through class participation, short assignments, a group project, and analytical and research papers.

(It’s clear that I still don’t know how to travel. . .)
–Mário de Andrade, O turista aprendiz (The Apprentice Tourist)What does it mean to travel? How does the experience of ‘taking a trip’ shape how we see ourselves and our culture, especially in relationship to what we encounter outside of the place we consider ‘home’? If, as Brazilian writer Mário de Andrade implies, travel is something we learn, not just do, how are we taught to travel and why?In this course, we will take these questions as a point of departure for our own journey through a rich set of materials that portray different experiences in travel.  In our wanderings from descriptions of homecomings to touristy vacations, from journeys of ‘discovery’ to ethnographic missions, we will try to unpack the tensions inherent in questions of ‘here vs. there,’ ‘self vs. other,’ and the dynamics of cultural encounter.Possible Readings and Viewings: Excerpts from Christopher Columbus’ Diario“The Smallest Woman in the World,” Clarice Lispector“The Ethnographer,” Jorge Luis BorgesExcepts from Lose Your Mother, Saidiya HartmanPoems by Etheridge Knight and Walt Whitman (“The Meaning of Ancestry,” “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry”)The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara KingsolverThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot DíazBabel, Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu or Darjeeling Limited, Directed by Wes AndersonShort selections from James Clifford’s Writing Culture and Routes, Mary Pratt’s Imperial Eyes, and works by Roland Barthes and Levi-Strauss

Juan CaballeroWhile making no claim to proportional representation or thoroughness, this class tries to survey some of California’s literary and artistic output that directly addresses the intense hybridity of California’s history.  Looking at writing in various genres and media, this class will try to make the concept of California as unstable as those of race, ethnicity, and community. Without snubbing the particularity of each text, we will look at what these contesting and at times even revisionist gestures have in common across genres, communities, personas and identities. In addition to high literary fiction and poetry, we will also be looking at how more popular traditions of essayism and wide-readership/”popular” history strive to intervene in California’s self-image, as well as looking at some film, and video art.What this means for the objectives of class discussion and student work is that the emphasis will not be on constructing a corpus of works that “represent” a real California, but exactly the opposite: the emphasis will be on each artist’s resistance to such a representative function, on each artist’s own California and what strategies they use to posit their history alongside or against a unitary and univocal California. This is a course in Comparative Literature, not History or Sociology: our goal is to compare and combine strategies without losing what’s unique to each, to complicate but never to circumscribe the possibilities of what the name California can mean. Each artist chosen for consideration has been chosen for their individual conception of American Culture and Californian history, as “representatives” neither of historical or demographic groups nor of literary or artistic schools or tendencies. Students are encouraged to select for writing works that engage them personally, but also to take from this class a vocabulary and a toolkit for understanding how even the most personal art practice congeals into and exploits tendencies, schools, genres, traditions, and public discourses, with or without the artist’s intent. It is also hoped that each student will take away an enriched and more open definition of what American and Californian Cultures mean and “look like”.Central texts (available at Student Store):

Session A: 5/23-7/1Contemporary American Genres, Contemporary American Identities Classification can seem simple, but more often than not, it is a complicated and problematic operation. This class will engage with the quandary of classification in two related and highly contested areas: the mosaic of contemporary American identities and contemporary American literature(s). More precisely, we will examine the ways in which popular, distinctively American genres in film and fiction – including, but not limited to, the hard-boiled detective novel and film noir, the comic book and graphic novel, the Broadway musical, blaxploitation film, and the road movie – can be used to frame questions of identity and culture in different, surprisingly revelatory, lights. How do the specific, often controversial, formal elements of the works we will examine add to the ever-evolving dialogue around contemporary American culture? How do the authors and filmmakers we will discuss appropriate, adapt, and challenge the conventions of their chosen genres in order to elucidate questions of ethnic, racial, and sexual identity? These experiments and explorations in genre ask us to confront conventional representations of contemporary America: who makes them, for whom, and why? Furthermore, how do these interpretations of genre blur the margins between the literary and the popular (high versus low culture), center and periphery, “American” and “alien”?ReadingsSherman Alexie, FlightOctavia Butler, FledglingMichael Chabon, The Yiddish Policeman’s UnionJunot Diaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar WaoGene Luen Yang, American Born ChineseArt Spiegelman, MausCourse Reader with excerpts from additional primary, theoretical, and critical sources (available from ZeeZee Copy) ViewingsBill Condon, DreamgirlsDanny Leiner, Harold and Kumar Go to White CastleJustin Lin, Better Luck Tomorrow Quentin Tarantino, Jackie BrownQuentin Tarantino, Kill Bill: Vol. 1Selected episodes from Leave it to Beaver, The Cosby Show, Married… With Children, The Simpsons, All American Girl, and Ugly Betty

B. RubergA good ghost story is never just about an apparition. It’s about the society that created that ghost, and what such a society fears: race relations, changing gender roles, disease, technology, foreignness.  Indeed, the thing that makes gothic writing so compelling, says Edith Wharton, is its ability to both explore and obscure the “unspeakable” — that real-life social anxiety hiding in the symbolic backdrop of the paranormal tale.This class will use two centuries of American gothic writing and film, from Edgar Allen Poe to Toni Morrison to Fight Club, as a lens through which to identify and unpack cultural problematics of race, gender, and class at various moments in U.S. history.  Combining literary close reading with historical non-fiction for background, we will investigate how much tales of the most unreal (monsters, spirits, otherworldly madness) can teach us about our social reality.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

 L. WagnerYoung adult fiction, cable television drama, sportswriting, the Western— all are genres that we’re likely to associate more with leisure entertainment than historical inquiry.  And yet, the parameters and conventions of each provide authors with a particular mode of storytelling through which they can imagine the lived experience of past moments and explore its tensions in ways the historical record might not.In this course, we’ll turn to contemporary works of American fiction, both literary and visual, that cast a look back on various moments of the country’s history from the vantage point of the past thirty years.  We’ll follow Toni Morrison back to the early days of American slavery to look at race and gender in the pre-revolutionary colonies.  We’ll accompany M.T. Anderson’s young Octavian Nothing as he navigates the political unrest of Boston during the Revolutionary War and rebels against his status as “property” and as racial Other.  We’ll turn to the American Southwest, to Cormac McCarthy’s intensely violent imagining of the mid-19th century U.S./Mexico border, and travel to Deadwood, at the outskirts of the Dakota Territory, to chart the camp’s attempt to transform itself from a wilderness outpost into an established American town.  Finally, we’ll end up in the 20th century, where we’ll explore Don DeLillo’s portrait of 1950s Cold War politics through the lens of a baseball game, America’s pastime.Through a close reading of these literary texts, which we’ll supplement with additional historical and critical readings, we’ll address questions of race, ethnicity, gender, and culture during the defining historical moments that the texts take as their focus, and we’ll consider how the mode of historical fiction allows us to view the fractures, tensions, and anxieties of that past moment.  In addition to asking what these texts can tell us about America’s past, we’ll also interrogate what these works suggest about the contemporary America in which they were written and how they might understand their own— and our— place in its history.Required Texts:A Mercy, Toni Morrison

Session D 7/5-8/12 At the heart of this course is coming to terms with the question: what is an American? This is a fraught question; the answer seems everywhere self-evident, for many, yet what is or makes an American is radically contingent. In this course, we will approach the question of who, what, and/or how one is an American by focusing on three discrete historical time periods (settlement and colonization, the consolidation of the U.S. as an independent nation-state, and the late twentieth century) and by attempting to track the encounters of different sorts of people—different sorts of “Americans”—inscribed in narratives, plays, and novels. In the first phase of the class, we will read about and study the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans, how settlement and colonization were mutually catastrophic for colonizers and natives alike, and how representations of captivity contribute to our understanding of colonial (European) subjects and Native American “insurgents.” We will then explore the founding of the American Republic and register the transition from colony to nation, again focusing on the encounter between the newly constituted American citizens and their slaves. Finally, we will investigate the self-consciously multicultural United States of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century by focusing on the encounter between immigrants and sexual minorities—New Americans—with/in the United States and its peoples. Throughout the course, we will complement our understanding of “American” as U.S. citizens with texts from our American cousins from the “South” to help us complicate what it has meant to be an American from within and without the nation. Not only will we challenge and potentially generate new meanings for “American,” we will also engage in a discussion of the reified concepts of race, gender, and ethnicity as they intersect with competing notions of “American.”

																	In this course, we will read a variety of fictional texts in order to explore the ways in which stories can be told. Our starting point will be the whys and hows of writing and reading: why would an author decide to withhold information? How does a reader perceive a first-person narrator vs. a third-person one? How does an author imagine and invoke an audience? How does an author show what is going on in a character’s mind?We’ll analyze many forms – a medieval romance, a 17th century novel, a modern novella, and several short stories – from many different times, places, and traditions. As we look at how authors choose to convey their stories and how those choices affect our understanding of their narratives, we will also consider strategies for presenting our own arguments about literature.Required texts:The Princesse de Clèves (Oxford World Classics, translated by Terence Cave) – Madame de LafayetteA Lost Lady, Willa CatherCourse readerWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In his recent Antinomies of Realism, Frederic Jameson identifies an unresolvable tension in the realist novel between two impulses. One is familiar enough: it goes under the banner of récit, the tale, the story, or simply “narrative.” It’s characterized by a movement of progress and a temporality organized by past-present-future. The other impulse, which Jameson curiously calls “affect,” is everything that impedes this narrative movement. In his analysis this affective impulse is characterized by a dilatory, perpetual presentness, and its growing dominance in the later 19th century leads to the dissolution of realism into modernism.In the twentieth century, theorists of the novel, whether from the perspective of structuralism, narratology, or Marxist criticism, have tended to privilege the narrative impulse, enshrining it as central to the novel form. In this seminar we will turn our attention instead to narrative’s lesser-known others, what Cathy Gallagher recently described as the “unmapped continent of nonnarrative novelistic features” – or, everything we read for when we don’t read for the plot.Our critical corpus will feature a range of histories and theories of the European novel, e.g. Auerbach, Lukács, Bakhtin, Genette, Jameson, Moretti, Rancière, as well as affect theory, e.g. Deleuze, Sedgwick, Brennan, Berlant, Ngai. The past few decades have seen an enormous surge of interest in affect, and we will pay particular attention to how it is registered and produced through literary form. Our literary corpus will be a set of novels that charts a trajectory from realism to modernism, e.g. Balzac’s Père Goriot, Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, Zola’s The Belly of Paris, Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Woolf’s The Waves, Barnes’s Nightwood (final reading list to be determined). Students are also welcome to write final papers on literary texts in their own area of specialization.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Some of the topics we’ll be thinking about include the role of institutions in shaping social identity, gender roles and identity, selfhood and community, forms of social adaptation and
resistance, and various cultural significations attached to ‘growing up’.This is a writing class as well as a discussion class. Over the semester, we’ll be talking about writing and doing plenty of writing and revision. There will be opportunities to build writing skills in short assignments in class and in progressively longer written assignments which you will submit over the semester.  Two key skills which we’ll be working on over the semester include making and developing observations about what you have read in a close reading of the text, and producing a written argument which is supported by evidence.Texts:The Brothers Grimm, selected fairytales (online link)

Please bring a hard copy printout of PDFs to class on the days on which we were discussing them.  As we will be referencing texts on the syllabus when discussing them in class, it is important to bring hard copy print-outs of pdfs and any
readings to class on the day that we are covering them.Course requirements:Course requirements are:  one short diagnostic essay (2 pp); three  2 pp. assignments, of which one must be submitted in revised form; five one-page assignments of reading response and textual observation, of which one must be revised; one 3-4 pp midterm paper (draft and final version); and a 5 pp. final paper (draft and final version).  Students will be required to make one group presentation (approximately 10 min), and to make posts on the online forum as assigned over the semester.All assignments and papers must be submitted as typed, doublespaced hard copy with standard 1 inch margins.  Please print your assignments double-sided.  Submit the final version of any revised assignment or paper securely clipped together with the hard copy of your draft and any comments received.  Submitting all assignments and revisions is a requirement for passing this R1A class. Please also be aware that you must meet the page requirements of assignments, as total page counts of written assignments are
an important requirement of this writing course.Attendance and class participationAttendance and active classroom participation (paying attention and constructively participating in discussion) are an important component of this class.  In-class discussion is an important way of sharing your ideas about class material with others, and learning from others’ responses.  For purposes of facilitating class participation and limiting in-class distractions, please be sure to turn off and put away your cell phones, smart phones, I-Pods, tablets, laptops and other electronic communication devices during the class.Attendance is important. Each unexcused absence will lower your final grade by one level (from A- to B+, from B- to C+, etc.).  Seven unexcused absences is an automatic fail of the class.Lateness policyIt is your responsibility to plan your schedule so that this course does not conflict with your other activities and responsibilities. Please arrive on time and avoid scheduling conflicts which require you to leave early.   In general, please do not leave the classroom and return during class time as this can be disruptive. A pattern of lateness will affect your grade. Three latenesses to class, defining lateness as arriving to class more than five minutes after the start time, will count as one unexcused absence or missed class. Any
lateness in turning in graded assignments will result in dropping the grade of the assignment one level (from A- to B+, from B- to C+) for each day of lateness.Attendance policy for the first 2 weeks of classAttendance is mandatory for the first two weeks of classes. Roll will be taken every day during this period.  Enrolled and waitlisted students who do not attend all classes during the first two weeks may be dropped from the class.  At the end of the first and second week of classes, students will be added from the waitlist.  If you are attempting to add into this class and did not attend the first day, you will be expected to attend all class meetings thereafter and, if space permits, you will be allowed to enroll.  No students will be added after end of the second week of the term without permission from the Department.  Students can only be added from the wait-list.Grade breakdownParticipation (Attendance, contribution to class discussions, group presentations, and required online posts):  20%

																	The ongoing production of Hollywood films set at sea suggests that even in today’s age of mass air travel and instantaneous global communication, we still hunger for a good tale of ocean adventure. What accounts for the lasting resonance of the age-old association of sea travel with adventure and of seamen (and women) with the telling of tall tales? What is the singular relationship between the openness and remoteness of the sea and the unbridling of imagination and suspension of disbelief that make fiction work? In this course, we will draw on a wide range of genres and literary traditions to consider the sea as an imaginary space, one vast enough to encompass tall tales and sea yarns, but also colonial histories and the oscillations of modern identities and consciousnesses.In fulfillment of the Reading and Composition requirement, this class aims to improve the students’ abilities to write clearly, effectively, and accurately about subjects of intellectual complexity in order to prepare them for the demands of college-level coursework.  This class also emphasizes the inherent value of the critical reading and critical thinking skills that make such writing possible. To these ends, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling analytical paper.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:1. read texts from a wide variety of literary genres and media closely and critically.2. present their analyses and interpretations of these texts orally in class discussion.3. communicate close readings and interpretations of literary texts in convincingly argued and well written essays.4. reflect critically on their own written work as they draft and revise essays.Required Texts (Available for purchase at the campus bookstore) Herman Melville, Moby Dick Wordsworth Classics ISBN 9781853260087 Juan José Saer, The Witness Serpent’s Tail ISBN 9781846686917 Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse Harcourt ISBN 9780156030472Suggested Texts David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen, Writing Analytically, Seventh Edition ISBN 9781285436500Other assigned readings can be found in the course reader, available for purchase at Krishna Copies 2001 University Ave. Students will also be required to view 4 films (see schedule of classes).

																	Google Street transports us to Machu Picchu, and virtual reality allows us to stroll through Versailles… Enchanted by this experience of proximity, do we still have a sense of direction(s)? In this course, literature will be our compass as we think about how the two cardinal axes—North South, East West—have at various moments in history provided understandings, and perhaps misunderstandings, of the way countries, continents, and the whole world function.Together we will explore two main destinations. On the one hand, we will traverse Italy, traveling south and off the traditional tourist track. Some of the questions we might ask, with literary texts as our guide, include: Why did Italian Southerners historically face social and economic discrimination, and how does this discrimination continue today? How did Southern Italian writers construct, invent, and perhaps even “sell” a concept of their own South to a non-Southern audience, and how does this compare with constructions and inventions of non-Southern writers?On the other hand, we will embark on a transatlantic journey back to the US, rediscovering it through immigrants’ eyes. Former Soviet and former Yugoslavian, Russian, Russian and Ukrainian Jewish authors will help us ask: how does arriving from the (Communist) East shape the American dream? What can these writers tell us about America that the locals do not notice, and why does it matter that they write in English? How do their perceptions of their own countries change and what do they discover when they decide to travel back East?Finally, we will consider how these two case studies echo larger issues: conceptions of the Global South in other geographic and political contexts; East/West divisions and the impact, to this day, of Cold War mentalities.In this writing-intensive course, you will use your critical reflections on the texts as starting points for developing two papers. You will develop your papers through a series of brainstorming assignments, drafts, in-class workshops, peer reviews, and revisions. In addition, you will also complete shorter weekly reading responses and assignments devoted to specific elements of essay writing.Literary texts may include:Texts:North South• Luigi Pirandello, “Sicilian Limes”• Elena Ferrante, My Brilliant Friend**• Luca Miniero, Benvenuti al SudCritical Writing Aids• David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen,Writing AnalyticallyEast West• Vladimir Nabokov, Pnin• Lara Vapnyar, “Luda and Milena”• Aleksandar Hemon, The Book of My Lives• Selected poetry by Joseph Brodsky,Czesław Miłosz, Ilya Kaminsky, andKatia Kapovich**You will be required to buy/order this book on your own via your method of choice (e.g. Amazon, local bookstores).

																	“The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went on olden-day sailing ships with Joseph Conrad. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling. She travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in an English village.”― Roald Dahl, MatildaLiterature, artwork, and films have the powerful ability to transport us to worlds beyond our own, to create fantastic places of imagination, and to construct societies and populations different from anything we might ever have encountered. In this course we will examine the ways in which worlds are invented and represented in literature, art, and film, and consider how notions of community, constitution, and social norms can be reevaluated through interpreting new and alternate perspectives.Readings, images, and films in this class will help us to question the ways in which everyday constants such as time, space, and even knowledge and science can be revised into volatile and sometimes ambiguous constructions—and what such instability might mean. In our discussions we will analyze how the definitions of “world” in literary texts are oftentimes paradoxical, with underlying allegorical, political, and ironical meanings. Through fantastical, mythological, scientific, and realist novels, short stories, essays, art, and film, we will explore the ways in which literary texts allow us to escape from our own conceptions of the world to the places of another’s fabrication, and to consider the effects of other-worldly travel: what do we learn in those encounters, what do we leave behind, and how are we changed?

																	“Every account of the origins of the state starts from the premise that “we”—not we the readers but some generic we so wide as to exclude no one—participate in its coming into being. But the fact is that the only “we” we know—ourselves and the people close to us—are born into the state; and our forebears too were born into the state as far back as we can trace. The state is always there before we are. . . . Those who chose and choose to stay outside the compact become outlaw.” –J.M. Coetzee, Diary of a Bad YearIn this course, we will ponder the complex relationship between the law and the individual.  Under what conditions (if any) it is morally permissible to break the law? Is there such a thing as a “higher” law (moral or divine) that transcends state law?  Since we are born into what philosopher Thomas Hobbes calls the “social contract”—a set of mandates which we do not choose but must obey—can we ever extricate ourselves from the Law?Literature and film will be our guide in asking these questions.  Alongside Kafka and his character, K., we will ask whether it is possible to be outside the law; with Toni Morrison and Sidney Lumet, we will explore the tragic fate of the individual who becomes outlaw through desperation; and, in watching Burnat and Dividi’s documentary Five Broken Cameras, we will consider whether a human being can be “illegal.” We will also consider the fate of literature that has itself been banned or “outlawed,” such as Thoreau’s On the Duty of Civil Disobedience.One of the fundamental aims of this course is to sharpen writing and critical thinking skills though a process of essay writing and revision.  A series of short writing assignments will build toward the final project, a 10- to 12-page research paper based on your critical engagement with a literary work and with some of the scholarly discourse surrounding that work.However, critical thinking is also honed through play, performance, discussion, and debate.  In this class, you will have ample opportunity to express yourself creatively and collaboratively.  Halfway through the semester, you will be asked to present a section of Sophocles’ Antigone as a group performance project.  Throughout the semester, you will be asked to turn in turn in short creative writing assignments.  And, as this is a seminar-style course rather than a lecture, you’ll frequently be asked to share your thoughts in small discussion groups and with the class.  It is important that you participate in these discussions: I view the classroom as a place of collective endeavor where each of us (including the instructor) learns from the others.  That said, if you feel shy speaking in front of the class, there will be other ways to voice your thoughts, including in my office hours.Texts includeToni Morrison, Beloved

																	How, in our recent past and contemporary moment, might a groundbreaking body of poetry—radically innovative in form and content, with great international resonance, and widely perceived to have “gone for broke,” as Theodor W. Adorno famously put it—find its poetics taken up by poets and others artists of different languages, cultures, and sociopolitical situations? This seminar will consider a telling episode in the history of that emphatically comparatist question.  We’ll spend approximately the first half of the semester reading the German-language poet Paul Celan (1920-1970); in the latter part of the semester, we’ll read poetry from across the Americas that responds to Celan’s work, or that has been received in dialogue with it.  More of our American-poetry readings will come from the United States than any other individual country in the hemisphere; but we’ll also be reading a good deal of poetry from the Caribbean (French, Spanish, and English-speaking); from México, Argentina, and Chile; and from both English-speaking Canada and Québec.Often deemed one of Europe’s greatest, and most influentially experimental post-World War II poets, Celan is probably also the figure most often placed, together with Adorno, at the center of the “Poetry after Auschwitz” debates. Reading primarily in English translation (and sometimes looking too at French and Spanish translations), we’ll read extensively in Celan’s poetry, poetics and criticism. We’ll always keep the original German texts before us, and we’ll regularly refer to them in relation to our translated versions, to understand Celan’s prosody in ways that will be comprehensible and helpful even for those who don’t read German.  (Ability to read in German—and/or Spanish and French—will of course prove beneficial, but is by no means required for the seminar.) As we read Celan, we’ll consider some of the poetry he regarded as foundational for his writing; and we’ll read poet-contemporaries with whom he engaged.  We’ll also undertake readings in some of the aesthetics, critical theory, and philosophy that inform Celan’s work, or that have been significant for its reception history. Among the central issues taken up will be the notoriously “difficult,” “hermetic,” “elliptical,” “obscure” character of Celan’s poetry.  We’ll try to evaluate Celan’s claim that the difficulty stems largely from the poetry’s materials themselves, and that his perceived radical experimentalism was simply what was required to bring the materials into form and expression.The seminar will also take up the social and personal history often retold in accounts of Celan and his art. Born and raised in Romania (but with German as a foundational language if not a mother-tongue), interned in a Romanian-fascist labor camp during the war, Celan—having lost his parents to the Holocaust—lived most of his postwar life in France. Celan composed almost all his major poetry in German; he was thus continually vexed by the problem of how to make poems in the very language in which the National Socialist genocide had just been carried out. His wrestling with that and related dilemmas—and his development in consequence of unprecedented formal means of artistic expression that could begin to do justice to his given materials (materials derived from “what has happened,” Celan’s term for the Holocaust)—led to the creation of a remarkable body of poetry that broke new ground while holding onto, and indeed intensifying, much in the history of lyric (albeit via a severely attenuated, though notably virtuosic, musicality).Shifting hemispheres, we’ll turn to consider how poetry and poetics in the Americas, starting in the mid-1950s, attempts to understand what Celan is doing in poetry and what he is asking postwar poetry to attempt. Among our queries—which we’ll see various poets likewise raising—will be the degree to which Celan proves translatable (in the literal sense of the translation of his poems into English, French, Spanish; and in the metaphorical sense of attempted translations of his poetry’s poetics, aesthetics, ethics, and politics to contexts that will involve, among other things, the concerns and claims of the working class,  anti-colonial, civil rights, feminist, and anti-war movements).  We’ll observe this questioning perhaps above all in poets’ processes of thinking, in their poetry and criticism, about what is shared and what’s distinct in the historical experiences of European anti-semitism and New World slavery and racism: their thinking, in short, about what in Celan’s pathbreaking poetry in the wake of European fascism and genocide can, and cannot, help them as their artistic work develops its own relations to pressing ethical and sociopolitical matters.  Suffusing these reflections will be the issue of what kinds of critical agency—if any—might be generated from Celanian poetics, and how such agency would relate to longstanding notions of art’s ethical and sociopolitical commitment or engagement.In addition to Celan’s work, the poetry we’ll read will range from brief excerpts to more substantial selections by a number of poets including, most likely: Hölderlin, Heine, Dickinson, Mallarmé, Rilke, Sachs, Brecht, Bachmann, Daive, Albiach, Du Bouchet, Césaire, Glissant, Monchoachi, Zurita, Gelman, Pizarnik, Perlongher, Paz, Castellanos, Blaser, Mouré, Brossard, Rothenberg, Duncan, Rich, Levertov,  Palmer, Mackey, Rankine, and others.  Critical, theoretical, and/or philosophical readings will likely include texts by Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse, Heidegger, Derrida, Agamben, Lacoue-Labathe, Felstiner, Rothenberg, Bernstein, Carson, and Coetzee. Depending on time, we may also work with some filmic, musical, and visual art in which Celan figures.Required books:–Poems of Paul Celan, Revised and Expanded, translated, with an Introduction and Postscript, by Michael Hamburger (New York: Persea Books, 2002).  ISBN: 0-89255-276-X–Paul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew  by John Felstiner (Yale University Press, 02/12/01, Paper $19.00, ISBN: 9780300089226 1995 (paper, 2001))–Paul Celan: Collected Prose,  trans., with an introduction, by Rosmarie Waldrop (NY: Fyfield Books/Routledge, 2003)  ISBN: 0-415-96723-6     ISBN-10: 0415967236

																	Pessimism: from pessimus: the worst. But free from bad to worse, let alone good, better, best, is it possible to think of this category non-relationally, as its own always already bad ontology? In this course, we will read texts of pessimism, such as cynicism, cultural & racial pessimism, & bleak ecologies. Optimism, however, will be dedicated to the writing component of this R1A as we work progressively on both critical thinking and & how to structure and express such thinking in writing.Required Texts:

																	In this course we will explore various word-and-image partnerships (and rivalries). We will consider early artists’ books such as William Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience, ekphrasis (that is, vivid visual description) in Classical poetry, and contemporary comic books and graphic novels. Homer will show us how well words can paint a picture, while editorial cartoonists will illustrate how images alone can convey a story. In order to understand these texts better, both as verbal and visual narratives, we will read pertinent theoretical work (W.J.T. Mitchell, Erwin Panofsky) and we will consider what distinguishes text from image, their respective “traditional” purposes, and areas of overlap between their usual functions.Texts will include:William Blake, Songs of Innocence and ExperienceBruno Schulz, The Street of CrocodilesDavid B., selections from EpilepticSiri Hustvedt, The Blazing WorldWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Disease attacks the interior and exterior of the human body, presenting psychological and emotional bifurcations of self. Contagious diseases (especially if little understood) can pose a radical challenge to families, caretakers, and governing structures. Pandemics have often been perceived as a moral condemnation of human depravity, yet they have in turn engendered some of the brightest examples of human virtue. This course will explore various works concerning plagues that have visited us in recent history, and those qualities in ourselves that threaten to plague a healthy society.While these questions and proposed texts will furnish us with material for rich discussions, this class is chiefly geared to improve your writing. We will concentrate on both mechanics and style, learning how to read closely, formulate interesting arguments, gather evidence, and organize claims into persuasive essays.

																	What’s in a word? Be it in daily communication, lawful jurisdiction, or the figurative worlds of the literary, whether instructing or indoctrinating, exalting or exacting, how do words play on worlds? As often as words bewitch us, conjuring by artifice, so too do words fail us, distorting by approximation. How does language ring true, and how does language lie? And what of words across languages, when words cross borders? What shrinks or swells, what is lost or found in translation? These are but a few of the questions this course will address—you can take my word for it.In this class, we’ll embark on an exploration of word and world, as we travel across borders and centuries, with words as both our object of study and mode of expression. We’ll tackle how poems and plays, novels, films, and podcasts both use and abuse language. While investigating the words we read, so too will we scrutinize the words we write. We’ll explore the many choices, both simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating interpretations of a text to a reader. As a Reading & Composition course, sustained critical engagement with the process of writing will guide our intellectual exploration of plays on words: on the page, in the classroom, and beyond.Texts will likely include:(1) The Tempest by William Shakespeare (Folger Shakespeare Library Edition)
(2) The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Díaz
(3) Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw
(4) Nineteen Eighty-Four by George OrwellA course reader will contain selections from Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote, Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons, Jorge Luis Borges’ Collected Fictions, Franz Kafka’s Parables and Paradoxes, and Leslie Jamison’s The Empathy Exams; with poetry by Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, Anne Carson, Alejandra Pizarnik, E.E.

																	In this seminar, offered jointly under the auspices of the Law School and Comparative Literature, we will examine some of the conceptual and thematic places where literature and law cross over into each other’s domain. The focus will be on novel reading – Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Pnin and perhaps Lolita – and on texts where crime, judgment and punishment assume particular procedural, narrative, moral or metafictive importance. We will pay particular attention to the themes of transgression, healing and vengeance and how they play out in legal and metafictive contexts. We will discuss cases where ethics and aesthetics pull in opposite directions – where bad or even good writing can be a crime. Dostoevsky’s legal commentaries – the Kornilova and Kairova cases – will also be addressed.We will search for conceptual cross-over points – what happens to notions of privacy, surveillance, even jurisdiction in a literary text. We will examine permutations of the relationship between author and hero and author and reader; are these relationships adversarial, contractual, erotic? The crucial texts will be the novels, the essential procedure will be close reading (both prosecutorial /aggressive and protective/deferential), but we will also read several works of literary theory as well as scholarly attempts to link literature and law. The course will seek to foster an exchange of views between graduate students in the humanities and law students on the value, cost and significance of engaging with legal issues in literary texts. How might literary scholars benefit from reading like lawyers, and vice versa?3 Hours/week (1 session); open to graduate students in the humanities and to law students. No particular background in law or comparative literature is required, but students should be prepared to read up to 250 pages of fiction a week. All participants will lead occasional oral discussions; law students have the option of a final exam (and midterm?) in lieu of a final paper.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this seminar we will explore developments in the field of translation studies that have taken it beyond the once common metaphors of fidelity and betrayal, of being faithful or unfaithful to the “original.” We’ll focus on (mis)translations as symptomatic of the poetic and political dynamics of the negotiations between cultures in a particular historical moment. We’ll discuss a variety of approaches to the theory of translation, from system theory to postcolonial and globalization studies, both by reading critically and by theorizing from the translation practice itself. Central issues will include the role of translation in the construction of national and transnational literary histories, (un)equal power relations in the circulation between source and target text, recovering the role of agency in translation, and translation as intertextual practice.Participants will experiment with collaborative translations of poetry from “their” language(s) and provide a comparative critical analysis of the poetics and politics implicit in influential translation projects in these languages. The modernist poetry of Anna Margolin (1887 Belarus-1952 New York) in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition will serve as our anchor, providing both a case study and an alternative model for theorizing translation “from the margins.”Students will contribute to a seminar Reader, work in small groups and present their translation and critical process to the seminar. Collaborative oral and written projects will be encouraged.

																	The course involves practical engagement in literary translation.   Each member of the group will have a translation project for the semester, which can be poetry or prose, in any genre, from any language, and from any historical period.  Every week two of the participants will circulate specimens of the their projects, and we will spend the afternoon discussing their work, raising questions and proposing solutions in a collaborative spirit.   The course is conceived in the conviction that the process of translation is central to literary studies.  There is no other activity that compels this degree of engagement in the literary text, its word-choices, its deployment of diction, syntax, sound, and much else.  The act of literary translation thus should be deeply instructive for any student of literature, especially of comparative literature, even if he or she has no aspiration to publish translations.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Fiction is full of characters who exert a pull on their readers: those in whom we see versions of ourselves, those for whom we sense an immediate bond of friendship or feel an intense enmity, those we hate to love or love to hate, and those who remain forever inscrutable no matter how hard we try to get inside their thoughts and feelings. While one of our first instincts as readers may be to respond to such characters in terms of attraction and aversion, as friend or as foe, we’re also told repeatedly that one of the cardinal sins of serious literary engagement is to “identify” with the figures who populate the worlds we read about, who are, after all, mere words on the page.This course proposes to take seriously our reactions to literary characters: rather than simply dismiss our impulse to respond to these fictional figures as real people, we’ll interrogate exactly how and why fictional texts make us respond as we do. We’ll encounter protagonists who are themselves prone to over-identify with the fictional worlds they consume in books and who have exerted an undue influence over the lives (and deaths) of their past readers.We’ll meet characters whose charisma exerts a magical pull over us, and others whose thoughts and behavior repel us. We’ll think about what makes a character representative, what differentiates a protagonist from a minor character, and what strategies authors use to represent the complexities of human consciousness. Our investigation will be based in a close reading of the characters we encounter together in our course texts. With these literary works as our common terrain, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading and analytical writing skills, learning to become more careful readers and to advance increasingly complex interpretive arguments about literary texts.Course requirements include active class participation, a diagnostic essay, a close reading paper, a midterm paper and final research paper (both of which will be revised), and frequent short analytical and creative writing assignments.Required Texts:The Sorrows of Young Werther, Johann Wolfgang von GoetheLucy, Jamaica KincaidMrs. Dalloway, Virginia WoolfRequired Screenings:The Sopranos (Season 1, Episodes 1-5), David ChaseDo The Right Thing, Spike LeeA course reader, available at ICLP (Instant Copy and Laser Printing, 2138 University Avenue), will contain Flaubert’s “A Simple Heart,” Kafka’s “The Judgment,” and Wallace’s “The Depressed Person,” excerpts from Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and Cervantes’s Don Quixote, and optional readings on writing and research.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

K. KadueWhen chastity works, nothing happens. A story centered on the absence of sex might not sound like much of a story at all, but chastity, along with its sister virtues of modesty and moderation, has long been a hot topic for hit plays and best-selling novels.In this course, we will see what happens, or doesn’t happen, when men and women try to control women’s (and, less often, men’s) bodies, and when chastising husbands get chastened themselves. We will meet pious “revirginators” and impotent schoolmasters, ice princesses and coy mistresses, cuckolds and cads, and multiple virgins who turn into trees. We will ask what cultural obsessions with preserving sexual purity have to do with discourses of public morality, public health, and environmentalism. We will try not to get frustrated when texts don’t easily surrender their meanings, and we will even try to think of reading as something other than forcing texts to give something up to us.This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on the salutary self-chastening process of revision, and students will be asked to complete short creative writing assignments as well as formal analytical essays.Potential texts include:Aristophanes, LysistrataSophocles, Oedipus the KingOvid, MetamorphosesKempe, The Book of Margery KempeShakespeare, OthelloMilton, ComusMolière, The School for WivesLafayette, The Princess of ClèvesGoethe, Elective AffinitiesJoyce, “A Painful Case”Lorca, The House of Bernarda AlbaDiaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Waoselected poems by Ronsard, Shakespeare, Donne, Herrick, Marvell,Shelley, HopkinsFilm:Sembène, Xala (1975)Heckerling, Clueless (1995)Herzog, Grizzly Man (2005)

																	In this course we will explore literary and cinematic utopias and dystopias in a handful of Euro-American, Middle Eastern, and African texts. How have writers in different times and places articulated their hopes and fears regarding inequality and the possibility of justice? How did the texts’ historical context and aesthetic form influence the theories of society that they present? Paying attention to the role that gender, race, class, and geography play in forming our texts’ particular futurisms, we’ll also ask whether their imagined worlds are useful for addressing issues of inequality and injustice in our own.Possible texts include:Thomas More, UtopiaSonallah Ibrahim, The CommitteeToni Morrison, ParadisePossible film screenings include:Clips from the Disney films Zootopia and MoanaMetropolis, dir.

																	This is a course about changing one’s mind: about revolutions, conversions, voltas, and plot twists, and about what happens when we sit and stare. Afraid she was no longer there, and eager to see her,the lover turned his eyes.                                                —Ovid, MetamorphosisPish! Noses, ears, and lips? Is’t possible?—OthelloThis is a course about changing one’s mind: about revolutions, conversions, voltas, and plot twists, and about what happens when we sit and stare. Beginning with the classical myth of Orpheus and Eurydice and moving forward historically to texts and films by (among others) Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Nella Larsen, Clarice Lispector, and Alfred Hitchcock we’ll ask: When and why do we turn around? Does it have something to do with the mystery of the face, with what it reveals and conceals? What histories are contained there? What lost or hidden identities are obscured? What is the relationship between a personal experience and the public face we present to the world? Why do we sometimes put on a new face? How do our ideas of gender and race determine how we “read” the faces of others? What are the ethics of looking back or looking away?As we move between literature, film, and visual artworks, these questions will give us an opportunity to think critically about form. We’ll learn how to close read across various media—photographs and paintings as well plays and poems. Attending to the way in which changes of direction structure both texts and images, we’ll discuss how these “about-faces” also produce moments of ambiguity.All along our investigation will be shaped by practice: the course’s emphasis is on reading and rereading, writing and re-writing. Thus assignments will be aimed at developing students’ powers of description, persuasion, and argumentation. They will include two short close-reading papers, two longer essays, a presentation, and a number of short writing assignments.A course reader will contain Ovid’s and Virgil’s versions of “Orpheus & Eurydice”; “Love” by Clarice Lispector; poetry by Shakespeare and Baudelaire; selections from Ruth Ozeki’s The Face and John Berger’s Ways of Seeing; plus selected chapters of Writing Analytically and other writing guides.Longer Required Texts (available at the Cal Student Store*):Nella Larsen, PassingMarjane Satrapi, Persepolis (Volume 1)William Shakespeare, Othello and Twelfth NightOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray We will watch a handful of films to be selected from the following: Alfred Hitchcock, VertigoPreston Sturges, The Lady EveDouglas Sirk, Imitation of LifeReinhold Schünzel, Viktor / ViktoriaBlake Edwards, Victor / VictoriaMankiewicz, All About EveBarbet Schroeder, Single White Female And we will also look at a selection of paintings and photographs by: Diane ArbusGiuseppe ArcimboldoCaravaggioHannah HöchAugust Sander *Wherever you choose to purchase your books, please buy the specific edition on order in the university bookstore.  Please obtain hard copies (as opposed to e-books) of all required course texts.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Our course takes up its task of developing critical reading and writing skills through an exploration of literature in terms of two interrelated categories: the actual and the possible. That means we will investigate what set of facts is available and operative in the world of a story or a work of literature—e.g., who the characters are, what happens, where, when, and why things take place—and thus ask how it is we come to know (or think we know) these things through language. At the same time, we will attempt to account for our experience in terms of what linguistic, narrative, and/or rhetorical strategies get used by literature to instill a sense of what is possible in a particular work—e.g., what the rules of its world are, what narratological and thematic possibilities are activated, operative, and unique to it—and how that sense of possibility shapes our experience of the work as whole. Structuring our thinking about literature in terms of its exercises of the actual and the possible is a means of getting into view how different literary works engender expectations in readers, what role expectations play in our experience of literature, and, finally, what claims a work of literature may be making about the roles of reason and the imagination in literary expression.In our course, we will frame our conversation about the actual and the possible largely around the topic of literature’s creation and manipulation of expectations. These could be expectations with regards to plot, character, event, world-picture, physical laws, or any other arena where expectations are at play in literature. A central goal of our investigations will be to test the categories of the actual and the possible as the two major dimensions whose interaction engenders expectations in readers. Possible questions or topics for discussion may include how our sense of ‘what is’ acts as a limiting force on our sense of ‘what is possible’ for a work of literature or, conversely, how our sense of what could be regulates our view of what is. Careful attention will be paid to tracking moments when reader’s expectations are broken, subverted, or defied (which sometimes turns out to be the moment we realize we had expectations in the first place!).Furthermore, we will endeavor to characterize moments when a literary work breaks from our expectations in terms of the disjuncture between what is and what is possible: when a work of literature subverts expectations, we are reminded of the non-identity between the actual and the possible. In literature, sometimes what is possible operates independently from what is, and sometimes what turns out to be the case in a literary work defies all expectations of what could possibly be.As an R&C course, sustained critical engagement with the process of writing will guide our intellectual exploration of the actual and the possible in literature. As a class, we will work together to form an understanding of the partnership between careful reading and analytical writing as well as the relationship of re-writing to writing. With these goals in mind, the first several weeks of class will be dedicated to an intensive introduction to the practice of close reading and arguments structured around close reading before an in-depth analysis of the literary works on the syllabus is pursued.Throughout the semester members of our course will illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, free-writing exercises, online blog discussion posts, creative in-class exercises, and consistent in-class participation. Working closely with Rosenwasser’s Writing Analytically, students will participate in weekly writing workshops, in which skill sets related to the practice of analytical reading and writing will be detailed and developed. Attention will also be paid to differences in critical approaches to works of literature from different genres.Required texts:Virginia Woolf, To the LighthouseMarilynne Robinson, HousekeepingRequired film screening: Pennies from Heaven)Additional required readings will be available in a course reader and include short fiction by E.T.A. Hoffmann, Franz Kafka, and Eudora Welty, excerpts from Robert Musil’s novel The Man without Qualities, excerpts from Miguel Cervantes’s work Don Quixote, and a selection of sermons by Meister Eckhart (i.e., Eckhart von Hochheim).Chapters and excerpts from David Rosenwasser and Jill Stephen’s Writing Analytically will also be provided.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	“The word ‘translation’ comes, etymologically, from the Latin for ‘bearing across.’  Having been borne across the world, we are translated men.” –Salman Rushdie, “Imaginary Homelands”What is translation?  The term is often used to indicate anything transferred, adapted, communicated, displaced, or interpreted. What does it mean when something is “lost in translation”?  What is the difference between a translator and an author?  Why are some texts considered “untranslatable”? In this class we will examine translation as a creative process that bears meaning from one language to another, and think about the wide variety of metaphors implied by the term. We will also examine the figure of the translator in a broad range of literary texts and films in an effort to understand how translation, as a metaphor and a practice, enables movement, transferal, transformation, adaptation, interpretation, but also loss.In addition to our examination of the figures and metaphors of translation, this class will approach translation as an analytical tool of comparison and close reading.  Over the course of the semester we will read many works of literature in translation and perform close comparative analyses of various versions of the same translated passages.  In performing these comparative analyses we will think about translation as a model of close reading, a way of getting to know the text from the inside out. Since our focus in this class will be to hone our analytical reading and writing skills, translation will also provide us with a model of how to make interpretative claims about the meaning of a text in an engaged, creative, and productive way.Texts and films for the course will be selected from the following:Italo Calvino, If On A Winter’s Night a TravelerBrian Friel, TranslationsVassilis Alexakis, Foreign WordsNicole Krauss, The History of LoveMiguel de Cervantes, Don QuixoteBen Lerner, Leaving Atocha StationVladimir Nabokov, PninJorge Luis Borges, Collected FictionsWeinberger and Paz, Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang WeiAmara Lakhous, Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza VittorioSofia Coppola, Lost in TranslationWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Marianne Kaletzky and Emily LaskinFandom gets a bad name in the academic world. Literary scholars pride themselves on their analytical approach to, and critical distance from, works already recognized as high art. Fans, on the other hand, throw themselves into the least esteemed genres and forms.Yet scholarship can’t entirely shake its ties to fandom. The history of the Western novel begins with a fan, Don Quixote, who devotes his life to the seventeenth-century equivalent of a Star Trek convention: dressing up as a character from the stories he loves. Many texts beloved by scholars have their origins in fandom, with authors so fascinated by their predecessors that they reinterpret their work. And literary criticism, no matter how objective it may seem, always depends on a reader’s often emotional, sometimes fanatical attachment to a text. So what’s the difference between a work of fan fiction and an artistic reinterpretation? And where’s the boundary between a fan and a critic?This course will explore fandom as both a literary theme and a literary habit. Some texts we’ll read are populated by obsessive fans who can’t stop referencing their favorite works; other texts are themselves obsessive fans who can’t stop referencing their favorite works. The majority of our readings fall into both categories.Since this is an R&C course, we’ll devote most of our time to close reading and intensive writing. The course will develop students’ abilities to read texts carefully, to examine both points of coherence and moments of tension within them, and to analyze the relationship between meaning and textual form. Its other major aim is to help students express increasingly complex ideas in writing. The various writing activities in the class, from the major analytical essays to shorter creative exercises, will connect critical thinking and writing, improve students’ control over their writing voice, and introduce new ways of thinking about structure and development.Required books:

R. Lorenz & J. NelsenIn this course, we will read stories of people seduced away from a well-balanced life by the allures of beauty, art, revenge, sex, sentiment—or even by rational thought pushed to extremes. Although we could label these characters as mentally ill, many of the texts we will read portray their deviance as an ambiguous sort of exaltation. Accordingly, we will analyze how each text presents the terrible costs of losing grip, as well as how the characters, from the point of view of their extreme principles, offer a twisted justification for the unbalanced life.These texts will offer stimulating material for the primary aim of the course, which is to teach you how to write convincing essays filled with intelligent analysis and argument. A considerable amount of class time will thus be devoted explicitly to writing instruction, so that you can exit the course with some well-honed and very useful practical skills. As in all R & C courses, 32 pages of writing are required, including first drafts and rewrites.Texts:Euripides, MedeaE.T.A.

Ashley Brock and Jordan BulgerContemporary debates about social matters often turn to nature to decide them.  Parties debating a common issue will attempt a familiar gesture: each will claim that its position is natural and therefore true. Why would an appeal to nature decide a social issue and what relationship between society and nature does this appeal assume?This course will consider what literature can contribute to an understanding of nature and society and their relationship.  While mining the literatures of disparate times and places, we will explore the implications of different modes of seeing the relationship between the natural and the human: as one of opposition, continuity, determinacy, etc. We will also consider the multiplicity of “natures” that have been generated in different cultural contexts, historical moments, and individual situations.As we consider nature from the various vantage points offered by our literary texts, you will be encouraged to think about the argumentative appropriation of nature in contemporary debates: gender, race, class, sexual orientation; development versus conservation; local versus global; old versus new; science versus religion; man versus animal; and individual versus collective.In addition to focusing on the ways in which nature and society appear within the texts, we will also examine the role of fiction in shaping our cultural values and public policies with regards to nature. Why would one choose the written word as an approach to the natural world in the first place? What can literature do that other ways of thinking about nature cannot? Most urgently, what kind of solutions or insights can literature offer to those of us trying to address problems and tensions in the world beyond the written page?Throughout the semester, we will ask how reading about fictional worlds can be a means of better understanding our lived world: how do the situations and characters we encounter in the texts invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and decisions? In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument.Reading List may include:Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps

We will examine classic attempts to say what makes a good story and analyze strategies that writers, dramatists, and filmmakers use to draw in their readers. Students will be introduced to the concept of the genre and will be asked to put to the test the idea that each genre has certain “rules” that make it successful.

In this class, we will consider texts that present ‘re-visions’ of earlier texts through adaptation and intertextuality.  What new critical perspectives emerge when all or part of a narrative is redistributed in a different context?  How do factors such as a change in genre, a change in historical or cultural context, or even a change in the gender of the author create a unique dialogue between earlier texts and later re-visions of them, and what critical purpose does this dialogue serve in each case?  For example, we will consider the relationship between Charles Perrault’s seventeenth-century fairy tales and Angela Carter’s postmodern feminist versions of them.  We will also consider Carter’s intertextual use of the violent pornography of the Marquis de Sade.  What do the genres of fairy tale and pornography have in common?  How do Carter’s re-visions develop interesting arguments about both?All of the main texts on the syllabus were written by female authors, and a majority of the pre-texts were written by male authors.  Questions concerning gender will therefore guide part of our inquiry into literary re-vision.  Women spent ages on the margins of the authorial literary landscape, though they were frequently the subjects of men’s stories.  In some traditions, the female body itself has been associated with rhetorical artifice, both frequently considered in need of regulation and control by men, as the male-authored texts on this syllabus will demonstrate.  How have female authors re-treated women through literary revision?  Specifically how have they re-treated the female body?  In what ways might revising texts written by males be seen as an assertion of women’s intellectual authority? (‘Author’ comes from the Latin auctor, a person who was once considered to possess auctoritas, or ‘authority.’)  What limits on such an assertion are posed by speaking from within the confines of previously written texts?With respect to the medieval and early modern texts on the syllabus, we will also consider how issues pertaining to textual criticism relate to the main questions guiding this class.  How is our modern conception of a ‘text’ altered by considering the fact that numerous medieval manuscripts and early modern printed editions offer different versions of the same story?  How did the simultaneous circulation of multiple versions of the same story inform medieval and early modern reading practices, and how do modern editors grapple with the ‘problem’ of multiple versions?  We will consider how these questions, seemingly unique to medieval and early modern textual matters, actually provide a basis upon which to formulate interesting questions about modern adaptation and intertextuality.We will explore the topics above through active class discussion and intensive writing and essay revision. Main texts, with earlier versions and influences in parentheses, include:CL R1A:2

J.Greenwald & M. KaletzkyWhere does literature take place? We usually think of setting as a mundane element that we briefly acknowledge before moving on to the more compelling features of plot and character. This course will move setting from the background to the foreground.Our class takes place in Nowheresville or, as the narrator of Don Quixote declares, “a place whose name I do not wish to remember.”Our reading will take us on a journey through the podunk towns and provincial backwaters of Mexico, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Ireland.

A. GadberrySuppose you and a friend are at your house when a murderer rings your doorbell. You answer the door, and the murderer asks if your friend is inside. (The murderer would like to murder your friend.)Do you lie?Our course will begin by reflecting on the scenario above (and Kant’s famous response to it). As we read novels, poems, plays, short stories, and works of philosophy and literary criticism that deal with lying and liars, we’ll explore the moral and ethical dimensions of the lie. We’ll meet those who lie out of desperation and those who love to lie; from hustlers to hoaxsters, from the fraudulent to the fearful, we’ll try to understand how these characters and the texts in which we find them understand the lie and its social and ethical dimensions. How do various forms of “lying” challenge (or presuppose) established truths? What kind of affective states (anxiety or cunning, for instance) do our texts associate with lying, and how might the emotional landscape around the lie and liars impact the decision to lie (or not)? How does literature understand its own production of fiction in relationship to dissimulation, deceit, or concealment? And finally, how does the lie forge relationships both between “truth” and fiction and between people and the social world? Are there necessary lies?Intensive reading and active class participation is a requirement for this course. Written assignments will include several critical essays and revisions as well as some shorter creative and analytical responses. Students should also anticipate a couple of quizzes and a presentation.Required Readings (N.B.: Please do not purchase the texts until the first day of class.

A. BrockWhat family isn’t steeped in lore, haunted by skeletons in the closet, or delighted by its own humorous anecdotes no matter how many times they’ve been told? In this class we will explore the singular relationship between the family and story telling. What is the relationship between family, identity, memory, and narrative? To what extent do the stories that are passed down through our families shape who we are and determine what kind of a world we inherit? What is the importance of unearthing, reconstructing, telling, and re-telling the stories of how our families came to be?These are some of the questions we will address while examining texts from a wide range of time periods and cultural traditions. In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument. To this end, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling argumentative paper.Required Texts (Available for purchase at the bookstore unless otherwise indicated):Sophocles Oedipus the KingShakespeare, William King LearLispector, Clarice Family Ties (selections)*Russ, Joana “Autobiography of my Mother”*Faulkner, William The Sound and the FuryJones, Gayl CorregidoraSatrapi, Marjane Chicken with PlumsAlexie, Sherman War Dances (selections)*Will be available on bspace in the Resources folder (you do not need to purchase these texts)Com Lit R1A:3

According to the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, we live in “the best of all possible worlds.”  Whether or not that’s true, it hasn’t prevented us from ceaselessly imagining – or even creating – alternate realities: shiny fantasy worlds where our most cherished dreams come true or, when we’re feeling less optimistic, nightmarish dystopias where they are mercilessly crushed.  What constitutes a possible world or parallel universe?  How and why is it constructed?  By what rules is it governed?  Who or what inhabits it?  Where is it located in time and space – in our own backyard or in a distant galaxy, amidst our personal memories or a thousand years into the future?  How does it bring the “real world” – whatever that might be – into relief?  These are some of the questions we’ll be asking as we survey the possibilities and parallels presented by poets, photographers, filmmakers, novelists, and science fiction writers.As this is a writing intensive course, a significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing a total of three papers: a two-page diagnostic essay and two longer essays, both of which require substantial revisions.  The final paper will incorporate independent research.  In addition, there will be a number of shorter assignments designed to hone your skills as critical readers and writers.

A. TranWayne Booth has argued that “the history of unreliable narrators from Gargantua to Lolita is in fact full of traps for the unsuspecting reader.”  In this course, we will investigate these “traps” of narration and discuss whether an objective, “reliable” representation of reality is possible. We will look at the complexities of narration in fiction and film by first asking how we define the nature of truth and reality.  Is truth an objective viewpoint on our world or a set of subjective interpretations?  What role does ‘lying’ play in society, and why might it be problematic that a text is told from the perspective of a biased or deceptive narrator?  In what ways does the overt subjectivity of an unreliable narrator complicate our understanding of the text?  We will explore how issues of perspective affect our perception of truth and reality by examining a wide range of novels, short stories, and films that problematize in different ways this question of narrative reliability. This class includes writing exercises and two formal papers, and places strong emphasis on active student participation.

M. Bhaumik & P. BritoThis class examines the intersection between technology, poetry and aesthetic form from ancient to contemporary works.  Although the idea of technology now appears in separation from art, the concept of techné in classical times is intricately woven with art.  We will begin by pursuing the ethical questions raised in classical texts on how technology impacts everyday life, politics and aesthetics.  A majority of the class will be spent on late modern and post-modern representations of technology, reflecting on how mechanical reproduction reshapes perceptions of city-space, communication, nature, utopia, war, and work.  Our class will probe how mechanical reproduction (printing presses, photography, film) not only impacts narrative forms but also increasingly regulates aesthetic experience.  We will then spend time reading about new forms of media, engaging with contemporary postmodern and science fiction texts foregrounding digital and cyber culture’s role in daily life.  The ancient question will persist, however, about how technology and new media intersect with modes of reading.Mary Shelley, FrankensteinRicardo Piglia, Respiración artificialPhilip K.

Ruth LorenzThis course will give you a taste of one of the most enduring debates surrounding literary fictions while also providing a solid introduction to analytical thinking and writing. The texts we’ll be reading, drawn from the English, Russian, German and Classical Greek traditions, will offer arguments and experiments that explore what happens when literature aspires to represent reality—whatever “reality” might be. Does fiction decieve readers or enlighten them? Does it cater to our preconceived notions or challenge them? What distortions are embedded in the literary reflection? We will explore these questions and more in readings and class discussions. These discussions will in turn be the backdrop to a sustained examination of the skills involved in writing argumentative essays. The course will offer direction in how to generate an argument, how to structure a paper and how to express yourself with clarity. You will leave the course with more insight into the truths and lies of fiction and with a honed ability to write elegantly and effectively.Texts will include:Plato, The Republic (selections)Aristotle, PoeticsTurgenev, Fathers and SonsBrecht, Life of GalieiWoolf, Mrs. DallowayBarthes, S/Z (selections)Comp Lit R1A:4

S.  ChihayaBooks are tricky. They can be seductive, persuasive, misleading– though we may not always realize it, reading can be a dangerous pastime. Over the course of the semester, we will examine several texts that engage with the problems and pitfalls of reading; whether the dangers of reading are implicit or explicit in each, all of them ask us to consider the intimate relationship between book and reader. By turns eerie, puzzling, and comic, these works demand that we consider our own experiences as readers and participants in the imagined worlds of texts.We will explore these texts through discussion, class presentations, and written assignments. Over the course of the semester, students will learn to hone their critical skills and individual prose styles through a series of analytical and creative assignments in order to become more confident and capable readers and writers.Texts will be chosen from the following:Charlotte Lennox, The Female QuixoteIan McEwan, AtonementGustave Flaubert, Madame BovaryItalo Calvino, If on a winter’s night a traveler…Jorge Luis Borges, “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote”Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (selections)Christopher Marlowe, Dr. FaustusVladimir Nabokov, Pale FireHenry James, The Aspern PapersRoland Barthes, Le Plaisir du Texte (selections)Walter Benjamin, “The Storyteller: Reflections on the Works of Nikolai Leskov”Comp Lit R1A:4

S. Cochran Every day in Berkeley we pass individuals who are so eccentric, so strange, so “out there,” that we often call them (without reflection) “crazy.”  But how do we decide between “crazy” and “unique”—between  those who might be considered genuinely “mad” and those who are simply “marching to the beat of their own drum”?  In this course we will consider madness in its many forms and characterizations in literature, film, and visual art.  Our study, however, will not be of madness itself so much as the way it exemplifies the close connection, for all of us, between what we see and the imaginative lens through which we see it.We will meet Don Quixote who, pathetic or profound, sees a world that is precisely as romantic as he wishes it to be, and a Little Prince who knows for certain, when looking at a sketch of a wooden box with holes, that inside that box is a live sheep. We’ll listen to the townspeople, in “The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World,” as they re-imagine the village they thought they knew in the course of telling to each other the likely story of the dead body that washes up one day on their beach.  We will watch as the narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper” encounters successive new versions of herself in the paper that covers her room.As we examine the texts before us we will consider how the process of reading fiction and of viewing art is also an exercise of the imagination: the worlds and characters we “see” before us are worlds and characters we ourselves, in part, create.  What does it mean to read?  What is the place and the process of interpretation?  And how do our interpretations of art impact the world we encounter and the self we create as we leave the classroom?  Is reading any less a process of intellectual creation than the one of writing: that exercise by which we give form and shape to our interpretations—represent and communicate to others what we see in the art we analyze?This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, and interpretation.Written Texts:Euripides, The BacchaeMary Shelley, FrankensteinCervantes, Don Quixote (selections)Charlotte Perkins Gilman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”W.B.

J. RaischIn this course, we will be examining a number of texts that tell the story of being lost: at sea, in labyrinths, in time. In thinking about how being lost functions as mode of story-telling, we will necessarily spend time also thinking about travel narratives and the genre of fantasy. What is it about “the wrong-turn” or “the shipwreck” that so captures our imagination? How does going the wrong way allow us construct other worlds and better understand our own? Beginning with the prototypal journey of Homer’s Odysseus, we will trace lost travelers from Lemuel Gulliver to Dorothy and Toto to the ensemble cast of J. J. Abram’s influential television show.

Gregory Bonetti“History takes on meaning only in the stations of its agony and decay.” –Walter BenjaminWhen we think of decay, we might imagine a natural process of decomposition, in which complex organisms break down into simpler forms of matter.  Biologists would have us believe that this is Nature’s divine law, which not only forces man, plant, and beast to return to the dust from which they came, but also to ensure a vital reinvigoration of new life forms.  To decay, therefore, means to lose one’s original, healthy form and disintegrate into a substance that benefits that which will follow in our stead.  The subject of decay is thus situated on the boundary line of life and death, an intermediate moment in which the old—be it an individual, an object, or a form—tries to retain its existence, but ends up only slowing down the inevitable progress towards its own internal annihilation.As we will see throughout the semester, literature has continually taken up the question of decay, precisely because of its transitional nature between the old and the new, forces that come to clash in a scene of vivid decomposition.  Our approach will be threefold: we will begin by investigating works that see decay as a form of divine punishment, in direct opposition to the ideals of goodness and virtue.  Next, we will read a variety of texts that see decay as a moment of possibility instead of damnation, in which older forms are appreciated most vividly in their last throes of life.  In our third section, we will consider the place of decay in discussions of political modernity following the First World War.As a class, we will try to see how the concept of decay changes significantly depending on the social, historical, and literary context in which it is used.  Given our wide variety of texts—ranging from Greek plays to totalitarian journals—we will be well equipped to critically explore the literary art of decay.Many of the texts include sexually explicit, or otherwise graphic, material.  If there are any questions, please contact the instructor at bonetti@berkeley.edu.Texts will provisionally include the following:The Bible (Reader)Sophocles, Oedipus RexShakespeare, MacbethRacine, Phèdre Mary Shelley, Frankenstein Leopold Sacher-Masoch, Venus in FursOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray Adolf Hitler, selection from Mein Kampf (Reader)Tomasi di Lampedusa, The LeopardFilm: Alfred Hitchcock, The BirdsBesides excerpted texts, the course reader will also include a number of writing exercises.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

J. RaischAlthough originally coined as a medical condition (literally “homesickness”), nostalgia has come to describe a usually harmless, and deeply sentimental, longing for the past. In this class, we’ll think about the transformation of this concept from the medical to the emotional, as well as its connection to ideas of both home and history. Just how harmless is nostalgia? Does nostalgia keep us grounded and attached to where we come from or does its sentimentality necessarily distort our vision? What is it about an unattainable time or place that seems so appealing? By reading texts and viewing films that either represent nostalgia at work or are clearly employing a nostalgic lens, we’ll think, discuss, and write about what provokes nostalgia and why.Texts and films will include:Homer, OdysseyWilliam Shakespeare, The TempestMarcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time (selections)Steven Spielberg, Jurassic ParkGary Ross, PleasantvilleWoody Allen, Midnight in Paris And a course reader will additionally include selections from: Ovid, Hesiod, Theocritus, Joachim Du Bellay, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, William Wordsworth, Novalis, Alfred Lord Tennyson, various Pre-Raphaelites, and Sigmund Freud. Comp Lit R1A:6

L. RamosWhat is world literature? In this reading and writing intensive course, we will examine works of literature not simply as products of their local environment, but rather, as windows into global cultural relations.  In other words, we will uncover how writers imagine a world beyond their immediate circumstances by situating their work in an international context. Beginning with the concept’s origins in Goethe and Marx, we will read works that reveal an understanding of the world as a planetary order in concert and in conflict and as a geopolitical space of antagonisms and alliances. By closely examining texts that dramatize the relation between the local and the global in its manifold manifestations (center versus periphery, metropole versus colony, north versus south and private versus public), our aim will be to unsettle common assumptions about the nation as the primary locus of literary enunciation. However, rather than subscribe to a cosmopolitan view divorced from history or politics, we will strive precisely to reveal both the perils and the promise, both the pitfalls and possibilities inherent in the exchange between cultures across national boundaries.Texts:The Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Kingdom of this World, Alejo CarpentierHeart of Darkness, Joseph ConradSeason of Migration to the North, Tayeb SalihAutobiography of My Mother, Jamaica KincaidFilms:Happy Together, Wong Kar WaiBabel, Alejandro González IñarrituCourse Reader:A course reader that includes short stories, poetry, essays and criticism by Goethe, Marx, Borges, Dereck Walcott, Alejo Carpentier, George Lamming, Gayatri Spivak and David Damrosch will be available to be purchased the first day of class at Metro Publishers, 2440 Bancroft Way, (510) 644-1999. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	“A woman’s body does a thousand different things, toils, runs, studies, fantasizes, invents, wearies, and meanwhile the breasts enlarge, the lips of the sex swell, the flesh throbs with a round life that is yours, your life, and yet pushes elsewhere, draws away from you although it inhabits your belly, joyful and weighty, felt as a greedy impulse and yet repellent, like an insect’s poison injected into a vein.”-Elena Ferrante, The Lost DaughterCourse Description:For this course, we will explore texts that elaborate on motherhood as a multidimensional experience and that challenge the idea of the archetypal mother, a woman who supports and nurtures her children, often at the expense of her individual identity. As we interpret these works, we will consider questions including, but not limited to the following: What does it mean to be a mother? At what cost does one become a mother? What does one lose and what does one gain? How do literary and theoretical texts portray the ways in which a mother negotiates her multiple identities as woman, as partner, as laborer, as mother, as sexual being, as individual? What role does society play in shaping one’s identity as a mother? How do societal expectations work to censor a mother’s articulation of her experience? What kinds of mothers exist other than biological mothers? How do the concepts of “othermothering” and community mothering play into the idea of motherhood in these texts? Can acts of violence and of abandonment also be considered acts of love? How do these texts complicate the archetypal maternal figure?We will consider a selection of texts, including film, that span across time, geography, and genre. We will read scholarly articles as well as works of literature. As this is a Reading and Composition course, one of our primary goals will be to build and to refine your ability to construct a cogent analytical argument about a literary text and to support your argument using textual evidence. You will write a total of 36 pages that will consist of various formal writing assignments throughout the semester. You will read 100-150 pages of literary and scholarly texts per week.Possible Course Texts:Allison, Dorothy – Bastard Out of CarolinaAlmodóvar, Pedro – All About My Mother and Volver (films)Atwood, Margaret – The Handmaid’s TaleBechdel, Alison – Are You My Mother?Crialese, Emanuele – Respiro (film)Claudel, Philippe – I’ve Loved You So Long (film)Euripides – MedeaFerrante, Elena – The Lost DaughterGuadagnino, Luca – I Am Love (film)Marazzi, Alina – For One More Hour with You (film)Morrison, Toni – BelovedO’Reilly, Andrea – selections from Maternal Theory: Essential ReadingsPasolini, Pier Paolo – Mamma Roma (film)Polanski, Roman – Rosemary’s Baby (film)A note on the material:In this course, we will explore sensitive topics that include sexual abuse, racial violence, drug addiction, and suicide.

How does queer cinema and performance deviate from and rework key themes of ritual? How does the performance of ritual provide the conditions for us to recognize certain lives as grievable, certain relations as kinship, and certain bodies as human? The course will focus on literature, film, and theory from Ancient and Modern Greek contexts, as well as European and North American ones, in order to question continuities, translations, and ruptures in ritual and its contexts. Placing literature and film in conversation with scholarship from the disciplines of anthropology, psychoanalysis, and history, the course will emphasize the skills of close reading and argumentation within a comparative framework. This is a writing-intensive R1B course with a research component. A substantial amount of time will be devoted to writing workshops and instruction. Students will be required to write papers with revisions.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	What are human rights? How did this concept begin and where? How can literature and media engage with human rights as a discourse and a practice? How do Latina/o/x, Native American and African-American writers and artists engage with human rights discourses in their works? In this course we will be reading/viewing texts that deal with the issue of human rights through a variety of genres and media prevailing in the 20-21 st centuries. We will explore how novels, poems, essays, songs, podcasts, and films engage with human rights issues and discourses by construction a template for narrative empathy in the United States and beyond. Furthermore, we will investigate how these genres and media use modernist and postmodernist aesthetics in order to directly engage with and reconstruct ideas governing national and cultural identity. In addition to literature and media, we will also read several historical and critical theory pieces by scholars from Gloria Anzaldúa to Lynn Hunt, helping us to understand how Latina/o/x, Native American and African-American literature and media contribute to developing human rights discourses around topics such as immigration, race, sexual identity and historical representation.Possible Books and Course Reader for Purchase:The Mixquiahuala Letters by Ana CastilloTracks by Louise ErdrichThe Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot DíazNote: A course reader with short stories, poems and theory pieces by Ana Castillo, Helena Maria Viramontes, Gloria Anzaldúa, Sherman Alexie, Toni Morrison, Sandra Cisneros, Maya Angelou, Lynn Hunt, and others, will be available for purchase as well.Films (will be made available)El NorteMade in LAMedia (will be made available)Radiolab podcast episode: The Case of Baby VeronicaCourse Objectives Identify how Latina/o/x, Native-American, and African-American writers and artists reflect on issues of human rights through their engagement with power, gender, sexuality, and race dynamics. Think critically about each primary text by employing the skill of analytical close-reading (the use of small details to make a larger point). This includes being able to pull apart and understand the nuances of any text, photo, etc. and use these details to construct a convincing and original argument about the text. Communicate efficiently during in-class discussion and thus developing argumentative and critical thinking skills. Connect the main points of our readings to larger real world contexts. For instance, what are the social, political, and cultural implications of the Latina/o/x/African-American/Native- American texts we encounter? What could they mean for the daily lives of Latina/o/x/ African-American/Native- American people? For our own local and national communities? How do these authors employ an understanding of human rights within their works in order to make a larger political claim?We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	This course will examine a long legacy of cultural fascination with domestic space and its iconic caretaker, the housewife.  We will discuss literary texts and films that feature housewives as protagonists – from Euripides to Virginia Woolf to the present.  Our task will be twofold:  we will work to appreciate, on the one hand, how texts engage with a longstanding (and ongoing) feminist critique of the tethering of women to domestic labor; on the other hand, we will try to understand why the housewife endures as a key aspect of the fantasy of “the good life.”  As the class progresses, we will also think critically about the norm of the housewife as a historical marker of class and racial distinctions.  What can literary representations of housewives tell us about the aspirations and assumptions surrounding our everyday lives – in the past and in the present?This is a writing-intensive course, and we will explore all of these issues as a means of refining writing skills.  Students will write and re-write a number of essays, and writing “workshops” will occur on a regular basis.  The final portion of the course will be spent on developing research skills, and will culminate in a research paper on one of the texts we have studied.Required texts (available at Cal Student Store:  2560 Bancroft Way)Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary (trans.

																	At once setting and subject, geopolitical region and aesthetic construct, the Americas have long captivated cultural imaginations across the globe. But what are we talking about when we talk about the Americas in the plural? To say “I’m American” suggests a certain singularity that disregards the double, continental expanse mapped across a hemisphere. What are the implications of understanding North and South separately and together, or instead, considering multiple Americas? What role might textuality, intertextuality, performance, and translation play in acts of border crossing? If the Americas have been constructed in part by writing and rewriting over history and across traditions, what contemporary possibilities do rewriting and performing the Americas open up? And what are the historical, sociopolitical, and aesthetic consequences of hemispheric and transatlantic thinking?These are but a few of the questions we’ll address as we think about and then rethink the Americas. We’ll travel across borders and centuries, at once constructing and deconstructing these linguistic, cultural, and geographic zones. We’ll consider how poems, plays, lyrics, novels, films, and performances both illuminate and are illuminated by hemispheric and transatlantic thinking. Generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, this course will include the opportunity to attend three shows at Cal Performances and engage with teaching artists across multiple mediums. Crucial to our consideration of multiple Americas will be a more expansive understanding of what constitutes a text: from listening to Argentine tango to becoming part of Camille Brown’s linguistic play to performing our own Americas, we will think, write, and rewrite across generic and geographic borders. And as we investigate the words we read and the performances we attend, so too will we scrutinize the words we write. We’ll explore the many choices, both simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating interpretations of a text to a reader.As a Reading & Composition course, sustained critical engagement with the process of writing will guide our intellectual consideration of multiple Americas. A series of writing activities will help us conceptualize how writing is fundamentally social: a tool with agency to engage in conversation, as well as a mode of expression, experience, and action. As a class community, we’ll work toward developing ties between a practice of close reading and a practice of writing.Required Texts: Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot Gabriel García Márquez’s El Coronel No Tiene Quien Le Escriba (No One Writes to the Colonel) A course reader must be purchased at Krishna Copy (2001 University Ave.). It contains prose selections by Valeria Luiselli, Jorge Luis Borges, Clarice Lispector, Gloria Anzaldúa, Edgar Allen Poe, Julio Cortázar, Silvina Ocampo, and Maggie Nelson; with poetry by Audre Lorde, Eileen Myles, Walt Whitman, Langston Hughes, Allen Ginsberg, Federico García Lorca, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Gabriela Mistral, and Pablo Neruda; an article on the films of Pedro Almodóvar; travel writing by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Victoria Ocampo, Charles Darwin and Jonathan Franzen; selections of critical texts and essays by Mary Louise Pratt, Judith Butler, and Hilton Als; and readings on writing by Stanley Fish and from Writing Analytically.Required Films, Performances, and Events: Todo Sobre Mi Madre (All About My Mother) directed by Pedro Almodóvar Théâtre de la Ville’s production of Camus’s State of Siege Tango Buenos Aires’s Spirit of Argentina Camille Brown’s BLACK GIRL: Linguistic PlayWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Literary traditions have developed and continually redefined the often complex relations between author, poet, narrator, character, and reader in literature.“An excellent poet – who is called divine for no other reason except that by working like the supreme Artificer he comes to share in his divinity – can shape a poem in which, as in a little world, we read of mustering armies, land and sea battles, conquests of cities,… drought and starvation, tempests, fires, prodigies;… and see sedition, discord, wanderings, adventures, enchantments, cruelty, boldness, courtesy, kindness, and love – sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes joyous, sometimes pitiful.”– Torquato Tasso, 1544-1595Literary traditions have developed and continually redefined the often complex relations between author, poet, narrator, character, and reader in literature. The author implicates himself in the narrative intentionally or unintentionally, offering overt or subtle commentaries, opinions, digressions, or self-reflections. The first person narration proves biased, unreliable, limited in the perspective of the storyteller. Even the “omniscient,” godlike voice can be destabilized by the poet’s subjectivity or self-conscious awareness of herself. So, how does the poet figure into his poem, the author into her text? In a given piece of literature, are there clear relationships between author, narrator, poet-persona, and the world, space, and characters of their texts? What kind of (divine) insight does the narrator claim to have, and how does her authorial voice affect the characters of the text? How does the poem as a place of communication between these authorial figures and their readers become a space for such exchange? We will begin our exploration into these questions around the literary figure of the poet-persona with Dante’s Inferno, tracing the “poet-pilgrim” relationship that governs the narrative of the otherworldly descent, and examining both the author’s self-fashioning as a voice of authority within the poetic space that he constructs, and the divine inspiration with which he purports to write. Using our understanding of Inferno as an essential foundation, we will read a range of literary works that develop the role and agenda of the poet/narrator/author within the text; the space of the text as meta-poetic, spectacular, and/or theatrical; and the problem of narrative claims of insight, which can successfully suspend (our) disbelief or else culminate in the limits of sight and the failure of language. Additional texts may include selections from authors such as Plato, Aristotle, Virgil, Francis Petrarch, François Rabelais, Michel de Montaigne, Christopher Marlowe, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Franz Kafka, Tom Stoppard, and Marguerite Duras. Course ObjectivesWhile these questions and proposed texts will furnish us with material for rich discussions, this class is chiefly geared toward improving your analytical writing skills. We will concentrate on both mechanics and style, learning how to read closely, formulate interesting arguments, gather evidence, and organize claims into persuasive essays. Over the course of the semester, you will produce approximately 32 pages of written work through a gradual process of drafting, editing, reviewing, and revising. The assignments will also include shorter close reading papers, in-class reading quizzes, and a research paper, satisfying the R1B course requirement. We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	What makes a home? Is it an apartment? A native country? Or something less tangible—a feeling or a thought? In this course, we’ll devote close attention to a series of texts that address these and related questions. In the first half of the semester we’ll examine stories about building homes, thinking through the way these texts depict physical space, and what those spaces mean to us and to the stories that contain them. In the second half of the semester we’ll hit the road, considering travel accounts and fiction that focus on leaving—or sometimes destroying—homes. During this part of the course we’ll ask about homes that are bigger than houses, and about being homeless. We’ll consider what it means to be traveling or on the road. And we’ll consider space again, this time thinking about how texts depict unfamiliar places.Since this an R&C course, its major aim is to help students develop their prowess as readers, writers, and thinkers. We’ll spend time learning tools for building effective analytical arguments as well as tactics for expressing those arguments clearly in writing. In addition to several essays over the course of the semester and reading assignments for each class, students can expect to complete regular short homework assignments as well as participate frequently in class discussions.Possible texts include:Sherman Alexie, “Traveling”Isaac Babel, “My First Goose”Willa Cather, My AntoniaWilliam Least Heat-Moon, Blue Highways (selection)Homer, The Odyssey (selection)Rudyard Kipling, KimMikhail Lermontov, A Hero of Our TimeDavid Mackenzie, Hell or High WaterToni Morrison, BelovedKelly Reichardt, Night MovesMarilynne Robinson, HousekeepingWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Utopian hope often meets an insistence on some fixed idea of human nature. Demands for greater freedom and equality are countered by “realistic” estimations of how much order and hierarchy we must bear in order to live together in society. This course will explore this drama of revolutionary desire and reactionary response as it is staged in novels by four women: Mary Shelley, Octavia Butler, Margaret Atwood, and Ann Leckie; as well as in the short stories that Alice Sheldon published under the pen name James Tiptree, Jr. We will read these works of SF—science fiction but also speculative fiction, fiction that’s simultaneously grounded in this world and imagining another—alongside and against different theoretical accounts of what it means to be human. In so doing, we’ll examine the political in the personal; everyday questions of love, sex, friendship, family, work, reproduction, community, and death; and more outlandish scenarios involving monsters, cyborgs, and genetically-engineered creatures, alien encounters, ecological apocalypses, and galactic empires. We will also conduct an extended inquiry into the various forms that present themselves to us as natural, organic wholes, whether they’re selves or societies, poems or novels.As this is a writing course that fulfills the university’s R1B requirement, it will involve both further training in literary analysis—in the communication of an interpretation of a literary text to a reader—and an introduction to writing with sources and responding to scholarly arguments.Texts will include:Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818) by Mary ShelleyDawn (1987) by Octavia ButlerOryx and Crake (2003) by Margaret AtwoodAncillary Justice (2014) by Ann Leckie“The Last Flight of Dr. Ain,” “The Screwfly Solution,” “The Women Men Don’t See,” “Houston, Houston, Do You Read?” “Love is the Plan, the Plan is Death,” and “And I Awoke to Find Me Here on the Cold Hill’s Side” (1970s) by James Tiptree, Jr.Texts will also be drawn from:Philosophy, theory, and essays by Aristotle, Michel de Montaigne, Thomas Hobbes, Jean- Jacques Rousseau, Heinrich von Kleist, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hannah Arendt, Donna J. Haraway, Barbara Johnson, and Judith Butler.Poetry by Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, William Blake, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, César Vallejo, Wallace Stevens, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Marianne Moore Short fiction by E.T.A.

Fictions of Technology, Science and SocietyIn this course we will develop writing and argumentative skills through exploring theoretical and imaginative texts that revolve around technology, science and social order. We will read texts that take up the questions of artificial intelligence and human attachment (Ex-Machina), the relation between justice and techniques of scientific prediction (Foundation, Minority Report), and time travel (The Time Machine) among others. We will watch several contemporary films and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on sci-fi and utopian/distopian fiction. The following questions will underlie a few of our discussions: can humans attach to inanimate machines and if so what do such attachments teach us about relationships with humans? Why are we both fascinated and deeply anxious about the possibility of artificial intelligence such as cyborgs and robots? Why do science and scientific innovation are used as models to imagine perfect societies and why such models usually fail? How do sci-fi texts encode implicit utopian wishes and why is the genre a ripe site for such social thinking?Required BooksIsaac Asimov, Foundation and Empire

Howard Fisher Suppose I asked you to tell me what your friend Stephanie knows about what Jorge thinks about Alan’s opinion about Margaret. How would you structure your response to account not only for the relations between each person, but also for each person’s thoughts? Would your response need four different accounts of four different thoughts, or would those accounts overlap? And in the end, would your account have painted me one picture or a series of pictures?The capacity for reflecting on the thoughts, beliefs, and desires of others – what cognitive scientists call Theory of Mind – intersects with a series of questions about narrative form. In what ways does narrative structure respond to changing historical understandings of mind? How does literature not only respond to trends in cognitive science, but also work through and generate theories of mind? What resources does language possess to pursue the dizzying task of thinking about thinking, believing about believing, and desiring about desiring? What political, erotic, and intellectual interests are served when adult humans undertake similar tasks in relation to children, animals, and differently-abled people?Focusing on literature, philosophy, and research in the cognitive sciences, this course will explore these questions as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Specific units will address the classical unity of mind and spirit, problems of representing mindedness in different narrative forms, and questions of mind in modernism.With these goals in mind, members of this course will be asked to illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, periodic posts to a bcourses forum, and consistent in-class participation.Required Texts:

Gabriel Page & Keith FordMemory is essential for personal and cultural identity; and memory is, for the most part, narratively constructed. Our sense of who we are – as individuals and as members of groups – depends upon the stories we tell about ourselves: stories that establish continuities over time, assign meanings to certain experiences, and create values.  Individual or cultural amnesia signifies a loss of identity, and a dangerous condition of disorientation in the world. But the intimate relationship between memory and narrative raises several pressing epistemological questions. What is the relationship between memory and history, on the one hand, and between memory and fiction on the other? What happens when memory exists in tension (or contradiction) with public history or the historical archive? How does the structuring of memory through narrative forms and conventions affect what is remembered and the meanings that the past holds for us? How does the imperative to remember on occasion come into conflict with the desire or need to forget? In this course we will consider a series of narrative texts – literary and cinematic – that thematize memory and problematize the spaces between memory, history, and invention.  This is a reading and writing intensive course in which students will build on the skills they acquired in R1A. Students will write several essays over the course of the semester and learn how to do research in the field of literary studies.Texts for the course are likely to include selections from The Odyssey and The Aeneid, Petrarch’s “Ascent of Mt. Ventoux,” Absalom, Absalom!, The Storyteller, Dictee, as well as some short stories, poems, and films. Students should not purchase the texts until after we have had our first class meeting.    We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	—Bilbo BagginsInstructor: Keith Ford, keith.ford@berkeley.edu (office hours: Tuesdays 1:00pm to 3pm, and by appointment, at Dwinelle 4414). Before we even set out on a journey, the places we go are invested with meaning and, often, idealized goals. Inevitably, there is a dissonance between destination and dream. Perhaps accounting for this, in literature, many travelers are bound to entirely fictitious destinations. And yet, the fiction is as revealing as any fact when considering why we are driven to travel. What values and expectations does the traveler carry with him, perhaps unwittingly? How are indigenous populations represented? What are the social and political motivations surrounding the writing of travel texts?In order to investigate these and other questions, this course will engage with texts whose treatment of travel ranges from the fantastic (Lucian’s A True History and Apuleius’s The Golden Ass and selections from Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring) to the philosophical and imperial (Thomas More’s Utopia, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, selections from both Thevet’s Singularities of Antarctic France and Lery’s True Voyage to Brazil,) to something foundational to identity itself (Momaday’s The Way to Rainy Mountain, Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks and Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children).This is a reading and writing intensive course with several essay assignments which will build upon the skills acquired in R1A. We will approach academic writing as a process, and
students will articulate clear and interesting arguments about the texts we are studying
while entering the world of literary criticism and learning to integrate and interrogate
criticism in their own writing.Assignments & Grading:

Jennifer Lillie and Adeline TranWhat is advantageous about the vantage point offered from outside the healthy, the normal, the mainstream, the acceptable, the recognized? This course will focus on short stories, novels, and films about outsider figures: geniuses, patients, loners, inmates, hermits, outcasts, foreigners, etc. In doing so, we will also consider the (de)normalizing effect of the creative process and insider status as an inhibitor and/or facilitator of that process. We will also explore our own privileged outsider status as critical writers. A heavy load of writing assignments will emphasize how to assume a critical (as opposed to a moral or purely aesthetic/affective) stance and how to make a logically coherent literary argument.Readings: Selections from Don Quixote, Graham Greene’s The Quiet American, J.

“Every time I bat my false eyelashes, it’s a political statement.”
–RupaulDrag queens are not known for their subtlety.  But tucked away underneath the bedazzled outfit and the painted face is a scathing critique of gender categories.  You think a girl should have curves?  Well, it’s just a question of a little padding.  Eyelashes that can wink seductively?  All it takes is a few tricks from a make-up bag.  Should a lady sparkle?  Then my dress will be covered from head to toe in sequins.  The drag queen deconstructs the concept of femininity, embellishing and eventually reproducing the elements that “organically” or “naturally” belong to women in general.  Through exaggeration, drag reminds us how every element of gender is in some way constructed.  It forces us to think about the way we attach meanings to the body.In this class, we’ll be looking at texts that hinge on a drag performance, understood here in a broad sense as a moment in which male or female cross-dressing becomes a vehicle for critique.  We’ll be exploring how drag calls attention to the “constructedness” of assumed categories, gender or otherwise.  Our sources will come from a variety of historical periods, and it will be our task to understand what is at stake in each drag performance.  What does it mean for a woman to perform as a man in a particular historical moment, and vice-versa?  How is drag linked to questions of desire, both queer and heterosexual?  In what way is every drag performance political?Furthermore, we’ll be looking at drag not only as an object of study, but also as a metaphor for our own reading practice—what we’ll call “close reading.”  If it is true, as Erasmus states, that “clothing is to the body as style is to thought,” we’ll use drag to interrogate what makes each text uniquely “form-fitting.”  As readers and writers, we’ll consider our cultural objects as performances in their own right, with drag providing a model for us to think about the complex relations between form and content.Texts will be chosen from the following:Euripides, The Bacchae
Ariosto, Orlando Furioso
Shakespeare, Twelfth Night
Catalina De Erauso, Lieutenant Nun
Rachilde, Monsieur Vénus
Balzac, Sarrasine

Gina ZupsichI. COURSE DESCRIPTION:Murder, sorcery, betrayal, suicide, adultery… These are a few of the charges brought against the female figures that we will study in this course. Opening up the term crime as broadly as possible, we will attempt to answer a range of questions about the relationship between women and crime. What is a woman’s crime? Are women particularly prone to crime? Is it a crime to be a woman?Looking at various narratives of criminal women, we will investigate the cultural, social and political conditions of women’s existence that inform their transgressive behavior. Our texts include novels, short stories, film, and gender theory that deal with delinquent women of diverse classes, races, cultures and occupations. We will examine how literature itself criminalizes and decriminalizes women, including retellings of infamous criminal women such as Tituba, a witch from Arthur Miller’s Crucible and Charlotte Bronte’s madwoman from Jane Eyre, who tell “their” side of the story.R1B is a continuation of college-level argumentative writing with an aim to develop more advanced writing skills based on literary critique and basic research. In the first week of class, you will write a 3-page essay that will help identify specific areas of writing for you to improve. You will write two 7-8-page essays on the course reading that  includes independent research outside of class. Our focus will be to practice the step-by-step process of writing from brainstorming to argumentation and revision. Class discussions are a vital part of this process as a way to focus critical themes and develop literary analytical skills.II.

S. Cochran(Please note that this course is only open to students who have satisfied the first half of the Reading and Composition requirement.)
Every day in Berkeley we pass individuals who are so eccentric, so strange, so “out there,” that we often call them (without reflection) “crazy.”  But how do we decide between “crazy” and “unique”—between  those who might be considered genuinely “mad” and those who are simply “marching to the beat of their own drum”?  In this course we will consider madness in its many forms and characterizations in literature, film, and visual art.  Our study, however, will not be of madness itself so much as the way it exemplifies the close connection, for all of us, between what we see and the imaginative lens through which we see it.We will meet Don Quixote who, pathetic or profound, sees a world that is precisely as romantic as he wishes it to be, and a Little Prince who knows for certain, when looking at a sketch of a wooden box with holes, that inside that box is a live sheep. We’ll listen to the townspeople, in “The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World,” as they re-imagine the village they thought they knew in the course of telling to each other the likely story of the dead body that washes up one day on their beach.  We will watch as the narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper” encounters successive new versions of herself in the paper that covers her room.As we examine the texts before us, we will consider how the process of reading fiction and of viewing art is also an exercise of the imagination: the worlds and characters we “see” before us are worlds and characters we ourselves, in part, create.  What does it mean to read?  What is the place and the process of interpretation?  And how do our interpretations of art impact the world we encounter and the self we create when we leave the classroom?  Is reading any less a process of intellectual creation than the one of writing: that exercise by which we give form and shape to our interpretations—represent and communicate to others what we see in the art we analyze?This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, interpretation, and research.WRITTEN TEXTS:FILMS AND VISUAL ART:We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

S. ScalaFlip through the cable channels and it’s easy to see that we, as a culture, are very interested in other people’s homes. From Hoarders, where we can gawk at other people’s misfortunes, to the home makeover reality shows on HGTV, you could spend a few hours a day peeping into others’ private spaces.What’s so interesting about these spaces? Is our pleasure purely voyeuristic? What can you learn about other people from their homes? To explore these questions, we’ll peek into characters’ houses and apartments, both in text and on film. The course will focus on urban interiors, allowing us to examine the relationship between intimate interiors and public city streets. We’ll be asking whether there is a specific literature of apartments and apartment buildings, and move towards articulating the relationship between interior and exterior in these works. Students will respond to these questions through active class discussion and guided writing assignments (culminating in a research paper).

J. LillieThis course includes a wide-ranging selection of texts and films that each involve deconstructing what it means—and reconstructing what it doesn’t mean—to be a human being. We will consider how experimenting with different ideas of alternative humanities, whether by human integration with the decidedly (or not so decidedly) nonhuman or by exposure to extreme circumstances, serves to highlight and/or question prevailing values. Such speculation and experimentation allows these texts to demonstrate their political and philosophical relevance, in addition to giving us the opportunity to analyze how fiction functions as an expository mode of writing. Likewise, a heavy load of writing assignments will emphasize how to assume a critical (as opposed to a moral or purely aesthetic/affective) stance and how make a logically coherent literary argument. Readings include fantastic, science fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction and film, in addition to several articles of literary criticism and relevant non-fiction essays that will act as models for your own analysis and research.Readings: Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, Selections from Milton’s Paradise Lost, Ursula K.

B. RubergThe girl-child, as we find her in literature, embodies far more than sugar, spice, and everything nice She is simultaneously the gateway of the imagination, inspiring (mostly male) authors to project themselves into her daydreams and create whole new, surreal worlds. She is likewise the object of erotic fascination: corruptible, enigmatic, ripe for the picking. At the same time, she becomes a powerful figure for (mostly female) authors seeking to reinstate her sexual agency; they show us a version of the girl-child who is herself desirous, playful but quick-witted, and self-aware.This course will use texts such as Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Nabokov’s Lolita, and Duras’ The Lover to examine, through literature, girlhood as a construct, a retelling, and a fantasy. We will close read graphic novels, video clips and visual art as well as short stories, novels, and plays. Creative activities will supplement analysis. Be aware that we will cover and discuss potentially sensitive material, such as sexuality. Since this course is an R1B, we will focus not only on reading but also on writing and research.

L. RamosIn this course we will make use of recent efforts to remap the Caribbean beyond linguistic and insular categories by exploring critical concepts and concerns Hispanic, Anglophone and Francophone authors share in common. Drawing from a wide range of disciplines (literature, history, and anthropology) and genres (fiction, drama and travel writing), we will examine how explorers, writers and scholars have continuously sought to redefine the Caribbean at critical moments in its recorded history. Beginning with the literature of discovery and exploration, we will examine how efforts to represent the region were historically linked to the desire for territorial control and imperial expansion. We will then turn to literary responses to the cultures of violence and subjection that the advent of European colonial rule brought about. Along similar lines, we will consider efforts by both critics and novelists to recover or rethink the histories of anti-slavery resistance in the Caribbean from the Haitian Revolution to the present. Finally, we will read works that seek to re-imagine the region’s parameters through their exploration of alternate location-based identities. Among the leading questions of the course: How has the geography of the Caribbean shifted over time? What do these shifts suggest about broader cultural and political transformations in the region? *Required texts:Sab, Gertrudis Gómez de AvellanedaThe Kingdom of this World, Alejo CarpentierGuerrillas, V.S.

L. Ramos & V. AlcazarWhat is world literature? In this reading and writing intensive course, we will examine works of literature not simply as products of their local environment, but rather, as windows into global cultural relations. In other words, we will uncover how writers imagine a world beyond their immediate circumstances by situating their work in an international context. Beginning with the concept’s origins in Goethe and Marx, we will read works that reveal an understanding of the world as a planetary order in concert and in conflict and as a geopolitical space of antagonisms and alliances. By closely examining texts that dramatize the relation between the local and the global in its manifold manifestations (center versus periphery, metropole versus colony, north versus south and private versus public), our aim will be to unsettle common assumptions about the nation as the primary locus of literary enunciation. However, rather than subscribe to a cosmopolitan view divorced from history or politics, we will strive precisely to reveal both the perils and the promise, both the pitfalls and possibilities inherent in the exchange between cultures across national boundaries.Texts:The Tempest, William ShakespeareThe Kingdom of this World, Alejo CarpentierHeart of Darkness, Joseph ConradSeason of Migration to the North, Tayeb SalihAutobiography of My Mother, Jamaica KincaidFilms:Happy Together, Wong Kar WaiBabel, Alejandro González Iñarritu

T. Wolff & J. HockCan one talk about a story without mentioning a hero? Must a hero always be the story’s center? If so, who (and what) is at the periphery — that is, what sets the hero apart from a crowd? What distinguishes traditional “foil” characters from the conventional hero (e.g. villains, outcasts, eccentrics, fools), and what happens when these characters gravitate toward the story’s center, i.e., begin to steal the show? How does the figure of the hero adapt and transform according to cultural desires and preoccupations? Perhaps we should agree that in the end, each hero is simply the product of a poet’s creative powers, as Maurice Blanchot suggests: “The hero is born when the singer comes forward in the great hall.” Then the question becomes: How does an author, or even the text itself, assume the hero’s vanity to become the centerpiece of a fiction?In this course, we’ll try to attack some of these big questions about heroic stereotypes across various literary forms and periods, by looking at, for example, a clever domestic servant, an existential anti-hero, and a bumbling detective. Our underlying motive throughout, however, will be to observe and describe the story’s counter-narratives. We will experiment with imagining the story and its hero as one perspective or argument, and investigate what alternative perspectives, or “arguments against,” the story proposes. A recurring theme will thus be issues of narrative centrality and eccentricity, of deviation and social hierarchy. There will be extra assignments along the way (including readings, written work, additional film viewings, and in-class presentations), but the emphasis is on literary and critical analysis — though we will also be analyzing things like news media, advertisements, and cartoons.

J. CreweWhile the literary world offers us countless child heroes, from David Copperfield to Alice in Wonderland, this class will focus on a darker theme: that of the child as an object of horror.  Despite associations with innocence, vulnerability, and imagination, the figure of the child has also become a metaphor for historical and cultural disaster, uncontrolled scientific progress, and the amorality of human nature.  From the monster of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to the brutal band of boys in William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, we will examine the place of the horrifying child as a vehicle for social and philosophical critique.  Why might one choose to represent historical or scientific crisis through the figure of the child antagonist? What particular threats does the child seem to offer to social structures both on and off the page? How do authors and filmmakers use representations of childhood to call into question our own moral judgment as readers and viewers? We will consider these questions (among many) through active class discussion and regular writing assignments. Please note: in this course, students will encounter representations of violence and emotionally disturbing material.

Allen Young“You taught me language, and my profit on’tIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you,For learning me your language.”Deprived of his land and his language, Caliban, in Shakespeare’s The Tempest, can denounce his enslavement only in the words of his master. The play is often read as an allegory of the conquest of the New World, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it has long served to frame discussions of cultural and intellectual relations across the Atlantic.  This course will trace the figures of Caliban and Ariel through a number of essayistic and imaginative texts, paying special attention to the claims they make about national or ethnic identity. We will then turn from Latin American reworkings of The Tempest to a broader selection of texts, from both Europe and the Americas, that address questions of cultural modernity in a colonial or postcolonial setting.Possible readings include:Michel de Montaigne, “On the Cannibals”William Shakespeare, The TempestAimé Césaire, A TempestJosé Enrique Rodó, selections from ArielFernando Retamar, CalibanOswald de Andrade, “Cannibal Manifesto”G.W.F.

K. Dodson“The mouth, tongue, and teeth find their primitive territoriality in food. In giving themselves over to the articulation of sounds, the mouth, tongue, and teeth deterritorialize. Thus, there is a certain disjunction between eating and speaking, and even more, despite all appearances, between eating and writing.” So write Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In this course, we will explore the disjunctions and connections between food, eating, speaking, and writing. How does eating extend beyond its bodily function to express and influence social relations, cultural and religious practices, aesthetic experience, and political and ethical considerations?Through examining texts in which food or the act of eating plays a central role, we will consider 1) the relationship between food, pleasure, and rituals of society; 2) literary and cultural appropriations of gastronomic metaphors, such as cannibalism, raw and cooked cultures, and analogies of consumption, digestion, and circulatory networks; 3) the political and ethical tensions embedded in what we choose to eat and how our food is produced.This course will also focus on developing students’ critical reading and analytical essay writing skills. Students should be prepared to participate actively in class discussion and group work. Assignments will range from shorter written analyses and creative responses to two argumentative essays based on careful textual analysis, one 6-page paper and one 10-page research paper.Readings:“Poor Man’s Pudding” and “Rich Man’s Crumbs,” Herman MelvilleThe Alice B.

P. HaackeIn this course we will study personal, imaginative and philosophical essays from a variety of periods, languages and countries, including early forms of essay writing, the establishment of the essay as a modern literary genre, and more hybrid forms of essayistic fiction, film and video.  Focusing on the productive tension between rhetorical persuasion and poetic style, we will consider the essay above all as a reflexive, mediating form of critique. Along the way we will explore the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity, induction and deduction, education and play, narrative and montage, and history and memory.Assignments will include: regular short analytical responses; occasional responses to other students’ work; one medium-length midterm essay about texts studied; and one longer essay or essayistic final project. Both the midterm and final will include a first draft, a revision, and a critical self-analysis of the writing and revision process.Texts will be chosen from among the following: BOOKSMichel De Montaigne, Selected EssaysJean-Jacques Rousseau, Reveries of a Solitary WalkerVirginia Woolf, A Room of One’s OwnRainer Maria Rilke, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids BriggeJean-Paul Sartre, NauseaAlbert Camus, The Myth of SisyphusJames Agee and Walker Evans, Let Us Now Praise Famous MenJames Baldwin, The Fire Next Time COURSE READERSeneca, “On Noise”Immanuel Kant, “What is Enlightenment?” and “On Perpetual Peace”Friedrich Schiller, “Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man”Sigmund Freud, “Creative Writers and Daydreaming”Adam Phillips, “Contingency for Beginners” and “On Risk and Solitude”Ralph Waldo Emerson, “Self-Reliance” and “On Experience”Henry David Thoreau, “Walking” and “Walden”George Orwell, “Politics and the English Language” and “Why I Write”Gore Vidal, “Perpetual War For Perpetual Peace”W.G.

A. YoungHow do the dead speak?  How does history make itself felt as a painful or disquieting presence? In this course we will examine how the past haunts “the modern” in a number of theoretical and literary texts.“Modernism” refers to a wide range of artistic trends that emerged out of the political, technological and social upheavals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In the wake of monumental change, many writers and artists found conventional modes of representation inadequate, abandoning them in pursuit of novelty and formal experimentation. But breaking with tradition did not necessarily mean turning one’s back on the past. Indeed, how to reckon with the past is a question posed, either implicitly or explicitly, in many modernist texts. We will read works by Vallejo, Woolf, Eliot and other nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors who explore the demands the dead—both literal and figurative—make on the living.Readings will include:César Vallejo, selected poemsRainer Maria Rilke, Duino ElegiesT.S. Eliot, The Waste LandVirginia Woolf, To the LighthouseHenrik Ibsen, GhostsWilliam Shakespeare, HamletJuan Rulfo, “No Dogs Bark”James Joyce, “The Dead”Arthur Schnitzler, “The Dead Do not Speak,” “The Second”Pablo Neruda, “From the Heights of Machu Picchu”Paul Celan, selected poemsAdditionally, we will read critical essays by Eliot, Woolf, Matei Calinescu, Raymond Williams, Octavio Paz and others.

Natalie CleaverRepression operated as a sentence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admission that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing to see, nothing to know.Foucault, We “Other Victorians”This course is centered around two works by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch and Donatien Alphonse François de Sade, the writers whose names gave us a word that can still seem shocking: sadomasochism.  As we read Venus in Furs and Justine, we will examine the literary representation of eroticized power structures and the rhetorical relationship between sexuality and violence, as well as the transgressive problematics of desire and identity that these texts foreground. But we will also investigate whether there is anything else to “see and know”, as Foucault says, beyond the literal level of these texts, paying particular attention to the nature of censorship, questions of artistic merit in the definition of obscenity, the relationship between the words liberty and libertine, and the politics of sexually explicit philosophical allegory. This course also expects serious engagement with a variety of critical texts from psychoanalytic, feminist, and queer theory.In addition to Venus in Furs and Justine, we will also consider the sonnets of Petrarch, Wyatt, and Shakespeare as an earlier iteration of these complex entanglements of erotic love, the written word, and bodily violence. Moving from the Renaissance to the proverbially repressed Victorian era, we will look at examples of violent erotica from Fanny Hill and two underground newspapers The Pearl and The Oyster, focusing on the effects of sexual repression on the representations  and rights of women, particularly with respect to legal issues such as obscenity and censorship and to the medicalized discourse of disease and illness. The course will conclude with more recent treatments of sadomasochism taken primarily from film, as we consider the ramifications of the categories of “normative” and “alternative” sexualities, contemporary attitudes toward the formation of sexual identities and communities, interpretative issues in studying the history of sexuality, and the continued impact of censorship and repression.NB: The texts for this class include nudity, violence, and sexually explicit material.

S. SchneiderWriting can be considered a heroic task in that the writer navigates a space and experience and serves as guides for the next to come, directing their attention at certain sights and sounds. In fact, writing shares much with space-building and architecture. Many of the texts and films we will read foreground their made-ness by incorporating multiple layers of media and perspective, as well as encouraging flexibility and plasticity in their readers.As this is a writing intensive course, many of our activities will be dedicated towards sharpening your awareness of environmental cues and their relationship to your reactions and feelings. You will then explore these correlations in your prose using precise examples from the text. Assignments include a diagnostic paper, a 6-7 page analytical paper and a 10-page research paper. The two larger papers will include a draft and the final paper, and we will place a major emphasis on the process of revision. Other assignments include approximately bi-weekly bSpace postings, group presentations, a final, independent presentation and in-class writing exercises. Course ObjectivesThis is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper. We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper.Books N.B.

L. Gurton-WachterWe tend to think of waiting in terms of time to “kill,” as an experience that is either frustrating, full of dread, or, at its best, just boring. This course will introduce students to methods of close reading, critical thinking, argumentative writing, and research through an exploration of a selection of texts that make the experience of waiting their main action or event, rather than what precedes the event, texts that suggest that something important  /happens/ while we wait for something else to happen, or that anticipation might allow experiences, perceptions, or thoughts that are otherwise unexpected, inaccessible, or at least overlooked.  With  this possibility in mind, we will examine how literary texts represent the varied experiences of waiting, dread, hope, restlessness, fear, patience, and impatience, while also investigating how texts ask their readers to wait — through digression, line breaks, and suspense, or through the postponement of information, of climax, or simply, of an ending. We will consider the temporality of the ordinary, asking how time changes during experiences of waiting or boredom, and how literary form might register that change. How do we experience time differently when we wait? How does literature heighten or highlight the experience of anticipation? Because waiting indicates a particular relation to time, we will pay particular attention to how literary form produces different temporalities. Of interest will also be unusual intersections of passivity and activity (and an investigation of how we define “action”), the distinction between waiting and boredom, and the structures of dread, procrastination, and hope. By focusing on anticipation, we will be mapping a variety of ways in which to imagine, understand, and /wait for /the future. In this sense, though the course topic may at first seem specific, the course will ask more generally how literary texts redefine and imagine our relation to the future.Course requirements include intensive reading, active class participation, quizzes, short critical and creative writing responses, several critical essays and revisions, and one final research essay.Readings will be chosen from among the following (please do not purchase texts until after the first day of class, as readings are subject to change):Samuel Beckett, /Waiting for Godot/Walter Benjamin, /Berlin Childhood around 1900/Raymond Carver, Selected StoriesHomer, /The Odyssey, /SelectionsHenry James, /The Beast in the Jungle/Ha Jin, /Waiting/Franz Kafka, /The Trial/Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail”W.G.

G. Bonetti & J. WeinerRomance proposes that we discover love through the act of reading about the experiences of its protagonists.  These stories help us to refine our ideas of love, both in its constructive and destructive capacities.  Tales centering on love define it by way of other central human emotions and cultural activities.  Stories of wandering and lust, wars and conflicts within society, sickness, death and loss are the avenues along which literature’s heroes travel to discover, lose, and often recover love.  In this course, we will begin by exploring the romance genre, which has established the rules and the models of amorous narratives, and thereby conditioned our expectations of the love story.  How does it employ the literary artifices of providence, coincidence, and repetition to structure our experience?  And how do the social forces of loss and social upheaval create the conditions and produce the circumstances for the elaboration of familial and romantic love?After introducing the romance paradigm, we will go on to explore other models emphasizing different aspects of the human psyche and our various cultural and social conflicts across the centuries.  Focusing on the opposition between constructive and destructive love, we will read stories centering on loss, lust and the compulsion to repeat, sickness and death, money, social upheaval, and class strife.  We will also encounter less comfortable passionate expressions of the human psyche, such as mourning, narcissism, sadism/masochism, and the death drive.  Readings come from the French, Italian, Spanish, German, Latin American, and Anglophone traditions, spanning the first through twentieth centuries.  We will supplement our reading of the literary texts with psychoanalytic theory, philosophy of literature, structuralist and post-structuralist theories.NOTE:  This class includes several long novels and should only be undertaken by those who have the time to spend reading.  Students are expected to read Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind before the first day of class.

Adam RzepkaThis course explores the history of escapes from history, focusing on constellations of texts that perform radical critiques of existing social worlds by imagining radical departures from them.  We will track the astonishingly diverse lineage of the utopian imagination, from ancient accounts of the Isles of the Blessed to the manifestos of contemporary anarchist enclaves.  We will examine the generic and political transformations that drive the darkening of that imagination as the specter of dystopia emerges from within utopia and begins to subsume it.  Along the way, we will also consider a number of ‘xtopic’ fictions that defy the utopia/dystopia binary—the nonsensical maps and languages of Lewis Carroll’s Alice books, for example.Our guiding questions throughout the course will be about the ways in which discourse is turned and stretched in experiments with space and time.  How, for instance, do sharply contested social and political topics in a specific historical period translate into topographies for societies that are intended to be timeless?  What impact does utopian removal have on the languages spoken by utopian subjects?  Why does resistance within totalitarian dystopias so often begin as a kind of remembering?  Where do we stand as historical readers when we engage with texts that envision a future society located in what is now our present?Major readings: Plato, The Republic; More, Utopia; Shakespeare, The Tempest; Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass; Kafka, The Castle; Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four; Gibson, Neuromancer. Shorter readings may include: Selections from Hesiod, Pindar, Virgil, and Horace; selected Renaissance travelers’ pamphlets; Defoe, “Of Captain Mission”; chapters from Thoreau, Walden; chapters from Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture; De Certeau, “Walking in the City”; Debord, “Theory of the Dérive”; Foucault, “Panopticism”; Jameson, “The Desire Called Utopia”; Hakim Bey, “The Temporary Autonomous Zone”; selected late-twentieth century manifestos. Films: Lang, MetropolisMarker, La jetéeComp Lit R1B:14Tu/Th 8-9:30223 WheelerCCN 17254H. Freed-ThallIn this course, we will investigate diverging accounts of aesthetic experience. Focusing on close reading, analytical writing, and research skills, we will attend to a number of difficult questions. Is there any difference between aesthetic perception and “ordinary” ways of looking at things? What is the relation between the production of art and other forms of labor? Does art have curative or therapeutic properties—can it rescue us from meaninglessness or mend a damaged life? And why does this question of art’s redemptive power become so pressing in modernity?We will read texts that invite very different sorts of attention, ranging from a medieval romance to romantic lyric poetry, from fantastic tales and realist narratives to modernist and postcolonial novels. Many of these works require us to consider the aesthetic potential of objects that fall outside of traditional aesthetic evaluation, whether because they are beneath notice, like a sock or kitchen table, or repugnant, like a maggot-infested stuffed parrot. In other texts, the aesthetic is allied with mute or passive modes of being, like Melville’s mysterious copy clerk, Bartleby—a character so uncharacterizable that we have to reorient ourselves in order to “read” him at all. In futurist and surrealist literature and cinema, on the other hand, art is granted the power to revolutionize the structures of everyday life.A course reader will include selections by Rousseau, Wordsworth, Poe, Baudelaire, Rilke, Melville, Flaubert, Proust, Kafka, Cortázar, Shklovsky, Benjamin, Blanchot, De Certeau, Bourdieu, and Beckett.Texts will be chosen from among the following (please do not purchase books until the first day of class):Chrétien, Yvain Shakespeare, The TempestFlaubert, Madame BovaryWoolf, To the LighthouseSebald, AusterlitzMichon, Small LivesBechdel, Fun Home Visual worksearly silent cinema by the Lumière brothers and MélièsVertov, Kino-EyeBuñuel and Dalí, Un chien andalouVon Donnersmarck, The Lives of Othersimpressionist, post-impressionist, cubist & futurist painting

How does the portrait of the devil change over time and across various cultural boundaries? If evil is that which a society strives to avoid, why does the devil appear so often in literature, and why does he make so charming a protagonist? Why and how are we encouraged to sympathize with him as an anti-hero?  In artistic terms, is Evil simply more interesting than Good?Beginning with Dante and Milton, we will consider the character of the devil in theological terms. What explanations do these texts offer for the existence of evil? Is it fundamentally a human quality, or is it divine/supernatural in nature? With these authors, as well as with Bulgakov and Rushdie, we will also examine the way in which the character of the devil reflects their concerns with the political conflicts of their time as a contemporary assessment of the nature of human evil: the turmoil of trecento Italy, Reformation England, Soviet Russia, and post-colonial India. What are the political consequences of representing the world as an eternal opposition between good and evil?We will conclude with readings from Barnes and Garcia Marquez which move beyond this dualism, and question whether there exists anything which can be characterized as good or evil, and whether a belief in absolute evil may not be dangerous in itself.  Throughout this course, we will also consider related examples from the visual arts, including the drawings and paintings of Gustave Doré, Hieronymus Bosch, and William Blake.

T. McEnaney In this class we will examine representations of leaving, entering, and working at ports, harbors, and docks, those especially dense waterfront sites of cultural, financial, and epidemiological encounter and exchange. Authors, filmmakers, and photographers have often taken the waterfront as their subject, and literary critics have recognized it as a privileged place in the history of storytelling.  As we travel through our course considering artists from Tangier to Cape Town to Athens to Havana to Oakland and beyond, we will pay particular attention to how artists represent the waterfront as a space to engage different forms of “otherworldliness” (cosmopolitanism, post-colonialism, supernaturalism) in chance encounters, temporal confusion, and conflicts between labor and leisure. We will also reflect on the place where our own reading occurs, and approach the Bay Area itself as a means to think through the unique problems and advantages posed by life on or near the waterfront.

J. Lillie Rather than focusing on a specific theme or genre, this course focuses on a wide range of writing styles, operating on the premise that you can’t write with style unless you know how to read it. Like many of the selected readings and films, the course’s goal is straightforward yet challenging: to consider how style and form convey substance and character in a text, and thereby learn to convey our own arguments stylishly. With that goal in mind, we will discuss works that all have highly self-conscious, unique, and lively written voices. Works for the reading and viewing lists were also selected for their provocativeness (to encourage valuable debate), for the extent to which they teach the reader how to read them and thus reward close reading, and for overall degree of fun and weirdness (always good indicators of a work that takes its style seriously). In addition to being written in unique (and sometimes notorious) styles, many incorporate style as a theme of the narrative itself, in which the freedoms and trappings of the written language play a crucial role. We’ll also play with our own styles through mimicry and invention (on paper) and by analyzing works through a variety of media (including in-class performances).Likely Readings:Films:Comp Lit R1B:15

P. Brito & J. VakninThis class is about texts that want to take in entire worlds. It’s about stories, novels, and poems that aspire to the comprehensiveness of encyclopedias. This ambition gives them a strange, hybrid quality: the way that they catalog and communicate vast quantities of information often makes them seem more like non-literary texts than what we traditionally think of as literature. They will allow us to think about the often-complicated relationship between fiction and non-fiction, to consider the many ways in which texts connect both to the “real world” and to one another, and to reflect on what it means to read literature at a time when seemingly everything worth knowing is instantly available on the Internet.First and foremost, however, this is a writing course. It will be focused on the process of writing–on the many choices, simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating an interpretation of a literary text to a reader.Readings will be drawn from the following:Stories by Jorge Luis BorgesThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot DíazThe Waste Land by T.S.

Luis RamosThis course takes as its object of reflection a question Gustavo Pérez Firmat nearly two decades ago posed:  Do the Americas share a common literature? That is, do the two Americas—north and south, continental and insular, polar and equatorial—share textual common ground? If so, what similar literary strategies and common critical concerns might such an ensemble of texts bring to the fore? This course takes up these questions from a historical—and materialist—perspective; that is, from one that views history (and by extension, literature) from the violent and traumatic conditions from which they both emerge. In so doing, however, we will not subscribe to a deterministic or defeatist view of either, but rather, to one wherein both emancipation and conquest, resistance and domination, dispossession and regeneration, are accounted for in equal measure. Students should expect not only to devise novel strategies of conceiving the relation between literary traditions typically understood as distinct, but moreover, to articulate previously unforeseen ways of thinking about the Americas as an expanded category of aesthetic and geopolitical thought. In keeping with the above aims, the course will be structured into four related units: The meaning of freedom and self-awareness in Anglo American and Spanish American republican thought (1); the imprint of slavery and diasporic identity in Afro Cuban and African American poetry (2); the legacies of conquest in Pueblo Indian and Mayan historical consciousness (3); and the histories of Chinese new world migration in Asian American and Cuban American fiction (4). Comp Lit 1B: 15

L. Gurton-WachterIs the experience of spectatorship active or passive, pleasurable or disturbing, a responsibility or a retreat from it? We tend to think of the acts of watching, looking, and observing as straightforward and stable experiences with relatively few problems. We rarely attend to our own roles as spectators when we watch films or television, and we typically trust our powers of observation to watch and evaluate the world around us without interference. In this course, we will investigate the positions from which we watch through a series of texts, films, performances, and images that question and destabilize our roles and responsibilities as spectators. Using Aristotle’s model of how audiences respond to and experience tragedy as our starting point, we will then read a series of texts that suggest that the act of looking – though it might seem both natural and neutral – is actually fraught with political and ethical consequences. We will think about the experience of watching and witnessing the suffering of others, about how we look at or observe those who are different from ourselves, and consider how photography, film, and theater transform what it means to watch altogether. Central to our discussions will be the pleasures and perils of watching, and the question of how distance and proximity alter the object of our observation. We will devote a significant portion of the class to thinking specifically about theater and the role of the audience, imagining theater as a site in which ethical debates about looking emerge, and asking whether theater and performance provokes, pacifies, shocks, or instructs its viewers.This reading and composition course will introduce students to methods of close reading, critical thinking, argumentative writing, and research. There will be weekly grammar and style assignments, and significant time spent on revision and improving students’ writing.Readings will include*:Aristotle, The Poetics

D. Simon & R. McGlazerIt’s commonplace to praise a novel by saying it “comes alive,” but much less commonplace to recognize such a statement as a miniature act of puppetry, which grants life to a handheld object as artificial as it is inanimate. All literary genres display elements of puppetry: reading a lyric poem, for instance, often means conjuring forth a counterfeit human face that speaks or sings. This course will explore works of literary art that reflect on the nature of reading and writing by drawing on the art of puppetry, conceived broadly to include a wide range of practices that extend (or replace) human (or animal) body parts. As we proceed, we’ll consider the complications that arise when humans take on the artificiality of puppets; and puppets, the vivacity of human beings. Although we’ll be interested in broad themes (the human and the inhuman, the organic and the inorganic), as well as distinct but related issues (robotics, prosthetics, remote control, and “puppet governments”), our goal will be to focus on the specifics of the puppeteer’s art: the throwing of voices (and faces, by delegating the responsibility for facial expression to the hand), the splitting of subjectivity (as in the ventriloquist’s repartee with his dummy), and the combination of jerkiness and fluidity in aesthetic imitations of life (as in the marionette theater). As the course title indicates, we’ll pay special attention to the puppet’s frequent status as an object of fear (tinged with desire). Texts/films will include some of the following, in addition to critical readings from De Man, Freud, Johnson, Nelson, Stewart-Steinberg, and Winnicott:Plato, The Republic (selections on the allegory of the cave [of shadow puppets])
Homer, The Odyssey (selections on Odysseus’s manipulation of sheep)

Ovid, Metamorphoses X (on Pygmalion)

T. Singleton & T. LuuIt is about putting life back in where only a vague memory or a bare trace was visible to those who bothered to look.[1] —Avery GordonTaking cues from Avery Gordon, this course will consider seriously the matter of ghosts in literary texts. Ghosts are not simply the incorporeal return of the dead associated with religious or spiritual practices and beliefs. Rather, they are public, social figures whose haunting can take us to “that dense site where history and subjectivity make social life.”[2] Their practice of haunting underscores contemporary concerns about narratives of exclusion and silencing, as well as the concern with what can actually be known and the ethical considerations that such investigations should demand. The course will ask the following: 1) What is the political status of ghosts in memory, commemoration, and the nostalgia of exile? 2) What can our study of ghosts reveal about the historical and linguistic structures that are the sources of their haunting? 3) What conceptual and ethical dilemmas must we confront in such an investigation? 4) How do we capture the ghostly-speak?

Alvin HenryHe that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.Sigmund Freud, Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria“Nothing exists outside us except a state of mind . . . a desire for solace, for relief, for something outside these miserable pigmies, these feeble, these ugly, these craven men and women.”Virginia Woolf, Mrs. DallowayIn this reading and research writing composition course, we will examine the questions of “how and why have literary artists transformed representations of consciousness across time and place” and “what critiques do these artists make by shifting the forms of their art?” We will begin our conversation in Renaissance England where everyone worried over who would succeed Queen Elizabeth—and if a bloody war would be required to instate the new monarch. William Shakespeare captures this social anxiety in his comedy Measure for Measure. Our task includes interpreting why Shakespeare would write about fear and confusion in a comedy rather than another form, say the seemingly more obvious choice of tragedy. Hopefully by digging into the dirty little secrets of the play, we can come up with some fun ideas. As our tools, we will explore these questions and the larger course questions by performing close readings: paying attention to grammar, parts of speech, word choice, and a host of literary devices. We will continue our readings by covering more literary genres include poetry, the novel, the short story, and an encounter with psychoanalysis.In addition to answering and challenging the course themes, we will foster your academic reading and writing skills. We will learn how to perform a critical analysis and close reading of a text along with mastering a variety of rhetorical strategies in order for you to craft a research essay. You will leave this course as a confident reader and a strong writer.

S. England & S SchneiderIraq’s history is often told as a series of endings. After the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 C.E., survivors reported that the Tigris River ran ‘red with blood and black with ink.’ Arab historians extolled the grandeur of Baghdad’s architecture, as well as the city’s royal and private libraries, largely destroyed during the siege. The Mongol invasion put an end to five centuries of the Abbasid empire, during which time Iraq had become the economic and intellectual capital of the Middle East.The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent looting of the Baghdad Museum and national archives, was another ending of sorts. Although Baghdad had long ago lost its lofty architectural distinction, its reserves of artifacts and manuscripts made up perhaps the world’s longest-running local archive of ancient, medieval, and modern civilization. What is—or was—that space, in particular from a literary standpoint? The object of this course is a critical and historical discussion of literature in Iraq. Our readings will include Iraqi Arabic poetry and prose (in English translation), literature about Iraq by visitors, as well as films. A key premise of this course is that the literature we will read is inseparable from its social and political environment. For that reason, much of the fiction and poetry we read will accompany historical texts and commentaries. Throughout the course, we will probe ideas of nationality, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism as they pertain to modern Iraq.

We will think through questions concerning the consequences of industrialization, gender relations, and the conditions needed to bring about a just society, among others. We will watch several contemporary films, and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on utopian fiction and sci-fi. We will consider some of the following questions: under what social conditions an “alternative world” becomes desirable? What do we mean by “world” and what might be its opposites? What role do literary form and genre have in constructing an alternative world? What kind of attitude do we adopt vis à vis such texts whose implicit or explicit aim is to be “more” than an imaginary experiment?Books RequiredThomas More, UtopiaIsaac Asimov, Prelude to FoundationCourse ReaderFilmsWachowski Brothers, Matrix IJean-Luc Godard, Alphaville  CL R1B:17

P. Brito & K. BudnerIt’s almost impossible to encounter a new cultural object or experience without unconsciously slipping it into some category or another. We take it to be a work of art or an occasion for entertainment, an expression of elite or popular taste, something real and refined or crass and commercial. In this class we’ll take a look at how these judgments of taste fit together and what’s at stake when we make them.Do these distinctions come about because of something special in the objects themselves or are they products of our cultural biases? By keeping these questions in mind as we look at a wide range of texts, both written and visual, we’ll be able to investigate why we consider certain kinds of texts worthy of being read and written about in a college setting.The central focus of this class will be to improve students’ capacity to articulate their interpretations of literary texts. The bulk of the papers will be on the assigned texts but there will also be opportunities for students to write about cultural objects of their choice. Texts will include: Novels:Don Quixote by Miguel de CervantesThe Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas PynchonAunt Julia and the Scriptwriter by Mario Vargas LlosaLucy by Jamaica Kincaid Plays:The Bacchae by EuripidesBlood Wedding by Federico García Lorca Movies:All About My Mother (written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar)Adaptation (directed by Spike Jonze, written by Charlie Kaufman) TV Shows:Twin Peaks (created by David Lynch)There will also be a course reader that will feature excerpts from Apuleius’ The Golden Ass; short fiction and poetry from William Wordsworth, Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, César Vallejo, and Jorge Luis Borges; and theoretical work from Plato, Aristotle, Friedrich Nietzsche, Dwight Macdonald, and Pierre Bourdieu.11Comp Lit R1B:17

S. ScalaHow do you say something that can’t be said? A wide range of authors has grappled with this paradoxical problem. Medieval mystics struggle to convey to their readers the inexpressibility of god. Hamlet can’t bring himself to accuse his uncle of murder. E. M. Forster writes about “the love that dare not speak its name.” In this course, we will examine how authors try to push beyond the limits of language. We will also ask: are these projects successful or futile? What kinds of things tend to be unsayable? Why?

M. LeeThis course begins by asking the question: is history what it used to be? We humans cannot help but remember or want to remember the past, and often device all manner of technologies and apparatuses to ensure the proper archivization of our limited time on earth. Historiography is one such apparatus. Its premise is that by following a concrete methodology about verifiable data it creates reliable knowledge about the past. In this course we will ask what is left out of this neat genre and system of remembrance. Or conversely, might there be things better left forgotten? What other modes of experiencing and constructing the past are available to us, and what do they bring to the table that history cannot or does not?Students will attempt to go beyond the “what” and “how” of the past, and reflect on the roles that the medium, mode, and archivist have on what we remember. In other words, we will think about how knowledge of the past, i.e. an archive, is created. To this end, students will study a variety of texts engaged with creating as well as remembering the past: as verifiable data, and as a means of doing justice to the breadth of human experience otherwise not captured by history. Throughout the course we will explore the relationship that memory and history have to the present and to the future, and how this relationship might be of significance.The course will build on the writing and reading skills introduced in R1A (or equivalent), and will work toward producing a final, researched paper after a series of shorter writing assignments and revisions.

M. CohenRod Serling said, “Science Fiction is the improbable made possible.” Works of science fiction construct possible worlds, possible futures, possible discoveries, and then explore the implications of those possibilities.  Darko Suvin says that the other essential ingredient of science fiction is estrangement; futuristic or alien environments are used to explore contemporary issues and themes which are all too human. In this course, we will read and watch works of science fiction that use alternate futures, worlds, and technologies to develop powerful social and political critiques of very real world problems. This course will teach critical reading and writing skills through a wide range and sampling of great works of what Isaac Asimov called “social science fiction.” Our materials will include works from the pre-history of science fiction (Thomas More’s Utopia and Robert Louis Stevenson’s Gulliver’s Travels), to the explosion of science fiction around the turn of the 20th century (Flatland, H.G. Wells, Metropolis), to contemporary works (Duncan Jones’ Moon), and many classics along the way in a range of media: Alan Moore’s V for Vendetta, Ridley Scott’s Bladerunner, Gene Roddenbery’s Star Trek and Ray Bradbury are all likely to make an appearance. We will also read and discuss recent critical approaches to and theory of science fiction to develop our own critical writing and research skills.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

J. DeAngelis & B. RubergIn this class, we will consider texts that present ‘re-visions’ of earlier texts through adaptation and intertextuality.  What new critical perspectives emerge when all or part of a narrative is redistributed in a different context?  How do factors such as a change in genre, a change in historical or cultural context, or even a change in the gender of the author create a unique dialogue between earlier texts and later re-visions of them, and what critical purpose does this dialogue serve in each case?  For example, we will consider the relationship between Charles Perrault’s seventeenth-century fairy tales and Angela Carter’s postmodern feminist versions of them.  We will also consider Carter’s intertextual use of the violent pornography of the Marquis de Sade.  What do the genres of fairy tale and pornography have in common?  How do Carter’s re-visions develop interesting arguments about both?All of the main texts on the syllabus were written by female authors, and a majority of the pre-texts were written by male authors.  Questions concerning gender will therefore guide part of our inquiry into literary re-vision.  Women spent ages on the margins of the authorial literary landscape, though they were frequently the subjects of men’s stories.  In some traditions, the female body itself has been associated with rhetorical artifice, both frequently considered in need of regulation and control by men, as the male-authored texts on this syllabus will demonstrate.  How have female authors re-treated women through literary revision?  Specifically how have they re-treated the female body?  In what ways might revising texts written by males be seen as an assertion of women’s intellectual authority? (‘Author’ comes from the Latin auctor, a person who was once considered to possess auctoritas, or ‘authority.’)  What limits on such an assertion are posed by speaking from within the confines of previously written texts?With respect to the medieval and early modern texts on the syllabus, we will also consider how issues pertaining to textual criticism relate to the main questions guiding this class.  How is our modern conception of a ‘text’ altered by considering the fact that numerous medieval manuscripts and early modern printed editions offer different versions of the same story?  How did the simultaneous circulation of multiple versions of the same story inform medieval and early modern reading practices, and how do modern editors grapple with the ‘problem’ of multiple versions?  We will consider how these questions, seemingly unique to medieval and early modern textual matters, actually provide a basis upon which to formulate interesting questions about modern adaptation and intertextuality.We will explore the topics above through active class discussion, critical research, and intensive writing and essay revision.Main texts, with pre-texts in parentheses, include:Comp Lit R1B:2

G. Bonetti& D. Thow“Every time I bat my eyelashes it’s a political statement.”–RupaulDrag queens are not known for their subtlety.  But tucked away underneath the bedazzled outfit and the painted face is a scathing critique of gender categories.  You think a girl should have curves?  Well, it’s just a question of a little padding.  Eyelashes that can wink seductively?  All it takes is a few tricks from a make-up bag.  Should a lady sparkle?  Then my dress will be covered from head to toe in sequins.  The drag queen deconstructs the concept of femininity, embellishing and eventually reproducing the elements that “organically” or “naturally” belong to women in general.  Through exaggeration, drag reminds us how every element of gender is in some way constructed.  It forces us to think about the way we attach meanings to the body.In this class, we’ll be looking at texts that hinge on a drag performance, understood here in a broad sense as a moment in which male or female cross-dressing becomes a vehicle for critique.  We’ll be exploring how drag calls attention to the “constructedness” of assumed categories, gender or otherwise.  Our sources will come from a variety of historical periods, and it will be our task to understand what is at stake in each drag performance.  What does it mean for a woman to perform as a man in a particular historical moment, and vice-versa?  How is drag linked to questions of desire, both queer and heterosexual?  In what way is every drag performance political?Furthermore, we’ll be looking at drag not only as an object of study, but also as a metaphor for our own reading practice—what we’ll call “close reading.”  If it is true, as Erasmus states, that “clothing is to the body as style is to thought,” we’ll use drag to interrogate what makes each text uniquely “form-fitting.”  As readers and writers, we’ll consider our cultural objects as performances in their own right, with drag providing a model for us to think about the complex relations between form and content.Texts will be chosen from the following:Euripides, The BacchaeAriosto, Orlando FuriosoShakespeare, Twelfth NightCatalina De Erauso, Lieutenant NunRachilde, Monsieur VénusBalzac, SarrasineGeorge Moore, Albert NobbsDavid Henry Hwang, M.

 M. Gordon This is a course about people who fall short, plans that go bust, and stories that don’t turn out like you thought they would. Not that you’ll be spending the summer suffering through a series of tragic disappointments. For as we explore the making and unmaking of lofty ambitions, romantic aspirations, prophecies, and personal and collective ideals, we will also be questioning whether they’re all they’re cracked up to be, or even worth pursuing in the first place. Where do these enthralling, often crushing expectations come from? In what way do they shape our attitudes towards the past, the present, and the future? How are they framed within artistic works? With what preconceptions do we approach these works, and how might they respond to those preconceptions? Whether as characters, narratives, or readers, could going halfway, amiss, in the opposite direction, or nowhere at all towards fulfilling expectations—going somewhere completely unexpected—bring its own rewards?Please purchase the following texts in the editions specified:Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot (Grove; ISBN 978-0802130341)

This multidisciplinary course will address a variety of questions, such as: What is the best way to mark a loss and to commemorate history? What types of roles does language play in facilitating the preservation of memory and trying to overcome mortality?  Can fiction act as a memorial for a lost history? How do documentary and testimony attempt to unravel historical fables, and what do they reveal about the slippage between personal memory and official history? The texts, films, and photographs selected for this course address these questions in their descriptions of monuments and preoccupations with uncovering and preserving the past. Many involve the juxtaposition of verbal modes of expression with architecture and photography as monuments and “evidence” of history. In addition to discussion in class and in an online forum, the course will place equal emphasis on learning how to make an analytical argument, improving writing and research skills, and learning how to revise papers effectively. Readings: Natsume Soseki, “The Heredity of Taste,” Okuizumi Hikaru, The Stones Cry Out, Anne Carson, Economies of the Unlost (excerpts), Sir Thomas Browne, Hydriotaphia, W. G.

T. WolffPlease note this course is only open to students who have satisfied the first half of the Reading and Composition Requirement. This course experiments with different approaches to close reading through the diversions and subversions of comedy. We will get used to treating the forms of wordplay that provide most jokes with their punchlines as corresponding to aspects of literary style, from ambiguity to anticlimax, from clashing registers to the much-maligned pun. We will also look for ways that the same slipperiness of meaning plays a role in our own everyday speech habits, and in the media that saturate our social formation and participation. The course theme is intended primarily to attune the undergraduate reader and writer to fine stylistic distinctions in literary texts, but also secondarily to reveal, and to offer descriptive terms for, the ways language plays games in our lives at large. For this reason, we’ll read with an eye out for the ways language and comedy structure and reconfigure broader social themes, from gender and sexual politics, to childhood and family psychology, to the establishment of cultural and legal norms. As opposites to seriousness/reality, the relationships between comedy, dreams, theater, and pretense will guide our readings of concrete comic “correctives” (e.g., nonsense verse, surrealism, performance art, childhood play, and camp). The course balances texts from a range of genres and media (including film, television and advertising) with critical texts that suggest the unexpected force of play and the “comic attitude” in and out of literature. As always, students should be aware that an R/C course is especially writing-intensive, but in this course an additional willingness to pause over, discuss and play with linguistic details is a must.Readings• Aristophanes, Lysistrata• William Shakespeare, As You Like It• Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Ernest• Muriel Spark, Loitering With Intent• Harryette Mullen, Muse & DrudgeThere will also be a Course Reader consisting of 1) selected the poetry and prose of Emily Dickinson, Lewis Carroll, G.

CCN 17271The concept of mobility appears to be a question of how a body can move—a biological distinction that separates motile and sessile organisms—but, in fact, its potential extends far beyond the individual body.  We speak of social mobility and political mobilization, and use related terms like ‘friction’ and ‘momentum’ in those contexts; at the same time, there are works of art called ‘mobiles,’ some of which are firmly affixed to the floor.  In this course we will look at many formulations of mobility and the genres that surround it, including the travelogue and the animated image.  Our texts include photographs, plate tectonics, public transit, philosophy, poems, film, dances, diasporas, sculptures, software, short stories, floating memoirs, and unmoored experimental novels.These texts will allow us to think critically about mobility from many angles, and to write about its manifestations and implications.  In addition to the process of pre-writing/drafting/revising three formal essays, assignments will include in-class writing, contributions to online discussions, peer editing, and multimedia presentations.List of textsWritten Texts Rihla (The Journey)—Ibn Batttuta (excerpts)“On Truth and Lies in an Extramoral Sense”—Friederich Nietzsche“Tell Me a Riddle”—Tillie Olsen“What’s in Alaska?”—Raymond Carver“The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner”—Allan SillitoeSelected poems—Naomi Shibab Nye“Letter from a Birmingham Jail”—Martin Luther King Jr.Log of the S.S. the Mrs. Unguentine—Stanley CrawfordInvisible Cities—Italo CalvinoSt. Martin’s Handbook, 6th Ed.—Andrea Lunsford Visual ArtsSelected mobiles—Alexander CalderSelected sculptures—Robert RauschenbergSelected photographs—Edweard MuybridgeSelected photographs (from the “subway photographs”)—Walker EvansSelected photographs (from “Untitled Film Stills”)—Cindy ShermanSelected photographs—Sherrie LevinePerforming ArtsPerformance or Workshop TBD—AXIS DanceBallet Mori—Ken Goldberg/ Yuri Possokov/ Muriel MaffreSynchronous Objects for One Flat Thing, Reproduced—William Forsythe/ OSUFilmsChoreography for Camera—Maya Deren/ Talley BeattyBand of Outsiders—Jean-Luc GodardDays of Being Wild (film)—Wong Kar WaiWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Imitatio, the Latin word for “imitation,” was an important literary and rhetorical principle in ancient Rome. In his “Institutes of Oratory,” Quintillian explains the importance of imitatio: “a great portion of art consists in imitation, since, though to invent was first in order of time and holds the first place in merit, it is of advantage to copy what has been invented with success.” To learn to speak well, one had to train oneself by imitating more accomplished orators. In the Renaissance, imitatio was taken up as a pedagogical tool, and students and scholars painstakingly copied and mimicked ancient writings in order to become great stylists themselves. In this class, “imitation” will bring together three different strands of study. In the first place, an introduction to poetry, one of the most fertile grounds of imitation. Taking the classical period (primarily in Latin), the continental Renaissance, the Romantic period and the contemporary periods as our touchstones, we will trace the most important poetic forms – the sonnet, the epic, the ode, and free verse – through the poetic tradition, seeing how writers imitated each other. In order to understand historical practices of writerly imitation, but also to understand poetry from the inside out, we will write our own imitations of the poets we read for class. This writing practice will transition nicely with the second goal of the class, to acquaint students with the skills necessary for researching and writing academic papers. Thirdly, we will take a broad view of imitatio, looking at the ways imitation has been an important practice in religion (“imitatio christi,” for example), art (schools of painters, fakes), and contemporary culture (plagiarism, lip-syncing, Elvis impersonators). Readings will include selections from the following authors and works:Mary Oliver, Rules for the Dance, A Poetry Handbook, Gordon Braden, Petrarchism; Thomas à Kempis, Imitation of Christ; Aristotle, Poetics; Quintillian, Institutes of Oratory, and poems by Bishop, Celan, Collins, Dickinson, Donne, Emerson, Gongora, H.D., Hopkins, Horace, Jonson, Keats, Lucretius, MacLeish, Mallarmé, Millay, Milton, Moore, Petrarch, Pope, Pound, Quevedo, Rilke, Rimbaud, Sexton, Shakespeare, Shelley, Sidney, Spenser, Stevens, Tennyson, Valéry, Verlaine Virgil, Whitman, Wyatt, and Yeats.CL R1B:22

While the act of narration in general might fairly be called a kind of manipulation, this class will examine literary and filmic texts that explicitly play calculating and, more often than not, cruel games with their characters and/or readers. Whether these games are played out between characters, or between the text and reader, we will examine the dynamics of narrative manipulations ranging from plot arcs to conspiracy theories, storytelling to retelling, literary puzzles to thwarted expectations.These concerns pose a number of questions regarding the idea of plot and manipulation: How does plot as a literary device relate to the action of plotting? Consequently, how do characters that are plotters, schemers, and conspirators reflect upon the idea of authorship? How can those caught up in the plot – here we may think of characters explicitly framed as victims or investigators, or ourselves as readers – respond to these kinds of manipulation? What do works of fiction have to tell us about the differences (or similarities) between play and reality? Does one stay faithful to the other, or conversely, what can we learn from their distortions?Finally, this is the second class in the Reading and Composition series, and will specifically address the process of writing a research paper. We will build upon the analytical writing skills students have acquired through their experience in R1A, and gradually work towards producing a final research paper. Requirements for the course include a library workshop, in-class presentation, and annotated bibliography.Texts may be chosen from among the following:Shakespeare, Twelfth NightBalzac, Le Père GoriotFreud, “Dora”Perkins Gilman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”Amis, Time’s ArrowPerec, W, or The Memory of Childhood Stoppard, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are DeadWelles (dir), Citizen KaneSinger (dir), The Usual SuspectsGondry (dir), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindHaneke (dir), Funny Games (1999 and/or 2007)CL R1B:23

I. PopescuSome texts rebel against a literary tradition, some against a political regime, and some against society as a whole. In this course we will consider works of fiction, film, music and photography, focusing particularly on their connections to rebellion and revolution. We will explore texts that explicitly deal with revolution and texts which deal with it on a metaphoric level. Together we will witness how literature and art work not only to provide awareness, but also as active agents with the power to incite national and global change.Students will be expected to contribute weekly blog entries on b-space, participate in class discussion and write and rewrite academic papers. In addition to the reading we will spend time revising, learning how to frame analytical arguments and use research material, peer-editing, and developing critical reading skills.Texts will include:William Shakespeare, The TempestKen Kesey, One Flew over the Cuckoo’s NestZora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching GodChinua Achebe, Things Fall ApartThere will also be a course reader which will include selected short stories, poems and critical pieces by Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges, Jose Marti, Pablo Neruda, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Norman Manea, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, Allen Ginsberg, and others.CL R1B:25

According to the philosopher Gottfried Liebniz, we live in “the best of all possible worlds.”  Whether or not that’s true, it hasn’t prevented us from ceaselessly imagining – or even creating – alternate realities: shiny fantasy worlds where our most cherished dreams come true or, when we’re feeling less optimistic, nightmarish dystopias where they are mercilessly crushed.  What constitutes a possible world or parallel universe?  How and why is it constructed?  By what rules is it governed?  Who or what inhabits it?  Where is it located in time and space – in our own backyard or in a distant galaxy, amidst our personal memories or a thousand years into the future?  How does it bring the “real world” – whatever that might be – into relief?  These are some of the questions we’ll be asking as we survey the possibilities and parallels presented by poets, philosophers, filmmakers, novelists, and science fiction writers.As this is a writing intensive course, a significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing a total of three papers: a two-page diagnostic essay and two longer essays, both of which require substantial revisions.  The final paper will incorporate independent research.  In addition, there will be a number of shorter assignments designed to hone your skills as critical readers and writers.

CCN: 17509Given the violent and tragic history of the Caribbean it is hardly surprising that many of the region’s greatest writers have sought to challenge historical injustice, and its legacy into the present, through literature. Some of the questions we shall consider in this course include: How does literature function as counter-history? How does writing resist historical erasure and oblivion? How do certain literary texts attempt to recover or re-imagine lost or suppressed histories? How can writing, rewriting, and “writing back” challenge or revise partial representations and misrepresentations of Caribbean history and subjectivity? And finally how does a radical engagement with the past open up new aesthetic and political possibilities for the present and future? This is a reading and writing intensive course with a research component that fulfills the second half of the University Reading & Composition requirement.Texts: The Tempest (Shakespeare), Une Tempête (Césaire), I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem (Condé), The Kingdom of this World (Carpentier), Wide Sargasso Sea (Rhys).

M. CudahyDeath, by murder, illness or suicide is the end result in many of literature’s most compelling stories of romantic love. From the topos of the fallen woman that permeates the 19th century novel, to the performances of awesome vengeance in Hedda Gabler and Medea, women heroines often take the brunt of society’s censure of “inappropriate” passion. The protagonists (both male and female) are always marked by their difference, which is often based on their willingness to confront society. They are somehow smarter, more interesting, more confused, and more demanding than everyone else. These tales inspire agile reading practices that incorporate an understanding of authorial, cultural and historical pressures at work in the formation of the text.In this course, you will be expected to write in a number of ways: 1) a 5-6 page paper and a 7-8 page research paper, both of which will be extensively edited and re-written, 2) one-page response papers, and 3) in-class freewriting.

By tracing the literary tradition of representing the devil, we will examine various incarnations of the diabolic, from byronic hero, to cunning deceiver, to the embodiment of evil’s pervasive everyday power. Where does our conception of the devil originate? What contributes to the devil’s allure as a literary figure? What is at stake in representing the devil as a character? When does the devil cease to be literal and begin to be figural, and how do we understand this distinction? How does the idea of the devil manifest itself in a contemporary context?

H. Freed-Thall & G. PageIn this course, we will investigate diverging accounts of aesthetic experience. Focusing on close reading, analytical writing, and research skills, we will attend to a number of difficult questions. Is there any difference between aesthetic perception and “ordinary” ways of looking at things? What is the relation between the production of art and other forms of labor? Does art have curative or therapeutic properties—can it rescue us from meaninglessness or mend a damaged life? And why does this question of art’s redemptive power become so pressing in modernity?We will read texts that invite very different sorts of attention, ranging from a medieval romance to romantic lyric poetry, from fantastic tales and realist narratives to modernist and postcolonial novels. Many of these works require us to consider the aesthetic potential of objects that fall outside of traditional aesthetic evaluation, whether because they are beneath notice, like a sock or kitchen table, or repugnant, like a maggot-infested stuffed parrot. In other texts, the aesthetic is allied with mute or passive modes of being, like Melville’s mysterious copy clerk, Bartleby—a character so uncharacterizable that we have to reorient ourselves in order to “read” him at all. In futurist and surrealist literature and cinema, on the other hand, art is granted the power to revolutionize the structures of everyday life.A course reader will include selections by Rousseau, Wordsworth, Poe, Baudelaire, Rilke, Melville, Flaubert, Proust, Kafka, Cortázar, Shklovsky, Benjamin, Blanchot, De Certeau, Bourdieu, and Beckett.Texts will be chosen from among the following (please do not purchase books until the first day of class):Chrétien, Yvain Shakespeare, The TempestFlaubert, Madame BovaryWoolf, To the LighthouseSebald, AusterlitzMichon, Small LivesBechdel, Fun Home Visual worksearly silent cinema by the Lumière brothers and MélièsVertov, Kino-EyeBuñuel and Dalí, Un chien andalouVon Donnersmarck, The Lives of Othersimpressionist, post-impressionist, cubist & futurist paintingComp Lit R1B:3

How does this term help us to understand the relationship between language and the world, as well as the role that literature might play in our lives? Beginning with texts in antiquity and the medieval period, this course will examine in depth the concept of fiction itself, and in particular the relationship between fictionality and the novel form, with an emphasis on novels written in the 20th-century. Here we will also consider the relationship between narrative and the representation of time, the relationship between fiction and truth, while examining historical shifts in the way in which the reader approaches narrative art epistemologically.

B. ClancyIn everyday life, we seem to know an object when we see it, perhaps less when we hear it, but our senses don’t usually have a tendency to fool us, and far less often do they baffle us. In contrast, it happens quite often in literature that a clear and reliable relationship between sensation and perception does not exist. This course focuses on literary works after 1600 where the senses are not what they seem, where the interpretation of sensation through perception is radically different than what it might be in reality. Indeed literature might often be considered as a world where sensations become strange and perception somewhat astounding, or even terrifying. We will therefore look at how the relationship between the human senses and perception takes a radically different form in literature and the effect that this has on our understanding of these human faculties. What is the value of a literary world where the senses are not what they seem or where they seem to create altogether new objects? Here we might also consider themes like madness and magic, as well as philosophical terms like sense-data. In exploring these pressing literary issues, a large amount of analytical writing will be performed in this course. We will learn how to perform sophisticated close-readings of the assigned texts while examining the literary techniques that authors use in the exploration of the human senses. We will then learn how to interpret specific passages and form original arguments on the basis of our close-readings.Required texts:Aristotle, The PoeticsMiguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (this text will be read in selections)Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil Bertrand Russell, The Problems of PhilosophyJames Joyce, Ulysses (this text will be read in selections)Alain Robbe-Grillet, The Voyeur

SetterHow is it that what seem to be our most spontaneous, personal, and intimate experiences – love, desire, affection – tend to appear as banal, scripted ones? Or is this only a function of the way – highly formalized indeed – in which these private experiences are represented in communicable, repetitive, public words? What is the role of speech, linguistic gestures, address and call, narration and self-narration, in desire, and what is the relationship between desire and writing – the writing of desire and the desire to write? Is it possible to talk or write about desire without betraying it? Or in Raymond Carver’s words, “what do we talk about when we talk about love”?We’ll start the course by considering Roland Barthes’s suggestion that the basic structure of a lover’s discourse is “someone speaking within himself, amorously, confronting the other, the loved object, who does not speak.” Then, while reading novels, short stories, poems, and letters, and watching films, we’ll follow, examine, refine, and complicate this structure. Among the things which might help us challenge, or maybe reinforce, it are: the possible existence of a speaking beloved, the significant role of the narrator/voyeur within the erotic scene, pederasty as an alternative organization of desire, pedophilia as a potential form of love, the ascetic/sexual love of knowledge, and the realistic utopia of an erotic community. In addition to reading widely in these different forms of writing desire, we will also try to increase our own, or at least improve our writing skills and get to know our desires better.Texts will include:The Song of SongsBarthes, Lover’s DiscourseGoethe, The Sorrows of Young WertherDuras, Ravishing of Lol SteinPoems by Sappho, Frank O’Hara, Jack Spicer, Adrienne RichPoems/letters by Emily Dickinson Films:Capturing the Friedmans (Jarecki)Contempt (Godard)

Nina PickIn this course we will consider the relationship between literature and psychoanalysis. Privileging praxis as well as theory, we will lurk in the library, eavesdrop in the analyst’s office, and peer into the bedroom to examine the various positions, practices and repercussions of psychoanalytic thought. Our project will be to read psychoanalytic texts as literature and, conversely, to read literature through or against a psychoanalytic framework, focusing on texts that explicitly exhibit a psychoanalytic engagement or critique. We will survey some of Freud’s key theories—on love, dream interpretation, hysteria, etc.—, and simultaneously we will read Freud reading: what was he reading, and how? We will examine both the myths at the foundation of Freud’s writing and the continuing momentous aftershocks of his theories: the creation and dissemination of new cultural mythology; the waves of resistance, criticism, disavowal, and dismissal. What were the driving myths for Freud? And what are the myths that drive us?To explore these questions, we will follow the Oedipus myth from Sophocles’ classical play, Oedipus Rex, to the post-modern play (in the other sense of the word) of Deleuze and Guattari’s schizophrenic Anti-Oedipus, Nabokov’s other family romance, and the paranoiac quest of Pynchon’s Oedipa Maas. How does the Oedipus myth continue to resonate in contemporary considerations of self and relationship? We will linger in the places in Freud’s theories that strike us as undertheorized, dissatisfying or provocative, to examine the ways post-Freudian criticism builds upon or dismisses Freud, specifically in its conceptions of female and/or queer desire. And finally we will look at how other genres—the novel, poetry, drama and film—perform their own powerful theorization.Texts will include the following (please wait to buy until after the first day of class):Sophocles, The Oedipus CyclePeter Gay, The Freud ReaderWilliam Shakespeare, HamletJuan Rulfo, Pedro PáramoVladimir Nabokov, LolitaPeter Shaffer, EquusThomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49Course reader and/or class handouts will include:Excerpts from Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus, Franz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks, Teresa de Lauretis’ The Practice of Love, and selections from Carl Jung and Adrienne Rich.Comp Lit R1B:4

J. BulgerContemporary debates about social matters often appeal to nature to decide them. Parties debating a common issue will attempt a familiar gesture: each will claim that its position is natural and therefore true. Why would an appeal to nature decide a social issue and what relationship between society and nature does this appeal assume?This course will consider what literature can contribute to an understanding of nature and society and their relationship. While mining the literatures of disparate times and places, we will explore the implications of different modes of seeing the relationship between the natural and the human: as one of opposition, continuity, determinacy, etc. We will also consider the multiplicity of “natures” that have been generated in different cultural contexts, historical moments, and individual situations.As we consider nature from the various vantage points offered by our literary texts, you will be encouraged to think about the argumentative appropriation of nature in contemporary debates: gender, race, class, sexual orientation; development versus conservation; local versus global; old versus new; science versus religion; man versus animal; and individual versus collective.In addition to focusing on the ways in which nature and society appear within the texts, we will also examine the role of fiction in shaping our cultural values and public policies with regards to nature. Why would one choose the written word as an approach to the natural world in the first place? What can literature do that other ways of thinking about nature cannot? Most urgently, what kind of solutions or insights can literature offer to those of us trying to address problems and tensions in the world beyond the written page?Throughout the semester, we will ask how reading about fictional worlds can be a means of better understanding our lived world: how do the situations and characters we encounter in the texts invite us to reflect upon our own lives, experiences, and decisions? In addition to emphasizing critical reading skills, we will hone our written and oral communication skills by striving to express our ideas and observations with ever-increasing clarity and ever-sounder argument.Authors may include Wordsworth, Yeats, Eliot, Faulkner, Baudelaire, Carson, Aristophanes, Carpentier, Wells, and Plato.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

G. ZupsichIn this course we will investigate absurdist humor as a mode of social critique and means of philosophical teaching. Our discussions will touch on a broad range of theories of the absurd from Kierkegaard and Camus philosophical inquiries into social ethics and the human experience to Vian, Artaud and Beckett’s aesthetic responses to certain existential and social problems posed by philosophical Absurdism. Questions we might consider include What is absurdity and why does it make us laugh? Are there some subjects that should not be mocked? Why or why not? Should absurdity be a laughing matter?We will examine various comedic treatments of absurdist themes in French, Spanish, British and American texts from Renaissance and neoclassical antecedents to the absurd to 20th-century American comedic film. Some of these texts explore the absurdity of marriage and family life, nobility, medicine and education, while others recount the adventures of absurdist heroes or comment on absurdity and the search for meaning in everyday life. Independent student research will be centered on theories of humor in film and literature. Students will write 3 papers, the first of which will be 3 pages and the following 7-8 pages each with outside critical support.

S. CochranIn this course we will explore literature of transformation: texts in which characters, or entire communities, undergo some change of form or change of mind.  Something in these characters, plots, or even narrative structures gets rearranged or reconfigured.  We’ll think, too, about how literature can sometimes ask us to become different as readers, in order to interact with a text at all.  Exploring the topic of metamorphoses, even revolutions (internal ones and external sociopolitical ones too) can help us reconsider our assumptions about reading and interpretation, including how we interpret the world around us.  As we try changing the way we read—exploring different ways of approaching fictional works—we’ll discuss how we might look differently at the most basic structures and value systems in place in our own minds and in the political and human relations that surround us.Considering how our own ideas can transform, we’ll focus especially on the processes of brainstorming and revision in our writing: how changing the language of our thoughts can change the thoughts themselves.  This will be a course in which we encounter great texts, reflect together on what we take from them, and express our individual interpretations in several longer, and shorter, papers designed to develop the best of skills in reading, writing, and research.Franz Kafka, “The Metamorphosis”Ovid, Metamorphoses (selections)Charlotte Perkins Gillman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”Aeschylus, AgamemnonShirley Jackson “We have always lived in the Castle”Nella Larsen, PassingJane Campion, The Piano (film)David Lynch, Mulholland Drive (film)Selected poems of Gottfried Benn, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton T/Th 8-9:30

S. Scala Often when we think of urban fiction, we think of the relationship of the text to the outside, to the cityscape. In this course, we will move indoors and concentrate on the ways authors depict urban interiors and how these interior spaces interact with the outside cityscape. We will ask: What kinds of stories tend to take place in such interiors? Is there a specific literature of apartments? How can we articulate the relationship between interior and exterior in the urban text? Ultimately, we will consider what models of reading such a consideration of interior space affords us. In addition to our reading of texts that take place in cities, we will read Pride and Prejudice as an example of a text that takes place outside of the urban setting. The readings for this course will be either in the original French or in English translation.Austen: Pride and PrejudiceLa Fayette: La Princesse de ClèvesLaclos: Liaisons dangereusesBalzac: Le Cousin PonsRodoreda: The Time of the DovesDuras: La douleurIonesco: RhinocérosPerec: La Vie: mode d’emploiA reader with relevant theoretical and critical works including exerpts from Marcus’ Apartment Stories and Erich Auerbach’s “La Cour et la ville”Comp Lit R1B:5

Suzanne Scala and Jessie HockEncrusted with history and heedlessly modern, intimate mental landscapes and sites of anonymous dehumanization, cities have been a favorite topic of writers at least since Plato wrote his Republic. In this course, we will focus on the role of the city in literature and film. Can a city function as another character in a novel? Can it be a “psychical entity,” as Freud called Rome? Why have so many authors created imaginary cities? In film, what is the interplay between the city as the location of the action and the action itself?

P. Dimova & J. RaischThe magical power of transforming the self and the world has held a compelling sway over the literary imagination throughout the centuries.  In this course, we will look at the ways in which literature has reflected man’s fascination with magic as supernatural capacity to transfigure reality, as superstition, as verbal magic, as carnivalesque playfulness, and as Romantic imagination. We will read texts that take magic and divinities for granted, explain the world by means of metamorphosis and magic, read metamorphoses as historical allegories, and posit the human capacity for imagining as the ultimate magic. We will discuss novels, plays, poems, fairy tales, and essays across cultures and time that lend storytelling, love and death, art and history, words and ritual, dreams and nature the magic power of transformation. Finally, the literal or figurative metamorphoses that we will encounter in our readings will provoke us to inquire into notions such as identity, corporeality, power, censorship, and resistance.Since writing will be the main focus and concern of this course, we will address how our conceptions of magical narrative can play a role in our own critical writing, and we will try to introduce magic into our own narratives. Students will be encouraged to explore and combine different possibilities in analytical, comparative, and personal responses to the texts. We will focus on the process of academic writing through research, paper revision, editing, and class workshops to reconsider and build up student arguments.Tentative Reading List:Films:Course Reader: Poems by Charles Baudelaire, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Konstantin Pavlov.

WagnerIn this course we’ll consider texts that reflect on and interrogate the act of storytelling in which they and their characters are engaged.  Each of the texts we’ll examine, whether a fairy tale or work of literary theory, Renaissance drama or Romantic poem, graphic novel or novel of ideas, is interested in the act of communication between storyteller and listener, or writer and reader, that characterizes the sharing of a story.  We’ll think about what forms these stories take when they come to us on the page or the stage and consider what’s at stake in the choice to tell a story in a particular way.  We’ll look at the relationship between stories and physical space, narrative and the self, and speech and the written word; we’ll question the ethics and politics of telling or receiving a story; we’ll interrogate the relationship between stories, memory, history, and trauma; and we’ll consider what happens to stories when language reaches its limits and communication break down.  Most importantly, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading, basic research, and analytical writing skills, learning to become careful readers of stories of all types and to better shape the critical stories that we tell in writing our own interpretations of literary texts. Required texts: The Tempest, William ShakespeareEmbassytown, China MiévilleTexaco, Patrick ChamoiseauMaus, Art Spiegelman“Max Ferber,” The Emigrants, W.G.

Jennifer Lillie & Lynn XuThis course includes a wide-ranging selection of texts and films that each involve deconstructing what it means—and reconstructing what it doesn’t mean—to be a human being. We will consider how experimenting with different ideas of alternative humanities, whether by human integration with the decidedly (or not so decidedly) nonhuman or by exposure to extreme circumstances, serves to highlight and/or question prevailing values. Such speculation and experimentation allows these texts to demonstrate their political and philosophical relevance, in addition to giving us the opportunity to analyze how fiction functions as an expository mode of writing. Likewise, a heavy load of writing assignments will emphasize how to assume a critical (as opposed to a moral or purely aesthetic/affective) stance and how make a logically coherent literary argument.

I. Popescu & C.  SchollWhat are human rights? How did this concept begin and where? How can literature engage with human rights as a discourse and a practice? In this course we will be reading/viewing texts that deal with the issue of human rights through a variety of genres and media: graphic novels, novels, plays, poems, songs, photographs, and films. We will begin to explore how aesthetics and the manipulation of genre work on us as readers of texts that often deal with traumatic historical events. How do literature, film, and photography manipulate a reader’s empathy? What role have these genres and media played in calling such sentiments into being and normalizing them? The texts we read will come from several geographical regions and historical periods, and one of our tasks will be to critically evaluate distinct, sometimes problematic articulations of human rights as we begin to formulate a more global definition and understanding of them. In addition to literary texts, then, we will also read theoretical essays by scholars from Plato to Lynn Hunt to help us understand how literature contributes to the human rights discussion and vice versa.Readings may include: Narrative of a Life of Fredrick Douglass, Anil’s Ghost by Michael Ondaatje, Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman, Maus (a Graphic Novel) by Art Spiegelman, short stories and/or poems by Julio Cortazar, Sherman Alexie, Americo Paderes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Maya Angelou, and Pablo Neruda, among others.

B. Clancy & A. TranA central aspect of the aesthetics of the novel involves the task of representing the passage of time. This course will start by looking at how literary temporality is addressed in antiquity in order to gain a better understanding of the role that the representation of time plays in establishing the sets of criteria that help to define literary genres. Another concern of the course will thus be to determine the way in which the novel’s various approaches to time, particularly in the twentieth-century, play a crucial factor in the aesthetic innovation of the genre. Here we will examine time in relation to things such plot-structure, characterization, style, and epistemology. We will then focus on distinct techniques used by twentieth-century authors to engage with this problem, seeing how such techniques produce unique images of temporality, as well as what the broader implications of such developments might be for narrative aesthetics in general.Texts:Aristotle, The PoeticsHomer, The OdysseySophocles, Oedipus the KingShakespeare, King LearVirginia Woolf, To the LighthouseMarcel Proust, Swann’s WayJames Joyce, UlyssesFranz Kafka, The Metamorphosis

T. Singleton & B. RubergThe ultimate villain in our stories is the monster; we project our conceptions of evil onto what we decide to call monsters. However, a monster is most often characterized in terms of physical description. Is a monster then, what we see and fear, what we know and hate, or what we don’t know and can’t bear? How then does evil function in our lives and society? This class will discuss classic and new literature and film to explore the social implications of the labels “monster” and “evil” to cover difference and unfamiliarity. We will explore literature that challenges traditional conceptions of archetypal monsters and the evil that drives them.

S. Schwartz & M. ZaydmanIn this class, we will explore the idea that texts are made up of moving parts—not just that books are composed of pages that turn, or that “film” means a series of still images running through a projector.  We will also consider the possibility that the whole inside of a text consists of elements that are constantly, and not always predictably, in motion.  In an actual mechanical object, moving parts—housed inside a stable structure—are supposed to go on clicking and whirring and spinning and interlocking; that’s how the device works.  However, mechanically speaking, they are also the components in a machine that tend to break down and wear out, to cause trouble, to disrupt the process.What happens when the mobile part of a story refuses to move the way it should, or when the images of a film won’t progress in the proper order? If a moving part fails, can another mechanical part substitute for it? Can some parts—characters, for example, or category nouns—be considered more or less interchangeable?  When the moving parts of a text confuse themselves with the stable structure that surrounds them, is it dangerous?Mechanical designers generally try to reduce the number of moving parts, because of these components’ tendency to end up in some kind of entropic or chaotic state.  Poets, filmmakers, choreographers, photographers, writers, sculptors, and painters, on the other hand, seem to love this state—and all of the possible kinds of moving parts that get them into it.  Working with this premise, we will explore a set of texts with hyper-mobile parts, mechanical problems, bent wire and thin string, strange substitutions, the tendency to go backwards in third gear, shifting frames, frozen screens, lost directions, bad reception, and something that keeps rattling when you turn it upside-down.  Students will have the opportunity to analyze these texts individually as well as collaboratively, and to create written papers and multi-media presentations that express their unique insights and ideas.  This class includes two formal papers and many short writing assignments, and places a strong emphasis on active, creative student participation.BooksIf On A Winter’s Night a Traveler—Italo CalvinoOthello—William ShakespeareThe Age of Wire and String—Ben MarcusFilmsVertigo—Alfred HitchcockModern Times—Charlie ChaplinThe Mirror (Zerkalo)—Andrei TarkovskyMeshes of the Afternoon—Maya DerenA Study in Choreography for Camera—Maya DerenLa Jetée—Chris MarkerVisual and Performing ArtSelected Untitled Film Stills (photographs)—Cindy ShermanSelected paintings—Gerhard RichterArtifact Suite (dance)—William ForsytheSynchronous Objects for One Flat Thing, reproduced(dance/architecture) —William ForsytheSelections in the course reader: Metamorphoses (Ovid), “The Nose” (Gogol), Hopscotch (Cortázar),The Gay Science (Nietzsche), Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (Freud), Capital (Marx), “Art as a Device” (Shklovsky)CL R1B:7

R. McGlazer and K. KadueAccording to at least one influential definition of aesthetic experience, art begins when appetite ends. By this account, artistic and gustatory, or figurative and literal, taste cannot coincide; hunger and even “healthy appetite” must be satisfied before any aesthetic pursuit can take place. In this course, we’ll study works of literature and art that refuse this definition by taking denial, rather than satisfaction, as their point of departure.  Far from setting hunger aside, the texts we’ll consider try to set it to work.  Sampling from the fasting practices of medieval women mystics and contemporary couture models’ starvation diets, we’ll cultivate our critical reading, writing, and basic research skills as we consider the relationship between writing and withholding as staged in a range of contexts and cultures.  (For our purposes, “writing” will be broadly defined, to include art-making and self-invention.)  In addition to looking at mystics and models, we’ll listen to Italian Renaissance lyricists “starved” for love and to severely undernourished English Romantics.  We’ll then travel forward to the 1970s to spend time with anorectic All-American teen idols and dessert-obsessed Brazilian typists.  We’ll take virtual day trips to nearby Pelican Bay and distant Belfast, with a week’s stay in Wonderland.  Along the way, we’ll ask how hunger comes to serve as both a figure for desire (so that lyric speakers are said to hunger for affection, and scholars to hunger for knowledge) and a name for need (so that famine marks the most abject poverty).  We’ll also ask questions like the following: What do artists and writers have to teach us about “unhealthy” appetites?  What role does temperance, the moderation or curbing of appetite, play in aesthetic experience?  What happens when works of literature and art call attention to their own slightness, or lack of substance?  When, where, and in what ways has hunger become a tool of protest as well as an aesthetic category? How can we bring the work of “hunger artists” and hunger strikers to bear in our understanding of contemporary food politics, or in politics more generally?Rather than answering these questions in abstract—and unsatisfying—ways, students will learn to read closely and to make clear and compelling arguments about literary texts.  Readings, screenings, and writing activities for the course will all encourage students to attend carefully to a wide range of aesthetic experiences, in order to develop tastes but also to work up healthy appetites for research.In addition to reading some of the texts and watching some of the films listed below, we’ll read historical and critical works by Brown, Bynum, Deleuze and Guattari, Ellman, Klein, and Vernon, and we’ll study performance art pieces by Abramović and Mendieta, among others.Literature:Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in WonderlandCatherine of Siena, selected lettersDickinson, selected poemsGoethe, Elective AffinitiesKafka, “A Hunger Artist” and “The Hunger Strike”Lispector, The Hour of the StarMahasweta, selected storiesMilton, Paradise Regain’dPetrarch, selected poemsRabelais, Gargantua and PantagruelShelley, Alastor; or, The Spirit of SolitudeVallejo, selected poemsFilm:Buñuel, The Land without Bread (1933)Haynes, Superstar (1987)McQueen, Hunger (2008)Pasolini, La ricotta (1962)Comp Lit R1B:7

P. Dimova & K. Dickinson Considered a non-representational art medium, music poses a challenge for artistic representation: how can music be expressed in literature or explained by philosophy? How can music depict or narrate, and how can we make sense of music if it does not convey precise images or does not tell articulate stories? And, finally, how can literature render the subtle nuanced affects that music delineates? Music has captured the literary imagination over the centuries, and writers, poets, and philosophers have tried to recreate its essence in words. Enchanting, transfiguring, transcending death, destructive, dangerously contagious, moving to tears, or unveiling the deepest recesses of the soul, music has reigned supreme among the arts with its unconquerable, uncontrollable power. In this course, we will read lyric poetry, novels, and philosophical texts informed by music thematically and structurally. Furthermore, we will listen to Romantic songs and operas and examine literature and music, as they attempt to capture and evoke the expressive modes of the other art. We will discuss literary music in its capacity to affect, infect, or transform the characters or the poetic subjects; to transport them to the world beyond, from life to death, and form death to life; and to create a psychological space where emotions, desires, and affects proliferate in their non-verbal precarious or sensuous ambiguity.While writing, presenting, and actively participating in discussions on various aspects of the literary-musical interface, students will improve their analytical reading skills, conceptual and critical thinking, and expository writing and style. Students will be required to submit a diagnostic essay and several essays of progressive length. Two of the essays will be extensively revised; the final paper will have a substantial research component.Tentative Reading List:Mann, Thomas, Doctor FaustusPushkin, Alexander, Eugene OneginRilke, Rainer Maria, Sonnets to OrpheusShakespeare, William, Midsummer Night’s DreamTolstoy, Leo, The Kreutzer SonataWilde, Oscar, SaloméCourse Reader: selections from Homer’s Odyssey and Ovid’s Metamorphosis; philosophical texts by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Adorno; lyric poetry by Celan, Goethe, Keats, Mandelshtam, Pushkin, and Rilke; shorter prose works by E.T.A.

Amanda Goldstein and Margarita Zaydman Though they seemed to lay bare the workings of so much of the natural universe, Newton’s  Principia famously declined to posit a cause, physical or metaphysical, for the gravitational attraction at work between bodies separated in space.  Over the following century, meanwhile, the distance between literature and science grew to define increasingly separate means of observing and representing the world. This course seeks to hone your critical reading and writing skills through the examination of literary, philosophical, scientific, and category-defying texts (from early to very recent modernity) that take up physics’ problem of action-at-a-distance. How, in these works, do forces of sympathy, similarity, memory, writing, or desire assume the capacity to move without touching? Are there influences that operate across distances in time, as well in space? How do our texts depict the medium (physical or otherwise) through which a delayed, waylaid, or mislaid “action” might pass?The fictions, poems, essays and films we will be discussing here present situations where the difference between cause and effect, action and reaction, break down: they will provoke us to ask just what kind of an action “looking-on” might be; how ideas might work as contagiously as germs; how war and violence can happen by remote-control; and how different genres, such as elegies or odes, engage their absent and present objects. Meanwhile, our emphasis on critical reading and writing will entangle us in new problems of distance and proximity. And although the notion of “action”  will be called routinely into question, it is clear that our class will require your active participation and preparation on several fronts: attentive reading before class and thoughtful contributions to discussion when we meet; writing and revising several essays; presenting a midterm multimedia group project; and preparing short, written homework assignments to be shared on bSpace or in class.

J. CaballeroFor the Spanish-speaking population of America, in particular those populations intent on staying the rest of their lives, the classroom is a very loaded site for discussions of identity, assimilation, agency and citizenship.  Perhaps this is because many immigrants brought with them a Latin American ideology that puts education at the core of citizenship and the national project.  Or perhaps this conception of the high school as a factory for identities and a battleground to determine which identities can be recognized is as American as apple pie.  Regardless of the origins of these ideas, they’ve become a burning question in contemporary American politics, with state legislatures banning books and attacking tenured faculty to prevent the wrong histories or identities from being taught.  In this course, we’ll study various examples of the Latino Bildungsroman, looking at how innocuous fictions about getting zits and being late to gym class could become so hotly contested.Note: This course has an intensive formal writing component, a research component, and an average weekly reading load of approximately 100 pages.Book List–          Gloria Anzaldúa, Borderlands (2012 edition – 1879960850 )–          Patrick Chamoiseau, Schooldays (1997 – 0803263767)–          Junot Diaz: Oscar Wao (2007 – 1594483299)–          Richard Rodriguez: Hunger for Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez (1982 – 0553382519)–          Esmerelda Santiago, “When I Was Puerto Rican” (1993 – 0679756760 )–          William Shakespeare: The Tempest (No Fear edition – 1586638491)Possible Films and Excerpts–          Frontierland (Jesse Lerner/Ruben Ortiz, 1995)–          Quinceañera (Glazer/Westmoreland, 2005)–          Mur Murs (Agnes Varda, 1981, 85min, featuring the A.S.C.O. performance art troupe)Shorter pieces and elective readings likely to include:–          Rodolfo Acuña, “The Stairway to the Good Life,” from Anything But Mexican: Chicanos in Contemporary Los Angeles (1995) and excerpts from Occupied America: a history of Chicanos (2004 edition)–          Junot Diaz: excerpts from This is How You Lose Her (2012)–          Guillermo Gomez-Peña, excerpts from Warrior for Gringostroika (1993) and New World Border (1996)Comp Lit R1B:8

N. CleaverThough we now associate the apocalypse with alien attacks, mutant insects, nuclear meltdowns, viral plagues, or dramatic natural disasters, the word originally means to uncover, to lift a veil. This course explores the connection between violent apocalyptic visions and the practice of reading as uncovering meaning, as we lift the veil of the apocalypse itself.We will begin with The Apocalypse according to St. John (aka The Book of Revelations) and continue following the trajectory of Christian eschatology through the arrival of the Black Death in medieval Europe with selections from Boccaccio’s Decameron. As we move through different visions of the end of the world to the 20th century, we will also be reading Frank Kermode’s seminal work The Sense of an Ending, interrogating the relationship between reading fiction and imagining the End.The advent of cold war brought with it a period of end-of-the-world apocalyptic obsession that has remained with us ever since. The second half of this course will focus on film as we watch some of the great classics of apocalyptic cinema, including Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 and 1978), Dr. Strangelove (1964), Night of the Living Dead (1968), Omega Man (1971), Mad Max (1979), The Day After (1983) and Akira (1988). We will conclude by reading one of the all-time best-selling visions of the apocalypse: Stephen King’s The Stand.Required Texts: Peter Elbow, Writing with Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing ProcessFrank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of FictionStephen King, The Stand and On Writing Strunk and White, The Elements of StyleWilliam K. Zinsser, On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction*Other primary and secondary selections will be made available in a reader and on the course bSpace site. The films listed above are representative selections.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page. But we'll leave it to you to decide if this is where you are supposed to be. What drew you to this place? Is there something you can learn from it in your short time here? Look deep into your soul.

J. Bodik & S. CochranLiterature is often about conflict—about individuals, nations, and worldviews at odds with one another. Within texts, characters “plot” and scheme against one another, and texts themselves can become involved in the social and political contentions that continually unfold in the real world.  Conflict in literature, in turn, is at the heart of narrative intrigue.  And intrigue often has a great deal to do with how individuals cope with their differences: how they define themselves and strive to define others.  In this course we will explore how intrigue as a literary phenomenon is not just a force that drives plot forward but also a lens through which to study the construction and representation of identity.This is a writing-intensive course with an emphasis on the development of research skills.  In addition to frequent short homework and in-class writing assignments, students will be expected to write a midterm paper and a final research paper.Texts:Homer, The OdysseyShakespeare, OthelloThomas Wyatt, selected poemsPierre Choderlos de Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons Charlotte Perkins Gilman, “The Yellow Wallpaper”Franz Kafka, “A Hunger Artist”William Faulkner, “A Rose for Emily”Martin Luther King, “Letter from Birmingham Jail”Ishmael Reed, The Terrible TwosFilm:James Toback, Black and WhiteBeeban Kidron, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

Jeffrey Weiner & Gregory BonettiThis course examines a term, “conversion,” in its religious context, and also in the areas of sexuality, ideological discourse, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.  We begin by reading Socrates’ account of the potential for poets to influence fantasy and desires, so that we may assess the extent to which art can produce a “conversion.”  From Ovid’s tales of unwilling transformation in the Metamorphoses and Shakespeare’s treatment of the subject in The Tempest, we go on to the Biblical accounts of religious conversion.  Why and in what context does a person choose to convert from one set of beliefs and one state of being to another?  What kinds of transformations occur in the subject and in her social context?  How is individual conversion threatening to the social and cultural status quo?  We will be looking closely at the roles of desire, fantasy, absence, and presence in the conversion of literary characters through the works of St. Perpetua, Ignatius of Loyola, Molière, and Cervantes.  We will also consider how the dream of the cultural Other’s conversion plays into our own fantasies.While we will always keep in mind the text’s role in converting the reader, we will focus increasingly on this function in more explicitly ideological works.  We will read Orwell’s Animal Farm and Collodi’s allegorical conversion of Pinocchio, as well as the aestheticized, psychological conversion in The Picture of Dorian Gray.  Holleran’s novel about gay culture in the late 1970s opens the way for a group conversation about the insistent role of sex, music, and dance as sources of individual and communal conversion.  We will listen to and analyze some of the most important disco anthems in this context.  The course continues with an exploration of the function of the text in converting a resistant audience through the Belgian film about a cross-dressing child in a bourgeois family, Ma Vie en Rose.  Finally, we will theorize about the possibilities for extending the term conversion to “sero-conversion,” meaning to become HIV-positive.  The movie adaptation of Kushner’s Angels in America will give us an opportunity to play again with the ideas of desire, fantasy, and communal resistance in the context of the “forced conversion” of HIV-positive people.  As the film’s audience, we are invited to undergo a “conversion” in our thoughts about disease, blame, and communal responsibility.Whether they are explicitly religious, ideological, or aesthetic, we will imagine all discourses of conversion as playing with similar kinds of desires, fantasies, and issues of agency between text and reader in the attempt to transform the individual and society.Readings will include most of the following:Texts:D’Aurevilley, Barbey “A Woman’s Revenge” from Les DiaboliquesBible, selections form the Gospels and Book of ActsCervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, excerpts from Don Quixote and Exemplary NovelsCollodi, Carlo, excerpts from The Adventures of PinocchioHolleran, Andrew, chapters from Dancer from the DanceHuysmans, J.-K., À reboursLoyola, Ignatius, excerpts from Spiritual ExercisesMolière, Dom JuanOrwell, George, Animal FarmOvid, excerpts from The MetamorphosesPamphili, Eusebius, excerpts from Church History and Life of ConstantinePerpetua, The Passion of St. Perpetua, St. Felicitas, and their CompanionsPlato, excerpt from The RepublicShakespeare, The TempestWilde, Oscar, excerpts from The Picture of Dorian Gray Films:Angels in America (Nichols 2003)Ma Vie en Rose (Berliner 1997)Music:Selections from the disco era (1973-1981)Comp Lit R1B:8

M. Gordon & K. BudnerThis course will deal with scams, schemes, and conspiracies, from bloody revenges to amorous pursuits to government takeovers. We’ll look at these plots from a number of angles: What, if anything, motivates the masterminds behind them? By what means are they carried out? What are their moral, legal, or personal consequences? We will also consider some of the broader issues plotting raises: Does plotting reflect a fundamental desire to exercise free will? When does an innocent plan become a devious plot? Can a plot ever be deemed necessary or legitimate? And finally, we will explore our core definition of plot as scheme in relation to its other definitions—as land, as chart, and most importantly, as the main action of a text.As this is a writing intensive course, a significant portion of our time will be dedicated to refining your prose. You will be responsible for writing and revising a total of three papers: a two-page diagnostic essay and two longer essays. In addition, there will be a number of shorter assignments designed to hone your skills as critical readers, researchers, and writers.

L. WagnerIn this course we’ll consider texts that dramatize the act of storytelling.  Each of the texts we’ll examine, whether an ancient epic or postcolonial novel, Renaissance drama or Romantic poem, fairy tale or work of literary theory, is interested in the act of communication between storyteller and listener, or writer and reader, that characterizes the sharing of a story.  We’ll think about what forms these stories take when they come to us on the page or the stage and consider what’s at stake in the choice to tell a story in a particular way.  We’ll look at the relationship between stories and physical spaces, narrative and the self, and speech and the written word; we’ll question the ethics and politics of telling or receiving a story; we’ll interrogate the interplay between stories, memories, and history; and we’ll consider what happens to stories when communication breaks down.  Most importantly, we’ll devote ourselves to the development of critical reading, basic research, and analytical writing skills, learning to become careful readers of stories of all types and to better shape the critical stories that we tell in writing our own interpretations of literary texts. Course readings will be chosen from the following: Texaco, Patrick ChamoiseauInvisible Cities, Italo CalvinoThe Storyteller, Mario Vargas Llosa“Max Ferber,” W.G. SebaldThe Tempest, William ShakespeareA course reader will include “The Storyteller” by Walter Benjamin, “Eckbert the Fair” by Ludwig Tieck, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, excerpts from The Thousand and One Nights and Homer’s Odyssey, and varied resources on writing and research.Comp Lit R1B:8

M. CohenAnd, though the shadow of a sighMay tremble through the story,For ‘happy summer days’ gone by,And vanish’d summer glory—It shall not touch, with breath of bale,The pleasance of our fairy-tale.-Lewis CarrollWhere the Wild Things Are, The Giver, Alice in Wonderland à la Disney or Tim Burton—works of children’s literature are amidst the foundations of our identities. These works bear weighty responsibilities: they teach us the morals and values of our culture and serve as common cultural currency. We love the memory of those stories read to us by teachers and family, and we pass them on in turn to the children in our lives.So what happens when we return to the seminal texts of our childhoods and (re)read them as students of literature, with the abilities to analyze, interpret and compare? In this course we will read some of the canonical texts of contemporary Anglo-American children’s literature (not all of which were written in English, and not all of which are all that contemporary). We will look at the barbaric standards of children’s literature popular in earlier historical periods, read some of the earliest examples of what might be called children’s literature (or is seen that way today) in an attempt to form a historical understanding of the genre, and we will read works from other literary traditions. Finally, we will explore secondary literature—from psychoanalysis to recent debates on Harry Potter—to understand what cultures require of and how they judge the works read by their children.In our writing, we will return to familiar texts and explore how our perceptions of them have changed between elementary school and college, uncovering depths we did not detect as children.

Margarita Gordon (formerly: Zaydman)Stories usually spring from extraordinary circumstances, when the quiet hum of everyday life is disrupted by a climactic event.  Crisis, defined as a turning point, can take many forms, from the economic one currently plaguing our country to the psychological and physical crises we face in our personal lives.  In this class, we will explore by what means crises arise, what they look like, and how, if at all, they are managed.  These verbal, visual, and cinematic texts will lead us through the disasters of war, the vertiginous heights of romantic obsession, the shame of betraying one’s own ideals, and the challenges of self-understanding and self-formation.“Crisis” is also the root word for “critical.”  This class is designed to encourage critical thinking, an attention not just to what a text might be saying but to how it goes about saying it, what linguistic or visual devices it draws upon.  You will learn to read attentively, write analytically, and participate actively and creatively in class discussion.Readings will be chosen from the following:Joseph Conrad, Lord Jim

S. ChihayaContrary to popular belief, it takes a lot of energy to do nothing. This course will investigate the activity of inactivity – what do we really do when we’re supposedly not doing anything? From classic exemplars of idleness and indecision to contemporary depictions of procrastination and all-out ineptitude, we will examine the various anxieties, difficulties and pleasures that surround inactivity. How do characters “kill time” and why do they need to? How do writers and filmmakers depict this odd space of nothingness – and still hold our attention? What is it about the figures of the idler, procrastinator, and slacker that make them so appealing to us? How do we deal with characters that are actively indecisive, or alternately, decisively idle? Finally, why are we so fascinated with our own inability to act?Through a wide range of readings and viewings, we will seek to answer these questions and more. Please be prepared to reflect not only upon the texts we encounter, but also on your own experiences of idleness and indecision.Readings may include: Hamlet, William ShakespeareRosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Tom Stoppard“The Jelly Bean,” F.

Do they suffer from an idealism that outweighs that of their
male counterparts? When women become superheroes, what remains of their femininity? To what extent is superpower masculinized?  Deified? Do super-heroines break through the stereotypical virgin/whore dichotomy? How do superpowers affect traditional roles of motherhood and marriage?

J. NelsenDoes a text “speak”? How, and to whom, do the words on a page make their unique voices heard? In this course, we will attempt to pinpoint and define some of the different voices that come together to create a work of literature. Our investigation will begin with a few mythical and infernal depictions of haunting songs and sounds that tell their stories in seductive and disturbing ways. In our readings of lyric poetry, we’ll explore how we might characterize the speaking “I” and the different interlocutors he or she engages. From ventriloquism to radio to futuristic talking machines, we’ll also consider various distortions and disruptions of the spoken voice and how these get transposed onto the literary text. Beyond these specific questions, we will of course consider each text on its own terms, paying attention to how its multiple voices intertwine with other central, complex themes and motifs. Throughout the semester, students will hone their own critical and analytical voices with regular writing assignments, revision exercises and in-class presentations.Readings will include:Homer, selections from The Odyssey-Dante, selections from InfernoWoolf, Mrs. DallowayCésaire, Notebook of a Return to the Native LandSelected poems by Sappho, Petrarch, Gaspara Stampa, Robert Browning,Emily Dickinson, T.S.

S. EnglandIn this class we will study literature about Iraq, by Iraqis and writers from around the world. The Fertile Crescent, in that it recalls both an ancient civilization and a modern geopolitical quandry, will allow us as a class to ask how literary traditions begin, how they end, and to whom they speak.  The Gilgamesh story, one of the world’s earliest known written works, is called the first epic—but it is no less accurate to call it the first flood narrative, the first political thriller, or the first buddy picture. In this course we will read literature from the Fertile Crescent as a series of traditions, each one read through the traditions that follow it. Thus, Gilgamesh is Akkadian literature that becomes integral, over many centuries, to Arabic, English, and the idea of World Literature. Similarly, The Thousand and One Nights is an Iraqi reading of Indo-Chinese fiction, and modern Israel becomes one of the major literary markets for Iraqi writers. Amidst these overlapping genres and contested positions of voice and identity, we will see how we as readers take an active part in shaping literary history.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

Munia BhaumikThis class explores a central problematic in modern literature, the split between the public and private sphere. The main topic of this class will be to investigate the contact between romance narratives, the domestic sphere and the social contract. Through discussion, group work and essay writing, we will be probing the dynamics between narrative, literary forms, the figure of the heroine and representations of the private sphere. Emphasis will be placed on complicating representations of sexual difference in the textual context of each work.  The class will examine how representations of the private are central to generating fictions about both sexual and cultural difference.Through a range of literary works, we will learn to examine how genres (i.e. the ancient tragedy, Victorian novel, slave testimony, film, short story and postcolonial novel) reproduce or contest certain norms of national and worldly belonging. Simultaneously, we will reflect on the category of world literature by probing the narrative tactics by which the globe appears as both a literary-philosophical concept and historical matter. In particular, we will grapple with both the critical possibilities and limits of reading the private sphere across nations and cultures. We will also explore how the private sphere emerges as a space of degradation and civic struggle, giving special attention to representations of suffering, conditions of labor (production and reproduction), norms of desire, legacies of imperialism as well as the emerging matrix between gender and globalization.There will be an emphasis on world cinema in this class and we will have film screenings in addition to the scheduled class meetings.Required Texts Books(Women of Algiers in Their Apartment) [1980]

S. Chihaya and J. CreweWhile childhood and its attendant joys often provide the focus for works of literature and film, this course will turn to a darker image – that of the child in crisis. The texts we will examine place young protagonists in situations of intense strain and stress, with a particular focus on the child in the midst of war and national upheaval. The questions that surround these issues are many and varied: why do authors choose to focus on children and childhood in these works, especially those intended for adult audiences? What is it about the figure of the child that allows us, as adult readers and viewers, to view problematic historical moments with such clarity? How might the child protagonist serve as a focus for our own insecurities and fears – and alternately, as a possible source of hope or optimism? Over the course of the semester, we will explore these questions (and more) in depth through discussion and written analysis.Texts will include:Pan’s Labyrinth, dir.

Writing has proven itself a particularly contentious political activity in the history of Latin American literature. From the early debate about whether or not “paper talks” in Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca’s Comentarios Reales to the misquoted graffiti at the beginning of Sarmiento’s Facundo to Fidel Castro’s guidelines for writers in “Palabras a los intelectuales,” what one has written on or about (escrito sobre) has often been interpreted as criminal. In this course we will examine scenes where the act of writing appears to transgress the law, as well as novels and stories in the noir genre (“el policial negro”) that take crime as their subject matter. Towards the end of the semester we will turn to the case of copyright and the internet’s role in recent debates about writing and human rights in contemporary Cuba. As we move through the syllabus we might want to ask: What constitutes a “criminal” act of writing? What does crime allow writers to say about writing and the law? When and how does plagiarism become literature? What is the relationship between writing and property? How does writing’s legal and aesthetic status change as it moves away from paper and out into the street or onto the web?Prerequisite: AP Spanish in high school or score of 3 or better on AP Exam, Spanish 4 or 25, or native speaker with adequate skills for the class.  A brief oral examination of Spanish will be given the first day of class.* All readings, aside from critical essays, will be in Spanish.

Karina PalauFrom Columbus’ ‘discovery’ of the Americas to ongoing debates about immigration and labor, travel has played a significant role in Latin America’s story.  But what does it mean to travel? How does the experience of ‘taking a trip’ being ‘out of place,’ or encountering a ‘visitor’ have an impact on individuals, identities, and cultures?  How has Latin America been a site of travels in pursuit of personal roots and unchartered routes, but also a region touched by the unexpected ruptures that can emerge out of experiences of travel?In this course, we will take these questions as a point of departure for our own semester-long journey through a rich body of materials, visual and literary, all of which touch on the theme of travel in and from Latin America.  Beginning with Columbus’ Diario, we will consider how travel and cultural clashes were seminal to the way Latin America came to be constructed historically.  But we will also examine a number of materials that explore the possibility for travel to break open and re-negotiate these kinds of constructed histories and identities.In our wanderings from descriptions of homecomings to touristy vacations, from journeys of ‘discovery’ to ethnographic missions, we will try to unpack the tensions inherent in questions of identity, movement, and the dynamics of cultural encounter that have played such an important role in shaping how the Latin American milieu has been both lived and imagined. Possible Primary Readings and Viewings: (Works originally in Portuguese will be distributed in Spanish translation)Excerpts from El Diario of Christopher Columbus’ First Voyage to America  Peregrinaciones de una paria, Flora Tristán Las Alturas de Macchu Picchu, Pablo NerudaLos ríos profundos, José María Arguedas“A mulher mas menor do mundo”(“The Smallest Woman in the World”),Clarice Lispector“El Etnógrafo,” and/or “El Sur,” Jorge Luis BorgesSelected poems by Nicolás GuillenPhotographs from Carl Lumholtz’ Unknown MexicoExcerpts from The Motorcycle Diaries, Ernesto ‘Che’ GuevaraExcerpts from Os Sertões (Rebellion in the Backlands), Euclides da CunhaThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot DíazBabel, Directed by Alejandro González IñárrituPossible Theoretical Readings: Selections from James Clifford’s Writing Culture and Routes, Mary Pratt’s Imperial Eyes, and works by Richard Rosa, Roland Barthes, and Levi-StraussPlease Note: This is an intensive writing course that fulfills the second half of the University Reading & Composition (R&C) requirement, but it is also bilingual course.  Writing assignments will be in English, but we will read texts in the original and regularly conduct class discussions in Spanish.Students must have completed one of the following prerequisites: AP High School Spanish, score of 3 or higher on the AP Spanish exam, Spanish 4 or 25, or be a native Spanish speaker with adequate skills for the class.  A language exam will be given the first day of class.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	We are seldom conscious of how mediated our relationship to the world is as we make our way through it. This mediation occurs not just on the level of conceptual cognition, but also on the level of embodiment and sensual perception. In this course we will analyze the ways in which different genres of literature engage with and interrogate the status of the physical body and its senses. For example, what roles can the body play in contributing to the narrative form of a novel or short story? Or, what can poetry tell us about the significance and limits of sensual experience while making appeals to our senses as we read it?What is the relationship between bodily perceptions and conceptual thought, and how might our reading of literature be able to inform us about the role of “reading,” or interpretation, in our encounters with other bodies? How does literature engage with the particular experiences of racialized and sexed bodies? How can a text itself have a “body,” and how does the notion of a textual or political body relate to our understanding of visceral bodies? We will pursue answers to these and other questions as we read through a body of texts from a variety of different cultures and historical periods.This course is designed to help students develop critical thinking, writing, and oral expression skills that are applicable beyond the domain of literary studies. Students will learn how to develop interesting analytical arguments, incorporate research into their writing, and refine their ideas through the drafting and revision of two essays. Short assignments will also be required in order to help facilitate thinking about the course’s material. Since this is a discussion-based course, a strong emphasis will be placed on active student participation in class.Possible texts include:Plato, The SymposiumMadame de Lafayette, The Princess of ClèvesAimé Césaire, A TempestCervantes, Don Quixote (selections)George Sand, IndianaHeinrich Heine, Germany, A Winter’s TaleSelected poetry by Wordsworth, Baudelaire, and DickinsonWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

S. TollefsonPeople today don’t have enough poetry in their heads, and everyone should be able to recite one or two of their favorite poems. In addition to its purely personal benefits, knowing some poetry by heart has practical applications: in a tough job interview, you can impress the prospective boss by reciting just the right line, say, from Dylan Thomas: “do not go gentle into that good night/rage rage against the dying of the light.” Or at a party sometime, you’ll be able to show off with a bit of T.S. Eliot: “in the room the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.”In this class we will read a number of “classic” poems as well as a number of other (perhaps lesser, but still memorable) poems, and discuss them. The poems cut across centuries and types, and students will encouraged to find other poems for the group to read.Students will be required to memorize and recite between 50 and 75 lines of poetry throughout the semester. In addition, students will prepare a short anthology of their favorite poems, with an explanatory introduction for each poem.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	We tend to think about illness in biological and epidemiological terms; much of our knowledge about health is communicated through the language of medicine and science—we look to doctors, pharmacists, nutritionists, and a range of other experts when seeking advice on how to lead a healthy life. But can science fully convey what it means to be ill?In this class, we will pay close attention to the ways in which illness gets represented in culture. From Shakespeare’s Hamlet to Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway and Lorde’s The Cancer Journals, our readings will be guided by the following questions: How does illness affect one’s sense of self? How have conceptions of illness—and health—changed over time? What are the political dimensions of health?What relationships can we identify between illness and literary form? What role does figurative language play in accounts of illness? And how does health status intersect with other modalities of difference, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and class?As part of the University’s R&C sequence, this course is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical writing and reading skills. In addition to regular attendance and participation, requirements include a series of essays—drafts and revisions—and short response papers.
Requirements:
Regular attendance and active class participation: Students are permitted to miss three class sessions without penalty. Any additional absences will each result in a deduction in participation grade. Keep in mind that attendance is mandatory during the first two weeks of class; students who are absent during this period will be dropped from the course.Essays: Students will write a total of three papers throughout the semester: a two-page diagnostic essay, followed by two longer compositions (including drafts and revisions). The final essay will require students to incorporate at least one secondary source. In addition to these essays, students will do occasional free-writing exercises in class.In-class quizzes: Unannounced close-reading quizzes will ask students to identify, contextualize, and analyze a specific passage from an assigned text.Reading responses: Students are required to write one-page responses to any two texts of their choice. These responses must be posted to b-courses no later than 5 p.m. the day before the assigned text will be discussed.Student presentations: Students will work together in small groups and present to the class their own analyses of an aesthetic object (novel, film, song, poem, short story, etc.) that is not included in the syllabus. Presentations should be about twenty minutes in length and should demonstrate a command of  the material.Required Texts:William Shakespeare, Hamlet

																	In this course we will read novels drawn from the British, American and Chinese traditions that experiment intensively with the representation of other minds, asking how these novelists sustain uncertainty as to the comprehension of fictional minds. Topics include Austen’s work with what later would be called free indirect discourse, James’ presentation of the restricted consciousness of a child, Woolf’s use of stream of consciousness, the interest of the sixteenth-century novel Plum in the Golden Vase in the exploration of sentiments withheld, and the 18 th -century Chinese novelist Cao Xueqin’s experimentation with interior dialogue. Readers coming to pre-modern Chinese literature often assume to find a conception of character based in interiority and the narration of thought. This expectation arises not only from our reading of European literature from Austen to Woolf, but from the legacy of twentieth-century narratologists who have cast increasing sophistication in the representation of thought as the teleology of the trajectory of the novel. Pre-twentieth century Chinese fiction, however, does not move inexorably in the direction of a conception of character in which interiority is highlighted. We will pay particular attention to moments in pre-modern Chinese fiction that appear to correlate with narratological concepts such as free indirect discourse, and attempt to discern alternate derivations.Primary texts include Jane Austen, Persuasion; Henry James, What Maisie Knew; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; the anonymous seventeenth-century Chinese novel Plum in the Golden Vase (Jin Ping Mei); Cao Xueqin, Story of the Stone (Hong lou meng)； short stories by Li Yu, Feng Menglong and Ling Mengchu. Critics include Peter Brooks, Sharon Cameron, Dorrit Cohn, Ann Banfield, Alex Woloch, and traditional Chinese commentators. All Chinese texts will be available in English translation.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	How does a book, a text, a poem, an essay, a film show us its insights? How do we get them to show us what they know? Why is it that we get nothing from reading a book one year and get a whole world from reading the same book another year? Why it is that sometimes we find a work (of literature, of poetry, of film, of art) at exactly the right moment in our lives when we are most receptive to it? On the contrary, why do some works of art never speak to us, or arrive untimely, before or after we need them? Who do we trust to help us see what a work of art offers? How do we decide this? What is the value of reading, reading hard, into something? How do you do it? And once you’ve found something, how do you convince someone else you have?These are the questions that will have no choice but to come up in this course. In a sense, this course is about learning to read, but in a particular way—namely, learning to read on our own, and then learning to show others, through writing, what we have read. We will read works of art and philosophy, and we will read others thinking about works of art and philosophy, and then we will learn how to position our own thoughts among academics and artists (even humans) alike, through writing.Focusing on literature, philosophy, film, and criticism, this course will pose questions like the ones listed above as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. With these goals in mind, members of this course will illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, creative in-class exercises, and consistent in-class participation.Required texts:Desiderius Erasmus, In Praise of Folly

Paul Haacke and Kfir CohenIn this course we will study personal, critical and philosophical works from a variety of periods and countries, including early forms of essay writing, the establishment of the essay as a modern literary genre, and more experimental or hybrid forms of essayistic fiction, film and video. Focusing on the productive tension between rhetorical persuasion and poetic style, we will contrast the essay as a reflexive, mediating form to other kinds of non-fiction (e.g. academic article, review, editorial, reportage, documentary, testimonial, and autobiography). Along the way we will explore the relationship between form and content, induction and deduction, argumentation and speculation, vision and revision, nature and critique, space and place, solitude and play, and history and memory. In addition to required readings and screenings, additional texts may also be suggested by members of the class.Assignments will include: regular short analytical responses and other writing assignments; occasional responses to other students’ work; one medium-length midterm essay about texts studied; and one longer essay or essayistic final project. Both the midterm and final will include first draft and revision.Texts will likely be selected from among the following:BooksMichel De Montaigne, Selected EssaysJean-Jacques Rousseau, Reveries of the Solitary WalkerVirginia Woolf, A Room of One’s OwnRainer Maria Rilke, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids BriggeWalter Benjamin, Berlin Childhood Around 1900Mahmoud Darwish, Memory for ForgetfulnessAlbert Camus, The Myth of SisyphusJames Baldwin, The Fire Next TimeJames Agee and Walker Evans, Let Us Now Praise Famous MenRoland Barthes, Camera LucidaGuy Debord, The Society of the SpectacleSusan Sontag, Regarding the Pain of OthersJ.M.

J. BulgerThe term “Modernism” coarsely describes a cultural movement that began during the sunset of the nineteenth century and continued into the first half of the twentieth century. Modernists experimented with new ideas and forms in order to liberate their arts from tradition. Yet as artists strove headlong into the future, they did look in the rear-view mirror to the distant past – to antiquity. In particular, Greek and Roman ideas, forms and texts litter the modernist literary canon as modernist authors translate and transmute the works of classical antiquity in order to advance their artistic projects.This course will examine the modernists’ engagement of classical Greek and Roman works. Why does the modernist author use the ancient in a project to create the new? How does the author give a new voice to ancient ideas and forms? What is lost or gained in the shuttling of material between 2000 years? How can ancient material refer to a modern context? As a reader, what is our relationship with the modern text, if we know the ancient source?Our readings will focus on a series of paired texts – one classical and one modern. We will begin in the 19th century and see how authors are using classical texts so as to highlight the differences or similarities found in the modernists. In our journey between periods and texts, we will get to know figures such as Odysseus, Tiresias, Helen and Orpheus as both classical and modernist characters. As we engage with different texts and their respective heroes, we will focus on not only how the authors rethink “stories” or characters, but also how and why they rework genres, such as epic, lyric and drama. We will consider, furthermore, how modernist film and opera engage classical characters and stories.This examination of how modernists read and revise ancient texts and literary structures will inform a sustained dedication to making you a better reader and reviser. Bouncing between millennia on the hunt for ancient voices and modernist re-vocalizations, you will be developing your own voice through a number of in-class and take-home writing assignments. As a 1A/1B class, you will learn to read texts closely and analyze them critically. With respect to your writing skills, you will master the basics of sentence structure, paragraph development and essay composition. In the spirit of this course, you will write and revise, revise, revise your old work.PRINCIPAL TEXTS

																	This senior seminar will offer students an introductory overview of, as well as in-depth engagement with, the work in aesthetics, literary theory, and criticism developed by the Frankfurt School.  “The Frankfurt School” was the term eventually coined to identify a core group of intellectuals working in and around the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung), founded in 1923 and affiliated to this day (except for its exile during and in the immediate aftermath of the National Socialist/Nazi regime) with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt. The Institute’s founders sought to develop new methodologies, which they called “critical theory,” combining theoretical and empirical approaches to explore the unprecedented complexities, difficulties, and suffering engendered by modern, industrial-capitalist society and the often authoritarian political responses to it. In time, their work also took up the new global dispensations that followed World War II. With regard to Left responses to modernity, the Frankfurt School sought to develop alternatives to what they saw as the determinist rigidities of orthodox versions of Marxian theory, whether Social Democratic or Leninist. As members of the Frankfurt School themselves often acknowledged, many of the fundamental concepts underlying critique had already emerged in recognizably modern form in the work of eighteenth and nineteenth-century figures like Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and others. In addition, twentieth-century contributions to critical thinking by Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Georg Lukács, among others, would prove crucial for the Frankfurt School.The members of the Frankfurt School tended to think of critical theory as an effort to understand the social organization of economics, politics, culture and the arts–-and, indeed, of everyday life—-in order to establish the grounds from which existing social dispensations and their values could be grasped and questioned,and from which alternative social practices and formations could be projected. Critique, they thought, was thus central to the democratic processes by which we assess a given sociopolitical formation’s legitimacy, viability, and efficacy. Critique also animates contemporary democratic notions of dissent, freedom of expression, and political participation, in which various values and norms are challenged, reformulated, and justified publicly through reflective analysis and open debate. Critique likewise helps us analyze, articulate, and contest the ways in which cultural, artistic, and aesthetic activities and institutions relate to the economic and political spheres.There have to date been at least three–-and today, we are perhaps amid the flourishing of a fourth–-“generation” of Frankfurt-School philosophers, theorists, critics, and thinkers. While each generation has paid important attention to the role that aesthetic and imaginative activity play in critical thought, it is arguably the Frankfurt School’s “first generation” that developed the most sustained and influential arguments for the importance of art and culture to critical agency. While this seminar will briefly discuss the Frankfurt School’s later generations, it will emphasize the foundational work of the first generation.  We’ll read theory and criticism focused on the critical value of literature, the other arts, and culture by a number of those first-generation figures, including Max Horkeimer, Herbert Marcuse, and Leo Löwenthal. But throughout the semester, we’ll emphasize the work of two figures whose work on literature and the other arts has proved decisive in both critical-theory circles, and, more generally, within literary, art, aesthetic, and cultural criticism (as well as within the work of artists themselves): Theodor W. Adorno, and his close friend–-who was significantly associated with, though not formally a member of, the Frankfurt School–-Walter Benjamin.The seminar’s first few weeks will involve a double-track focus. While reading Martin Jay’s The Dialectical Imagination: : A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923-1950, we’ll simultaneously read and discuss selected texts by three eighteenth and nineteenth-century philosophers whose thought provided points of departure for Frankfurt critical theory: Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, and Karl Marx. While doing so, we’ll also begin to read a number of brief literary texts (or excerpts from them), primarily poetry, prose-fiction, and drama.  Through the rest of the seminar, we’ll then read selections of key Frankfurt works, focusing on Adorno and Benjamin while considering other Frankfurt authors as well.  We’ll also continue to read short texts and excerpts from the fiction, poetry, drama, and criticism–-and perhaps, time permitting, we’ll work with some music and cinema–-by a number of artists important in Frankfurt critical writing, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Proust, Kafka, Joyce, Brecht, Stevens, various Surrealists writers, Beckett, Celan, Schönberg, Webern, Boulez, Chaplin, Eisenstein, and others. We’ll also consider later writers, including Cha, Césaire, Paley, Lorca, and Vallejo.Among the key questions and issues we’ll see Frankfurt aesthetics, literary theory, criticism, and cultural analysis taking up in relation to the making and experiencing of art will be these:  Does art offer us a kind of knowledge, and, if so, what status does such knowledge–often termed “subjective”–have vis-à-vis “rational,” science-oriented, “objective” or “conceptual” knowledge? How might this matter of knowledge relate to different kinds of value, or different processes of valuation and judgment, in modernity (aesthetic, artistic, cultural, political, economic)?  How do the mechanical or technological emphases of modern economic and cultural production interact with aesthetic “subjectivity”?  How should we grasp the relations of mass or popular culture, with what were once called–-and sometimes still are referred to as–-the “fine” or “high” arts? Finally, what can all this tell us about whether art, aesthetics, and criticism are–-or should be–-ethically and sociopolitically “committed” or “engaged,” i.e., aiming to contribute to the consciousness and activism of classes and groups who’ve historically experienced oppression and exploitation? 
[Note: Texts of critical theory, philosophy, aesthetics, and/or criticism will be presented in English translation, though, with texts not initially written in English, we will frequently consider the German, French, Spanish, etc., originals.  The literary texts we read that were not originally composed in English will be read and discussed primarily in English translation, though we will almost always, when possible, also consult a facing-page (or at-hand-xeroxed) version of the text in its original language–most often German, French, or Spanish. Knowledge of other languages–especially German, French, and/or Spanish—-is not required.]iWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

We will focus on the short writings, including aphorisms, fragments, parables and short stories. How are philosophical and religious questions posed in and through the form of a literary work,? And what difference does that make? Conversely, what does Kafka’s writing imply about the importance of fiction to philosophical inquiry? At the same time that we will engage close readings of his texts we will consider some of the major commentaries on his work by Derrida, Blanchot, Benjamin, Arendt, Scholem, and Adorno.

																	It’s been said that poetry is what is untranslatable, yet one poem often translates another, and many of us only read one another’s languages in translation. As a catch-all concept for whatever “out there” can’t quite be captured in human terms, “Nature” can also be thought of as a language only ever encountered in translation. In this senior seminar we will explore the complex relationships between these three shape-shifting terms–“poetry,” “nature,” “translation”–as we read together poems and essays from various linguistic traditions, including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. Each of you will be responsible for a poet in the language in which you are working. All readings will be provided in English, with bilingual editions used wherever possible.As we track poetry’s investment in metamorphosis and movement between organic and inorganic states, and as we consider the relation between the emergent fields of ecopoetics and world literature, other questions will include:What happens when we conceive of “world literature,” not in terms of national linguistic traditions and political territories, but in terms of the elements traditionally understood to compose the material world (water, wood, metal, fire, & earth in the Chinese tradition; earth, water, air, and fire in the Greek tradition)?If in many traditions poetry is intimately bound up with the notation of seasonal change, circadian rhythms, and other temporal cycles, what becomes of poetry in a time of accelerating global climate change, accelerating species extinction and habitat-loss, and 24/7 round-the-clock modes of production and consumption?Book list:Carson/Sappho, If not, WinterWeinberger/Paz, Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang WeiHirshfield/Aratani, The Ink Dark Moon: Love Poems by Onono Komachi and Izumi ShikibuRobert Hass, The Essential Haiku (Bashō, Buson, Issa)Miller, Emily Dickinson’s Poems, As She Preserved ThemZurita/Gander, Pinholes in the Night: Essential Poems from Latin AmericaAlfred Corn, The Poem’s HeartbeatA reader including works by Ovid, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Goethe, Wordsworth, Keats, Clare, Baudelaire, Rilke, Celan, Stevens, Snyder, Niedecker, Darwish and GlissantWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this senior seminar, we will revisit an age-old problem in the study of fiction:  how do readers become involved in the lives of literary characters? In particular, we will ask how the representation of thought and feeling influence our conception of fictional character.  Primary texts include Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility; Henry James, What Maisie Knew; Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway; the anonymous Plum in the Golden Vase (Jin Ping Mei); and Cao Xueqin, Story of the Stone (Hong lou meng); critics include Peter Brooks, Sharon Cameron, Dorrit Cohn, Dorothy Hale, Alex Woloch, Blakey Vermeule, and traditional Chinese commentators.  All Chinese texts will be available in English translation.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

T. HamptonDiscussion Sections:In many ways Shakespeare is the literary inventor of modernity. His plays depict the psychological, political, economic, and social upheavals that mark the transition from the pre-modern world to a world that is recognizably our own. But he is also the most international of all writers. This course will explore Shakespeare’s extraordinary literary originality by studying his most influential plays in an international context. We will locate Shakespeare in the culture of his period by reading his plays in dialogue with masterworks from across Renaissance Europe. We will consider how he and his contemporaries engage with issues of international scope at a time (like our own) of extraordinary political, religious, and economic turmoil. We will read eight major plays by Shakespeare, as well as works by Machiavelli, Montaigne, Rabelais, Cervantes, Erasmus, and Petrarch. This course thus offers an introduction to early modern Europe, an exercise in reading literature in an international context, and an in-depth study of a major author.Reading List:

																	Every family has its secrets. In this class, we’ll look at fiction, film, and poetry that reveal what happens when a family’s metaphorical skeletons emerge from the closet. Does the revelation lead to crisis? Chaos? Resolution? With some of our stories, the reader alone learns a character’s secret, while the story’s other characters remain in the dark. What kind of “revelation” is this? How does the possession of this secret knowledge affect a reader’s attitude toward the character and the story’s events? How do these secrets alter or contradict our notions of family? How do the ideas of family and kinship change over time and across distance?With these and other questions in mind, we will analyze a selection of short stories by Franz Kafka, Doris Lessing, Flannery O’Connor, Alice Munro, Sherman Alexie, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman as well as the poetry of Sylvia Plath.Our fiction and drama texts may include works by Toni Morrison, Dorothy Allison, Charlotte Bronte, Jean Rhys, Jean Paul Sartre, Alison Bechdel, and Marcel Proust.Films we consider may include The Royal Tenenbaums, The Quiet Room, Capturing the Friedmans, Ida, and Psycho. In order to explore these works in depth and from a variety of angles, we will exercise and hone our analytical writing, critical thinking, and research skills throughout the semester.In this course we will explore sensitive topics that include sexual abuse and ethnic violence. Reading and thinking in depth about these issues can be emotionally taxing and triggering for some.

																	The literary and artistic avant-garde of the early twentieth century was the most radical expression of European modernism in literature and art. We will be focusing on the four most forceful and creative of the literary movements to have swept through Europe between the 1910’s and the 1930’s: Italian and Russian futurism, dada in Zurich and Paris, Soviet constructivism, and French surrealism. We will be reading (and sometimes performing!) avant-garde poetry, literary manifestoes, short performance texts, experimental fiction and memoirs. We will also be paying some attention to parallel developments in the visual arts and cinema.Topics for discussion include literature and revolutionary politics, tradition and modernity, theoretical metalanguage and its relationship to artistic practice, poetic experimentation, the relationship of sound to meaning, the limits of art, the cult of technology, literature and utopia, the rise of mass culture, and the relationship of writing to theories of the unconscious.Writers and artists include: Filippo Marinetti, Valentine de Saint-Point, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitsky, Sergei Eisenstein, Leon Trotsky, Tristan Tzara, Hugo Ball, Andre Breton, and Sigmund Freud.Texts to be purchased:
Futurist Manifestos, ed. Umbro Apollonio

																	How do writers, artists, and social scientists construct bodies as archaic, classical, and savage in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? How is the body a site on which questions of political and social power are negotiated in relation to the archaic and the primitive? How do bodies suffer and inflict violence within these constructions of power? How are bodies racialized and sexualized in relation to the classical and the savage?In this course we will study literary, theoretical, and critical texts, as well as visual culture including film and photography, that will help us grapple with these questions. We will discuss questions of aesthetic form, the politics of representation, how ancient materials influence contemporary norms of race, gender, and sexuality, and the political implications of the reception of the archaic past. Our materials will be drawn from different historical moments and cultural contexts, including Ancient Greece, Romanticism, Modernism, avant-garde movements (French, Russian, and anglophone), the Harlem Renaissance, Italian postwar cinema, and contemporary American and Greek poetry and cinema.

																	In this course, we will explore a variety of approaches to description, from Classical examples of ekphrasis (that is, vivid visual description), to modern renewals of the technique.  We will read descriptions of fictional artworks from antiquity (Homer’s Shield of Achilles, Ovid’s Pygmalion) alongside recent fictional re-imaginings of the art world (Siri Hustvedt, The Blazing World).  Charles Baudelaire’s Paris Spleen and Bruno Schulz’s The Street of Crocodiles will provide us with two very different takes on descriptive portraits of cities.  We will also consider literary representations of the sublime and the ineffable — at essence, descriptive failures — in which authors stress their own inability to recount something that really cannot be captured in words.  And yet, in one way or another, these purported “failures” generally manage to capture something quite rich and fascinating along the way.Texts may include:The Lais of Marie de FranceCharles Baudelaire, Paris SpleenBruno Schulz, The Street of CrocodilesSiri Hustvedt, The Blazing WorldFilms:Julian Schnabel, The Diving Bell and the ButterflyFederico Fellini, 8 1/2Our course reader may also contain selections from Homer’s Iliad, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Edmund Burke’s On the Sublime and Beautiful, and essays by theorists such as W.J.T.

																	If literature contains forms of language that seem not to fit in everyday speech, how is it that even literary works that minimize the representation of speech remain deeply interested in language as a social phenomenon? This course approaches the question by presenting students with a group of texts that allow them to explore the aspects of language that receive emphasis when literary works place readers at a distance from speech. The course proceeds from the tentative claim that as long as we dwell in the realm of literature, silence does not refer to the absence of language; it rather denotes a range of viewpoints onto language as a social behavior.Focusing on works of lyric, short prose, novels, silent film, and criticism, this course will explore these questions as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. With these goals in mind, members of this course will illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, periodic posts to a bcourses forum, and in-class discussion.Reading and viewing assignments will include works byCharles BaudelaireMichel HazanaviciusE.T.A.

																	Florence, Rome, Venice… You may be familiar with Italy’s most famous destinations, but have you ever wondered what it would be like to venture further south and off the traditional tourist track? What is there in Italy’s South other than Cosa Nostra and ridiculously good pizza? Why did Italian Southerners historically face social and economic discrimination, and how does this discrimination continue today? How did Southern Italian writers construct, invent, and perhaps even “sell” a concept of their own South to a non-Southern audience, and how does this compare with constructions and inventions of non-Southern writers? How do problems raised by the “Southern Question” in Italy echo problematic constructions of the Global South in other geographic and political contexts?This course will explore these and related questions using a diverse and transhistorical range of literary and critical texts. Through close readings, discussions, and writing assignments, we will problematize the construction of the Italian South and its cultural, political, and economic repercussions.In this writing-intensive course, you will use your critical reflections on the texts as starting points for developing two papers. You will develop your papers through a series of brainstorming assignments, drafts, in-class workshops, peer reviews, and revisions. In addition, you will also complete shorter weekly reading responses and assignments devoted to specific elements of essay writing.Literary texts may include:We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	This class aims to reconsider our assumptions about the family home. Contemporary popular culture celebrates the home as a refuge from the world, finding in its separation from public life and association with the nuclear family the promise of a nurturing, comfortable space where we can simply be ourselves. Yet literature and film are replete with another sort of home: isolated but never totally private, familiar but never completely safe.Over the course of the semester, we’ll explore a number of unconventional homes.  In our first unit, we’ll visit some houses that, while familial, are anything but warm: haunted by ghosts, suffocated by unhappy marriages, or paralyzed by the threat of their own destruction. Then we’ll turn to a set of non-domestic living spaces, including the boarding school, the convent, the prison, and the hotel. As we move from familial homes to institutional ones, we’ll rethink the oppositions that supposedly distinguish them: between private and public, between what seems natural and what’s obviously artificial, and between home and everything that isn’t.Since this is an R and C course, its major goals are to improve students’ skills in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, and to explore the relationships between the three skills. In addition to discussing the texts in class, students will write responses to them in a variety of forms, from literary analysis essays to creative projects.Texts may include:Home:Anton Chekhov, The Cherry OrchardSigmund Freud, “The Uncanny”Friedrich Engels, On the Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State (excerpt)James Joyce, “The Dead”Albert and David Maysles, Grey GardensToni Morrison, BelovedEdgar Allan Poe, “The Fall of the House of Usher”Virginia Woolf, To the LighthouseAway:Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish (excerpt)Kazuo Ishiguro, Never Let Me GoStanley Kubrick, The ShiningPaweł Pawlikowski, IdaYorgos Lanthimos, The LobsterArt Spiegelman, MausWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	From fairy tales to rom-coms, a story that ends in marriage – after many twists and turns, accidents and obstacles – is, by definition, a story with a happy ending.  In certain literary genres, marriage is so integral to narrative structure that “the marriage plot” is synonymous with plot itself.Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique fulfillment to those who find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations.-Justice Anthony Kennedy, Obergefell v. Hodges“You see, François, marriage is a beautiful mistake which two people make together. But with you, François … I think it would be a mistake.”–Trouble in Paradise (1932)From fairy tales to rom-coms, a story that ends in marriage – after many twists and turns, accidents and obstacles – is, by definition, a story with a happy ending.  In certain literary genres, marriage is so integral to narrative structure that “the marriage plot” is synonymous with plot itself.  For both the characters within these narratives and their readers and viewers, however, the constraints of this plot can feel less like formal characteristics than like the workings of a more nefarious kind of plot, the machinations of which ensnare rather than enchant. As much as marriage has been celebrated as a timeless institution, “essential to our most profound hopes” as humans, it is also a specifically historical institution, supported by specific ideological interests that don’t always align with individual desires. When failure to embrace the marriage plot means a failure to perform prescribed gender and class identities, the results can be socially repressive, aesthetically productive, or both.In this course, we will encounter stories that revolve around marriage and stories that simply run into it, stories that end (as far as we can tell) happily ever after and stories that devolve into drudgery, disappointment, or death. We will ask how the marriage plot and its variants function differently in Shakespearean drama, nineteenth-century novels, and twentieth-century films, how even the most “conventional” marriage plots rely on deception and deviation, and how fictional characters construct their own romantic expectations through their (often uncritical) consumption of literature.This is a writing-intensive and discussion-based course with a research component, and our goal is to improve close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing as mutually reinforcing skills.Students will be expected to complete regular short writing assignments as well as drafts and revisions of longer papers, and will be entering into conversation with secondary sources to help build richer arguments.Texts and films may include: Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Othello; Austen, Pride and Prejudice; Flaubert, Madame Bovary; Cukor, The Philadelphia Story; Lubitsch, Trouble in Paradise; Godard, Contempt; Maguire, Bridget Jones’ Diary.Additional short readings from authors like Berlant, Cavell, Engels, and Freud will be available in a course reader.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Where once there was one, English now bears two.  Gender and genre come from Latin root gen, signifying “birth” and “race,” “kind” and “sort.”  Romance languages, however, tend to retain a single term: genre, genere, género, gênero, the French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese tell us. What can we make of these words, whose very root seems to describe the birth of another kind?Gender and genre have been understood as practices of classifying persons and texts, respectively. But we know the story is not so simple; in fact, we know that even presenting it as simple has sociopolitical consequences. In what ways do gender and genre negotiate, construct, and transgress taxonomic boundaries? How are these boundaries justified or complicated by their exceptions? Indeed, gender and genre themselves are terms that constantly exceed the very rules that seem to define them. How have these terms traversed time and place, and how do these terms, which negotiate conceptual borders, travel across geopolitical ones?In this class, we’ll embark on an exploration of gender and genre, as we travel across borders and centuries, at once constructing and deconstructing taxonomic implications. We’ll tackle how poems and plays, novels, films, and advertisements both use and abuse, thematize and problematize generic and gendered language. And as we investigate the words we read, so too will we scrutinize the words we write. We’ll explore the many choices, both simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating interpretations of a text to a reader.As a Reading & Composition course, sustained critical engagement with the process of writing will guide our intellectual exploration of gender and genre. A series of writing activities will help us conceptualize how writing is fundamentally social: a tool with agency to engage in conversation, as well as a mode of expression, experience, and action. As a class community, we’ll work toward developing ties between practices of close reading and writing.Texts may include:Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare (Folger Shakespeare Library Edition)Exercises in Style by Raymond Queneau (Alma Books Special Edition)A course reader will likely contain selections from Jorge Luis Borges’ Collected Fictions, Franz Kafka’s Parables and Paradoxes, David Foster Wallace’s Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, Leslie Jamison’s The Empathy Exams, Sarah Schulman Girls, Visions, and Everything, Clarice Lispector’s Family Ties, and Irmtraud Morgner’s Kaffee Verkehrt; with poetry by Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Emily Dickinson, Christopher Smart, John Ashbery, and César Vallejo; films directed by Pedro Almodóvar and Juliusz Machulski; selections of critical texts and essays by Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Stanley Fish, George Orwell, George Lakoff, Susan Howe, and bell hooks; and readings on writing from Writing Analytically.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Monsters, demons, and other similar ghouls often serve as powerful metaphorical manifestations of social, political, or psychic tensions; as such, they play a key role in numerous literary, cinematic, and other artistic works. In this class, we will be looking at various representations of the monstrous and the demonic in an attempt to better understand what it is, precisely, that they give us: what kinds of ideas do these figures bring to light, and how can they help us refine our own critical thinking? For example, in addition to possessing immense satirical potential, monstrous or demonic figures often allow for an exploration — and transgression — of boundaries, whether it is through the idea of demonic possession or in the form of the age-old fantasy of the human/animal hybrid. Such questions will lay the groundwork for thinking about the monstrous and the demonic through (and with) works by such authors as Nikolai Gogol and Franz Kafka, as well as horror films, including Rosemary’s Baby and It Follows.
This course satisfies the University’s R/C requirement and is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical reading and writing skills. In addition to regular essay assignments—including frequent revisions—students will also learn how to conduct scholarly research and to incorporate this research into their argumentative compositions.

																	In the opening pages of José Asunción Silva’s novel After-Dinner Conversation, the reader encounters a heated discussion between two of the work’s main characters, the poet José Fernández and his doctor friend Oscar Sáenz, about the former’s writer’s block. Oscar, the rational man of science, is quick to identify the source of José’s problem: his constant “prowl for new sensations.” In response, Fernández adamantly declares that all he desires is to “live life! To get drunk on it.” This course asks what it means to “get drunk on life” through the pursuit of sensual pleasure.hedonism, n.The doctrine or theory of ethics in which pleasure is regarded as the chief good, or the proper end of action.-Oxford English DictionaryWhat I thought was happiness was only part-time bliss.-Janet Jackson, “The Pleasure Principle”In the opening pages of José Asunción Silva’s novel After-Dinner Conversation, the reader encounters a heated discussion between two of the work’s main characters, the poet José Fernández and his doctor friend Oscar Sáenz, about the former’s writer’s block. Oscar, the rational man of science, is quick to identify the source of José’s problem: his constant “prowl for new sensations.” In response, Fernández adamantly declares that all he desires is to “live life! To get drunk on it.” This course asks what it means to “get drunk on life” through the pursuit of sensual pleasure. Such a pursuit, to be sure, has long incited lively—and at times violent—debate. Our readings will begin with Ancient Greek philosophies of pleasure and moderation [sophrosyne], and will traverse various centuries and continents. Rather than judge the morality behind certain acts of pleasure-seeking, however, our goal this semester will be to arrive at more nuanced definitions of the terms that structure the conversation. The questions we’ll focus on include the following, among others: What is pleasure, and how has its definition changed over time? What is the relationship between pleasure, desire, and narrative form? Can the pursuit of pleasure be a political gesture? If so, how? What are the shifting norms in relationship to which hedonism gets construed? How do literature and the arts, more broadly, represent and affect our bodily senses? Is there a connection between aesthetic form and hedonism?

																	Daughters: we all either are one or know one. And yet, unlike those other familial categories—mother / father / son—the position and role of the daughter is fairly unexamined. In this class, we will read about many different daughters, dutiful—Shakespeare’s Miranda—and not—Sophocles’ Electra. While “daughter” is a relational name, and we will consider her status with regards to others, we will also attempt to consider the daughter herself, as an isolated concept and being.As this is an R1B, we will practice reading short, theoretical texts that, in addition to daily writing workshops, will help improve argumentative writing all while preparing for the class’s final research paper.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	What gets preserved, lost, and changed in translation? What makes a translation “authentic” or legitimate? This course examines translations that travel across the boundaries of language, literature, and artistic genre. We read writers who translate their own work or take the problem of translation as the subject of their texts.Our readings take us to Russia, the U.S., China, Japan, Poland, and Mexico. How do texts move within and beyond these borders?  How do literature and translation transform these boundaries? Where do we locate a translation that has moved across borders? All texts are in English, and we also discuss the significance of their context, distribution, and audience.As part of the University’s R&C sequence, this course is designed to help students improve their critical writing and reading skills. In addition to regular attendance, reading, and participation, requirements include a series of essays—drafts and revisions—and short response papers.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this class, we’ll look at a number of works of dark comedy, past and present. Reading humor as a reaction to despair or anxiety, we’ll explore how each of these works use comedy to represent and critique real social and political issues.Laughing to Tears: Dark Comedy in Literature and Film“Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that…Yes, yes, it’s the most comical thing in the world.”—Samuel Beckett, Endgame“What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?”—Søren Kierkegaard, Either/OrIn 1940 the French author, André Breton, coined the term “black humor” to describe a number of texts which dwell in this gap between laughter and tears, which take unhappiness and turn it into a joke. Black humor—also known as dark humor or dark comedy—was, for Breton, a way in which literature, art, and film could bring the sufferings and hardships of daily life to the surface, simultaneously offering relief and provoking discomfort. In contradistinction to its sentimental opposite, texts of this genre attempt to represent the most grotesque and serious subject matters by making light of them. They choose, in short, to laugh rather than cry.In this class, we’ll look at a number of works of dark comedy, past and present. Reading humor as a reaction to despair or anxiety, we’ll explore how each of these works use comedy to represent and critique real social and political issues. We’ll look at theoretical work on jokes and humor (Breton, Freud) as well as a number of iconic works of dark comedy in literature and film and more recent, contemporary developments. We will also consider the gender and racial politics of the genre, especially in relation to its “mortal enemy”: sentimentality.As this is an R and C course, its major goals are to improve students’ skills in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, and to explore relationships between these three skills. In addition to participating in class discussion, students will write responses in a variety of forms, including literary analysis essays and creative projects.Possible texts include:Samuel Beckett, EndgameVictor Boy Lindholm, GoldYahya Hassan, Yahya HassanChantal Akerman, “Blow Up My Town”Michael Lehmann, HeathersRoy Andersson, Songs from the Second FloorA course reader will include excerpts from André Breton (Anthology of Black Humor), Sigmund Freud (Jokes and the Unconscious, “Humor”), Søren Kierkegaard (Either/Or), Jonathan Swift, Arthur Rimbaud, W.E.B. Dubois, Ryunosuke Akutagawa, and Patricia Lockwood.

																	In this course we will develop writing and argumentative skills through exploring theoretical and imaginative texts that revolve around technology, science and social order. We will read texts that take up the questions of artificial intelligence and human attachment (Ex-Machina), the relation between justice and techniques of scientific prediction (Foundation, Minority Report), and time travel (The Time Machine) among others. We will watch several contemporary films and read a variety of texts from different historical periods and cultural traditions, focusing specifically on sci-fi and utopian/distopian fiction. The following questions will underlie a few of our discussions: can humans attach to inanimate machines and if so what do such attachments teach us about relationships with humans? Why are we both fascinated and deeply anxious about the possibility of artificial intelligence such as cyborgs and robots? Why do science and scientific innovation are used as models to imagine perfect societies and why such models usually fail? How do sci-fi texts encode implicit utopian wishes and why is the genre a ripe site for such social thinking?We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this course, we will read works of fiction, nonfiction, and theory by contemporary voices who reflect on growing up in the United States in the 21st century.Maybe that’s because when I was a kida white boy told me I was marginalizedand all I could think of was the edgeof a sheet of paper, how empty it is—the abyss I was told never to write into.-Clint Smith, “Queries of Unrest”Course Description:In this course, we will read works of fiction, nonfiction, and theory by contemporary voices who reflect on growing up in the United States in the 21st century. This course is organized by literary genre; we begin with essays and poetry and then move on to novels, memoirs, and film. We will examine these works through an intersectional lens. This means that we will consider race, class, gender, sexual identity, and past trauma simultaneously while reading and analyzing our texts in order to better understand how each aspect of a person’s identity adds nuance and complexity to a person’s life experience. In this course, we will read the voices that have typically been elided from mainstream and canonical American literature. As we read, watch, and listen we will ask ourselves, what does it mean to grow up in the United States today? How do these voices influence and alter our understanding of American literature, history, politics, society?As this is a Reading and Composition course, one of our primary goals will be to build and to refine your ability to construct a cogent analytical argument about a literary text and to support your argument using textual evidence. You will write a total of 32 pages that will consist of various formal writing assignments throughout the semester. You will read 100-150 pages of literary and scholarly texts per week.Possible Texts:Baig, Minhal – Hala (film)Coates, Ta-Nehisi – Between the World and MeCrenshaw, Kimberlé Williams – “Mapping the Margins”Diaz, Junot – “How to Date a Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl, or Halfie”Dick, Kirby – The Hunting Ground (film)Jawort, Adrian L. – “Megapixels and Ringtones”Laymon, Kiese – “How to Slowly Kill Yourself and Others in America”Moore, Lorrie – A Gate at the StairsNair, Mira – The Namesake (film)Packer, ZZ – “Drinking Coffee Elsewhere”Rankine, Claudia – Citizen: An American LyricRees, Dee – Pariah (film)Torres, Justin – We the AnimalsValenti, Jessica – Sex Object: A MemoirVance, J.D. – Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in CrisisWard, Jesmyn – Salvage the BonesA note on the material: In this course, we will explore sensitive topics that include sexual abuse, racial violence, drug addiction, and suicide. Reading and thinking in depth about these issues can be emotionally taxing and triggering for some. I include this warning not to discourage you from taking the course, but to make sure that you are as informed as possible about its content. This being said, I want to emphasize that it is perfectly reasonable and expected to have an emotional response to the texts that we will analyze. It is my intention that the classroom will serve as a safe space in which to acknowledge and to express these emotional responses, while simultaneously functioning as a site of academic rigor. To this effect, please consider that to be a contributing member of our class community entails showing the utmost respect for one another.A note on self-care: If you find the material or the class discussion to be upsetting and would like extra support, please feel free to talk to me about additional self-care resources if you feel comfortable doing so.

																	What significance do we attach to our imitations of others… or another’s work of art? Is there a note of pride, guilt, communion, dialogue, criticism, scorn, or something more like a friendly elbow nudge? This course will consider the components of imitation and its various effects as we unpack literary works that are in some manner cut from the same cloth. The expertise required to articulate subtle differences between works will benefit our main project of conducting written analysis at a more nuanced level.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Brandon Stanton has photographed over 5,000 random people on the streets of New York since 2010. His blog “Humans of New York” has 16 million Facebook followers, and his book by the same title spent 29 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list in 2015.  One of his most famous portraits – of a teenager named Vidal who witnessed a man being pushed to his death from the top of a public-housing tower – generated $1.4 million for Mott Hall Bridges Academy in Brooklyn.  But not everyone Stanton approaches willingly gives him a story. One person told him “These  experiences were so meaningful to me that I don’t want you to soundbite them.” Another: “You’re going to misconstrue what I say.” And still another: “I’m Hustle Man. That’s all you need to know.” (see footnote at bottom).  These responses point towards the voyeurism implicit in art that represents people who are poor or otherwise marginalized.  In supposedly revealing the life of another person, art also renders her a product to be consumed. Our course will examine the problematic scenario in which the consumer is middleclass and the “product” is poverty.We will also explore the different valences of “consumption” in literature about poverty.  The reader is a consumer of the text, but within it people and bodies are also consumed and commodified. In many texts that describe poverty, the physical body figures prominently as the site of suffering and struggle. Bodies can be consumed, by disease and even by other people; the poor sell their bodies as labor or as sex objects.By battering the reader with descriptions of bodily suffering, ugliness, vice, and the inability to escape from material and psychological conditions, narrative representations of poverty evoke sympathy for the characters they describe. But we will also examine the problematics of that sympathy. Is it an inevitably condescending interest in poverty on the part of the middleclass readership? Or is narrative attention to the minutiae of working-class life a democratic strategy for including that class in the public sphere? Thinking about Georg Lukàcs’ seminal essay “Narrate or Describe,” can we say that meticulous description of poverty creates a sense of stasis or potential?  Does it merely portray characters as corpses becoming more corpse-like (Lukàcs’ metaphor)? Or is there something more at stake in portrayals of corporeal abjectness? Is there even a way in which such description could be politically enabling, in the mode of Dickens and other social realists?As a reading and composition class, we’ll use these discussions as a foundation for improving analytical and persuasive writing.Required texts:Vinson Cunningham, “Humans of New York and the Cavalier Consumption of Others”James Agee and Walker Evans, Let Us Now Praise Famous MenLu Xun, “Medicine,” “Tomorrow”Shen Congwen, “Xiaoxiao”Wu Yonggang, The Goddess (film)Lao She, RickshawYu Hua, Chronicle of a Blood Merchant____________________________________________________________Footnote:  This information comes from Vinson Cunningham’s article “Humans of New York andthe Cavalier Consumption of Others” published in The New Yorker, November 3, 2015.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	What does it mean to make sense of literature? Aren’t literary texts precisely those that don’t make immediate sense? Or are they perhaps those that can be made sense of in too many ways? To what degree must we draw on common sense and our shared senses when we read? And to what extent do our particular sensibilities and sensitivities shape our experience of literature?In this class, we’ll grapple with the oppositions between sense and nonsense, prose and poetry, rationality and intuition, masculine and feminine, real and unreal, tradition and the avant-garde, and knowledge and paranoia. We’ll reckon with how sense is made and unmade in poems, plays, novels, songs, and films in order to evaluate the role rationality plays in literature.And, much as we’ll focus on the experience of reading, so too will we focus on the process of writing. We’ll explore the many choices, both simple and sophisticated, that go into communicating interpretations of a literary text to a reader.Required Books:(1)  Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (Norton Critical Edition)

																	In this seminar we will read Horace’s complete works, partly in translation and partly in Latin (the proportions will vary from student to student), in roughly chronological order, possibly spending some extra time with the Odes (but this will depend on the interests of the group).  The goal is to familiarize students with an exceptionally influential body of poetry (and with some of the major trends in the scholarship) and to open up a space for exploring what one might want to make of Horace now.  Thus while the basic trajectory of the class will be set at the outset, the topics for and direction of our weekly discussions will be determined by the diverse preoccupations of the students around the table.  To balance out the “overview” dimension we will slow down each week and lavish special attention on one or two poems.  Therefore to participate in this class you must have some facility in Latin (at a minimum, enough to enable you to work through ca. 30-150 lines of Latin each week with the help of a translation).We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	The history of Western literary theory is often told in terms of the concept of mimesis. But there is another, equally powerful, anti-mimetic strand to this history, and that is the critique of mimesis as a form of idolatry. In this course, we will explore this critique from the prohibition against images in the Hebrew bible up through modern attacks on mimesis as inherently ideological.  Our main literary texts in the first half of the semester will be taken from Reformation England, when there was a fierce debate about the harmful power of images and the necessity of iconoclasm. We will focus on works by Marlowe, Bacon, Shakespeare, and Milton. In the second half of the semester, we will discuss the afterlife of iconoclasm in Marx, Freud, Althusser, Zizek, Adorno, Terry Eagleton, and Isobel Armstrong. Students whose interests lie primarily in national literatures other than English are welcome, and may write their final papers on primary texts and literatures not discussed in class, though they must engage the theoretical texts assigned for the seminar.Required Texts: The Bible (any edition)Saint Augustine, On Christian Doctrine [excerpts will also be available in pdf]

																	The “Carmina Burana” are the most important collection of Medieval Latin (non-religious) lyrical poetry from the High Middle Ages. The carefully redacted anthology contains moral-satirical poems attacking greed, corruption and hypocrisy; erotic love poems revolving around the fraught issue of sexual desire; and a third group with poems (apparently) written by a rebellious group of poets, the “Vagantes” who adopt the personae of hypocrites, false beggars, and outlaws.In this course, we will study these poems thoroughly via a combination of perspectives including philology, manuscript studies, close-reading, literary criticism, contextual analysis, and comparisons with Ancient, Medieval and Modern literary traditions. All in all, we will use our studies as an introduction into the literary culture of the Latin High Middle Ages.Knowledge of Latin (of any level) is a requirement for this course.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	So-called ‘mystical’ forms of thought and experience have played a major role in the history of medieval theology and spirituality.  They also were of importance to modern authors from Hegel to Georg Lukàcs, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, and Jacques Derrida; and from Novalis to Robert Musil, Paul Celan, Ingeborg Bachmann, Pierre Klossowski, to John Cage (to name just a few).  In this seminar we will read and discuss medieval key texts written by Ps. Dionysius Areopagita, Eckhart of Hochheim (Meister Eckhart), Henry Suso, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp, and Angela Foligno, some of the most significant medieval figures in this tradition.  Depending on student interest we can add other authors to this list, e.g., Bernhard of Clairvaux, William of Saint Thierry, Hugh and Richard of Saint Victor.  During a second phase of the seminar we will turn our attention to baroque mysticism, especially Angelus Silesius and Jacob Böhme.  Based on the class discussion and on individual student interests, we will then look into the ways how these texts have been read by 19th and 20th century authors and explore the impact they had on the formation of modern concepts of (and discussions about) subjectivity, affect, and agency.  Depending on student interests, we will decide on a final version of the syllabus at the first meeting of class.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Baroque culture is the first instance in the West of a “global” cultural movement. It also offers the first example of an artistic moment that is truly interdisciplinary. In this seminar we will study the emergence and development of Baroque literature and thought, beginning at the end of the sixteenth century, from Rome to Mexico.  Our approach will have two aspects. On the one hand, we will want to identify and study certain key features of Baroque culture, across languages, continents, and media, working out, as it were, a kind of topography of culture and politics. We will focus on such themes as the theatricalization of power, the role of allegory, the question of a Baroque &quot;style,&quot; imperial and urban experience, and the intersection of arts and disciplines. At the same time, however, we will be interested in the curious history of the &quot;Baroque&quot; in modern critical thought, from the appearance of the term in Art Historical writing at the end of the 19th century (Wöfflin, Burkhardt), through the various nationalist Baroques of the mid-twentieth, the neo-Baroque of certain post-War novelists (Carpentier, Simon), to the critical redemption of Baroque culture for our own moment by the work of Walter Benjamin and Gilles Deleuze.  Among the authors to be studied will be such figures as Shakespeare, Montaigne, Corneille, Galileo, Cervantes, Donne, Caravaggio, Calderón, Tasso, Sor Juana, Pascal, Rubens, Hobbes, Góngora, Bernini, and Gracián.NB: This course may be counted as the required “Methodology” seminar for the REMS Designated Emphasis.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Readings in modern, and above all modern lyric, poetry (much of it from the U.S., but also from Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Near East) in relation to major Frankfurt-School texts on aesthetics, criticism, and social theory that emphasize the significance of literature (as well as the other arts) and especially poetry. Focused concentration on the writings of Walter Benjamin and Theodor W. Adorno, and on their development of Kantian, Hegelian, and Marxian traditions of aesthetics and critical theory. Sustained attention to how and why poetry turns out to be so crucial to the Frankfurters’ (and, in particular, to Benjamin’s and Adorno’s) overall analyses of modernity, mechanical/technical/ technological reproduction and reproducibility (in both the socioeconomic and artistic-aesthetic spheres), and critical agency. Consideration of how Frankfurt-School concerns and legacies might engage the changed sociopolitical circumstances and artistic-aesthetic tendencies—-and the changed poetry—-of the last three decades; analysis in turn of how later-modernist and contemporary poets’ work may challenge Frankfurt analyses of and assumptions about poetry, aesthetic experience, and critical agency themselves. Tracing of the poetry, aesthetics, critical-theory, and sociopolitical histories leading to Adorno’s controversial statements from the late 1940s through 1969 about “Poetry After Auschwitz” (including the ceaseless, prominent international debates those statements caused and have continued to occasion in the poetry-world, the other arts, criticism, and the cultural sphere more generally). Readings of poetry throughout the course will tend to emphasize formal, stylistic, and philosophical-theoretical matters in order to highlight the question of how–and to what degree–artistic technique, in relation to aesthetic form and aesthetic experience (especially lyric experience), may offer stimulus toward and insight into historical, sociopolitical, and ethical understanding and engagement. Some treatment of Romantic and nineteenth-century poetry, and of 21st-century poetry, but the seminar will focus primarily on twentieth-century, modernist poetry (including modernist poetry written and published during the apparently postmodern period).As a shared project throughout the semester, the class will read and continue discussing together in a sustained manner two volumes of poetry: a facing-page, French-English volume containing Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal[1857] and Le Spleen de Paris/Petits Poèmes en Prose [1869]; and Michael Palmer’s Sun [1988]), while, for each week’s class, students and/or the instructor also will have distributed ahead of time xeroxed and/or PDF’d texts of work by other poets (whom they have will have chosen to present to, and discuss with, the rest of the class).Along with the ordered books listed below (which can be purchased at the ASUC Bookstore), xeroxed and/or PDF’d texts will feature critical theory selections from Kant, Marx, the Frankfurters, and others, as well as from many poets, probably including: Vallejo, Duncan, Brecht, Mayakovsky, Ponge, Éluard, Rilke, Neruda, Ginsberg, Zurita, Celan, various Surrealists and Objectivists, WC Williams, Moore, Bishop, Stevens, Paz, Olson, Levertov, Creeley, Ashbery, Guest, O’Hara, Rich, Darwish, Avidan, Morejón, Césaire, Bachmann, Daive, Albiach, Pasolini, and others.[Note: Texts of critical theory, philosophy, aesthetics, and/or criticism will be presented in English translation, though, with texts not initially written in English, we will frequently consider the German, French, Spanish, etc., originals.  Poetry not originally composed in English will be read and discussed primarily in English translation, though we will almost always also consult a poem’s facing-page (or at-hand-xeroxed) original language–most often German, French, or Spanish (as well as other languages, depending on students’ poetry selections). Knowledge of other languages–especially German, French, and/or Spanish—-is not required, though it will prove very helpful.]We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Romanticism was once defined as a turn toward “nature” in response to the industrialization marking Western Europe’s transition to modern capitalism in the early nineteenth century.  Rather than simply resurrecting the idea of the Romantic poets as “nature” poets, we will carefully examine Romantic figures of reflection and grounding, dispersal and dwelling, while also searching for alternatives to the curative role often assigned both “nature” and “poetry” in environmentalist criticism.  Topics will include: the gendering of “nature”; the persistence of commoning practices within industrial modernity; agriculture as a border-space between “culture” and “nature”; the role of memory and imagination in the sense of place and the loss of place; weather-reporting, plant-study and other practices of attention; fantasies about ecological disaster, social catastrophe, and science’s ability to save or destroy humankind.  As we compare different definitions of “nature”—as a set of finite, exploitable resources, a normative authority limiting human experimentation, a repository of traditional ways of doing and knowing, and a site of vulnerability in need of protection from extinction—we will also explore the alternatives to the nature/human binary developed by the writers in question.  Our readings will traverse British, North American, German and French contexts and will include works by Rousseau, Goethe, Blake, Coleridge, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Percy Shelley, Clare, Thoreau, Freud, Heidegger, Adorno and Horkheimer.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	The questions that we’d like to take up in this R1B course are: can literature give us knowledge about other people, especially people of a different class or race? And how does literature signal its own capacities and limitations in providing this kind of knowledge?For the past few years, we (Keru and Taylor) have been thinking about these questions in relation to a literary movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries called naturalism. Naturalist writers believed that it was possible to represent people and society in a scientific way through literature. They wanted to show how social forces and biology determined the way that people’s lives played out, and their subjects were often people of a different social class or race than their middle-class readers. Many of these writers were portraying working-class characters or peasants in hopes of inspiring social reforms.Today the idea that someone succeeds or fails because of her genetic make-up sounds pretty racist or eugenicist, and it is. But we think that many of the issues facing naturalist writers are still very relevant to contemporary attempts at learning about other people. The photographer Brandon Stanton is a good example. He has photographed over 5,000 random people on the streets of New York since 2010 as part of his “Humans of New York” project, but not everyone he approaches willingly gives him a story. One person told him: “These experiences were so meaningful to me that I don’t want you to soundbite them.” Another: “You’re going to misconstrue what I say.” Another: “I’m Hustle Man. That’s all you need to know.” These responses point to the voyeurism implicit in all realist or naturalist forms of art. In supposedly revealing the life of another person, this art also renders her a product to be consumed.In the latter part of the course, we’ll be thinking about the ethics of this voyeurism more intensely. Most of us read about other people, and some write about them, but how can we do so in a way that does not simply treat them as a kind of entertainment or assume they are similar to us in ways that they may not be?In order to do some thinking about these issues, we will have you write two compositions. The first will be a short essay in which you describe someone you know using texts associated with that person. The second will be a longer work in which you will make an argument about one of the novels we read, in conversation with other scholars who have published articles about that novel. Much of our class time will be spent reading literary texts you may want to write about and helping you prepare for these two main projects.Naturalist fiction can be pretty depressing because its characters often meet horrible fates. But we’ve also never been as moved by literature as we have been when reading these novels. We hope you will be as well, and we also hope the class can talk together about how and why these novels invite that kind of investment in their characters. We’re really looking forward to those conversations!Required texts: Mao Dun, Waverings; Li Jieren, Ripple on Stagnant Water; Richard Wright, Native SonCourse website: https://r1b10.wordpress.comWe don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

E-mail: ram@berkeley.eduOffice:           6108 Dwinelle Office Hours: Mon. 11.30-1.30Course Description: What is a hero? What are the origins of the hero as a cultural and literary construct? Originating in myth, the folktale and religious cult-worship, the hero is also present in most literary genres as a central protagonist who acts or is acted upon, and around whom the plot generally revolves. Literary genres determine the kind of heroes that arise, their internal traits and their mode of being in and acting upon the world. This semester we will be examining various types of heroes as they relate to their fictional worlds and to the genres they inhabit: the mythic hero, the tragic hero, the epic hero, the hero of romance, and variants of the romantic hero such as the Gothic and the Byronic. We will be reading extensive literary criticism and some literary and philosophical theory, from Joseph Campbell and Northrop Frye to Hegel, Kojève, and Bakhtin. We will be examining different approaches to literary texts, from traditional historical philology to structuralism, philosophical criticism, and feminism. The course can also be read as a survey of certain aspects of the Western tradition from ancient Greek myth and tragedy, via Milton’s epic, down to nineteenth-century British and Russian romanticism. Throughout the semester we will be following on the heels of the hero Prometheus – rebel and trickster, the stealer of fire and mentor to the human race. Prometheus is the prototypical hero, embodying the collision between human creativity and freedom and the constraints of a social or divine order. He has surfaced at different moments in Western history, from archaic Greece to Athenian democracy to modern Europe in the wake of the French Revolution. The crisis of the Promethean hero delineated by the European romantics allows us to ask what kind of hero – or antihero – is still possible in modern literature.Books to be purchased at the Student Bookstore:Hesiod, Theogony, trans.

																	South and North America share a similar history of conquest, slavery, nation-building, and migration. The works and authors we will read in this course help us think about the ways this history is transmitted, codified and remembered. They ask us, as readers of these texts, to reexamine the history we think we know. Storytelling in the Americas thus acts as a means of rewriting history, thereby opening up the spaces for previously unheard voices to appear and exist.This course will revolve around the following questions:How do literature and other art forms (photographs, music, film) take up history?
How can art stand in for history during periods of silence and repression?
What can short stories, poems, novels, films, photographs, and music TELL us about the past and the present?
Through which mechanisms, formal or otherwise, does art grapple with periods in history overwrought by human rights abuses?
How are these “stories” told, who tells them, why, to what end, for what audience?
What is the relationship between fiction and non-fiction in these works?These are just some of the questions we will be pursuing in this class as we explore these two continents. Students will be expected to contribute weekly writing assignments, participate in class discussion, give one group presentation, and write several essays: a diagnostic essay, one 6-8 page paper, and a final paper 8-10 page research paper. In addition to the reading we will spend time revising, learning how to frame analytical arguments and use research material, peer-editing, and developing critical reading skills.Books for purchase:Kindred by Octavia ButlerTracks by Louise ErdrichDeath and the Maiden by Ariel DorfmanWe will also be watching two films as a class, to be determined by the students from a list provided by the instructor. A course packet will be made available with the many theory articles, short stories, and poems we will be reading in this class.

																	This is a course about absent presences, or entities that refuse to remain hidden in the shadows of history. Straddling the porous border between here and there, past and present, death and life, the undead, or not-quite dead, figures that populate our readings challenge us to rethink the linear unfolding of time. Ghosts, vampires, and zombies: these are the supernatural forces that we’ll encounter this semester. Some carry with them remnants of historical trauma and violence—the residues, reverberations, and reincarnations of slavery, for instance, in Toni Morrison’s Beloved. Others, such as King Hamlet’s ghost in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, lead us to ask what it might mean to mourn—or not to mourn—the loss of a loved one. While most of our readings will take the form of literary works, we’ll also watch a number of films, including Jim Jarmusch’s Only Lovers Left Alive and Ana Lily Amirpour’s A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, paying close attention both to how the undead are represented and what their effects on us are.This course satisfies the University’s R/C requirement and is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical reading and writing skills. In addition to regular essay assignments—including frequent revisions—students will also learn how to conduct scholarly research and to incorporate this research into their argumentative compositions.
Readings will possibly draw from the following (please don’t purchase texts until after our first meeting):Toni Morrison, Beloved
William Shakespeare, Hamlet
Julio Cortázar, “House Taken Over”
Juan Rulfo, Pedro Páramo
Jim Jarmusch (dir.), Only Lovers Left Alive
Ana Lily Amirpour (dir.), A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night
Vladimir Nabokov, “The Vane Sisters”
Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, Carmilla
Zora Neale Hurston, Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica (selections)

																	If Los Angeles, at the center of the culture industry, is charged with representing America to the world, it is also obsessed with representing itself. According to its own mythology, there is no better place than L.A. to realize the quintessentially American dream of leaving the past behind and making one’s own destiny. And if L.A. considers itself the ideal setting for American self-fashioning, it also bills itself as the product of such a process: a city of big dreams and endless possibilities, built against the blank canvas of the desert.Yet this utopian portrayal of Los Angeles obscures its long history as a site of imperial conquest, racial oppression, class struggle, and environmental devastation. This course aims not only to elucidate the various myths associated with the city—from the Hollywood dream of the postwar period to the contemporary celebration of L.A. as global city of the future—but also to allow a more critical understanding of these myths by asking how they intersect with racial and ethnic categories. To whose experiences does each myth give preference? By whom is it created, and for whom? Whose experiences does it exclude?Most of our conversations will be devoted to specific neighborhoods of L.A. (like Hollywood and Watts) and particular traditions of representing the city (as white middle-class fantasy, as border community, as global city). However, we’ll also discuss how a critical understanding of the mythology of L.A. might allow us to reevaluate American myths of newness and self-fashioning more generally.The course asks students to consider the extent to which our perception of a city is shaped not only by physical geography, but also by cultural representation. Accordingly, although the syllabus includes readings in history and urban studies, our discussions will focus primarily on fictional depictions of the city. The course devotes special attention to film, a medium with unique ties to L.A.; students should plan to devote up to 6 hours per week to viewing the films.Required viewing:Thom Andersen, Los Angeles Plays ItselfCharles Burnett, Killer of SheepHaile Gerima, Bush MamaRichard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, QuinceañeraHoward Hawks, The Big SleepGregory Nava, El NorteRoman Polanski, ChinatownRidley Scott, Blade RunnerJohn Singleton, Boyz n the HoodRequired text:Karen Tei Yamashita, 60 (Coffee House Press, 1997)All other readings will appear in a course reader available for purchase at Zee Zee Copy, 2431 Durant Avenue (in the alley between Bancroft and Dana).We will also discuss works in other media, particularly music (including tracks by N.W.A., 2Pac, Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, and others) and visual art (including a number of murals and Sam Rodia’s Watts Towers installation). Links to images and music will be posted to bCourses.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	COMPARATIVE LITERATURE R1B : THE ART IN ARTIFICETuesday & Thursday 12:30-2:00 234 DwinelleAlexandra Brostoff  Office location:  4321 DwinelleTaylor Johnston  Office location:   4416 Dwinellealexandra.brostoff@berkeley.edu taylorjohnston7@berkeley.eduArtifact. Artifice. Artist. The Latin root “art” signifies skill, and conventionally such skill produces an uninterrupted imaginary experience that is meant to approximate reality. But what happens when the artwork calls attention to the skill itself – to its own artistry? In this course, we’ll look at art that persistently reminds us we are experiencing a carefully curated unreality. (For example, you, dear reader, are reading a course description that we’re writing at this very moment!) How and why might a text, film, or performance disrupt artistic conventions by announcing itself as an artificial construction?We’ll begin by discussing meta-fictional texts (and meta-performance) that thematize their own media by commenting on artistic production or advising us in our reading practice (The Tempest; If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler; Three Acts, Two Dancers, One Radio Host). How does meta-fiction transform the role of the reader and the experience of reading (or viewing)?  Does it undermine or empower, alienate or incorporate us?Next, we’ll turn to works that take up the history of their own genres (Une Tempête, Stop Hitting Yourself, Twyla Tharp). Our
discussion of these texts and performances will examine how meaning changes when a work puts itself in dialogue with its predecessors or reconfigures past content and form. Finally, we’ll consider works in which writers give explicit accounts of the artistic process (“Ars-Poetica,” “We Learned the Whole of Love,” How to Write). How can we understand the relationship between these accounts and the art they implicitly describe? In thinking about this question, we’ll have the opportunity to talk with professional writers and poets at Berkeley about the relationship between artists’ descriptions of the artistic process and art.Throughout the course, we’ll be putting literature and performance in comparative dialogue. What changes, for example, when the audience is physically present and immediately responsive to the meta-performance, and not just an abstract recipient as in meta-fiction?  From fiction to poetry to film to theater to dance, this course will track how meta-fictional and meta-dramatic forms impact our experience as readers and viewers and ask how and why artists might choose such techniques. As a reading and composition course, we will use these discussions as a foundation for improving close reading skills and analytical writing.PERFORMANCES AND EVENTSTwyla Tharp 50th Anniversary Tour (8:00 p.m. Oct 16)

Meaningful critical thinking, speaking, and writing require students to have an open mind and to treat others with respect. Different views are not only inevitable, but essential in creating a dialogue that promotes real analysis and understanding. To this end, our class must be an environment in which all feel comfortable sharing their perspectives. If you feel uncomfortable about your own participation in class, or about the participation of another student, please come see us in our offices.PARTICIPATIONParticipation is an incredibly important aspect of this course and consequently is a large percentage of your grade. All successful analysis and writing begins with confusion, questions, or uncertainty. Class time should therefore be an opportunity to freely explore
issues that a text raises, to pose questions, and to hypothesize about what something might mean. There truly are no “wrong” comments, so no matter what your experience or comfort level with literature and performance might be, your perspective will be invaluable. If you are nervous about participating and/or public speaking in general, please come talk with us in office hours as soon as possible – we can brainstorm ways to make you feel more comfortable in class and consider alternative methods of participation.Coming unprepared to class is disrespectful to your instructors and peers, not to mention a waste of your own time. It is impossible to benefit from a literature class unless you have read the assigned reading at least once and come prepared with 1-2 questions and comments. The discussion questions that we will email at the end of every week are designed to help you generate these questions and comments. If students regularly attend class without preparation, we will have unannounced reading quizzes.ATTENDANCEStudents may take up to three absences with no consequences. After that, absences will severely affect the participation grade. There is no need to notify us via email if you plan to be absent. We expect that you budget your own absences to account for days when you may feel ill, need to travel, or have too many other academic demands. If you need to be absent for more than three classes due to a medical or family emergency, please get in touch with us about possible arrangements.Arriving to class late more than two times will also count as an absence. Please speak to us if you are coming a far distance to class everyday. Missing more than one of the scheduled performances will count as an unexcused.  You are responsible for material you miss during an absence. We ask that you come see us in office hours or consult another student in the course about the material you
missed rather than emailing.FORMAL ESSAY FORMAT12-point Times New Roman; 1 inch margins; double-spaced; full name, course name, and paper title on front page (single-spaced header); page numbers on every page; stapled and included in the Writing Portfolio folder (see below).THE WRITING PORTFOLIOWriting is always a process and, as such, your writing in this course will be evaluated not only as individual assignments but also holistically from the beginning of the semester to the end. Improvement in your writing from your first paper draft to your final paper will be reflected in your overall grade, as will your effort and conscientiousness in revision and in office hours attendance. At the beginning of the semester, along with the first close reading exercise, each student will be asked to hand in a standard folder with pockets labeled with her name. This folder will become the student’s writing portfolio. Every writing assignment must be turned in with this folder and all comments will be returned in the folder with all the student’s other writing assignments. This will allow both you and us to look back at previous successes and areas that need improvement.WRITING WORKSHOPSIn order to help students improve their critical writing and reading, we will focus on these skills in frequent workshops; students will practice “close reading” and different aspects of composition in the context of the texts we’ll be discussing. Once a specific topic is
covered in class, students are expected to implement what they have learned in their writing assignments, and grading will consequently reflect this policy.PERFORMING ARTS WORKSHOPSThroughout the semester, we will be visited by several teaching artists and other professionals working in media and performance who will give students the opportunity to practice as performers themselves. These workshops will be led by Rica Anderson (Education Programs Manager at Cal Performances), Jill Randall (Dance Teacher at the Hamlin School), and Sam Harnett (Reporter at KQED, Marketplace, and The World).
PLAGIARISM“Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source,” for example:
“Wholesale copying of passages from works of other authors into your homework, essay, or paper without acknowledgement. Use of the views opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment. Paraphrasing of another person’s characteristic or original phraseology, metaphor, or other literary device without acknowledgement.”—From the Student Guide published by Student Judicial Affairs
See the Student Judicial Affairs website which explains, in detail, what is considered academic honesty at http://students.berkeley.edu/osl/sja.asp. We have a no tolerance policy for plagiarism in this class. Copying another work is not only unfair to the original author, but also undermines the effort and time your colleagues have put into their own assignments and
prevents us from measuring your actual abilities. Any plagiarized paper will automatically
receive an F.LATE PAPERSThe ability to craft an informed and critical piece of writing within a specific amount of time is equally as important as the piece of writing itself. Late papers will receive a grade lower for every day they are late. If you are concerned about meeting a paper deadline, you must contact us about your issue at least one week ahead of time.ACCOMMODATION POLICYFollowing university policy, students needing an accommodation must provide us with a letter from the Disabled Students Program detailing what particular accommodations are necessary. Without such a letter, cell phones and laptops are not permitted during
class and we will not be able to grant other kinds of accommodations.TUTORINGStudents are highly recommended to take advantage of the writing services available, free of charge, at the Student Learning Center in the Chavez Student Center. See http://slc.berkeley.edu for more information, or call 510.642.7332.OFFICE HOURSWe strongly encourage students to come into office hours before each draft is due to discuss revision strategies. Failure to take advantage of this aspect of the revision process will inevitably affect a student’s ability to strengthen her writing and improve her grade. We also encourage you to stop by if something was not clear in class, if there was a theme you wanted to talk about in further detail, or if you have any questions or interests relating to the class more generally. Office hours are a great opportunity to strengthen your grasp on this semester’s difficult concepts, so take advantage of them!EMAIL POLICYRegularly checking your email will be important to your success in this class. We will send weekly announcements about reading and writing assignments, updates to the syllabus, and attendance at events and performances. Please make sure you read these and respond promptly with any questions to ensure that our busy semester goes smoothly.  We will get back to emails within 24 hours (or 48 over the weekend). Emails asking for detailed assistance with papers will not be accepted. Instead, the student should schedule an
office hours appointment, which will be much more productive for such exchanges. This does mean that major, conceptual questions about a paper must be addressed at least a few days before the due date; thesis statements and last minute revisions sent via
email before a paper is due will not be read.SCHEDULE OF READINGS AND ASSIGNMENTSThursday, August 27

																	Did you ever wonder how other people get their work done? Or what great ideas look like and where they come from? Are you curious about the best strategies and habits for clear, forceful, and engaging writing? This seminar about writing and publishing is for you. You must have a seminar paper that you wish to revise in the course of the semester. You must also commit to sending your revised essay out for review by a journal at the end of the fall. The vast majority of our time will be spent discussing the written work of the seminar members. We will also read and discuss some important articles in the fields of English and Comparative Literature and analyze how and why they work. There will be a number of guest visits by Berkeley faculty who will discuss their writing habits and their own work in progress. Enrollment is limited to 12 students.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	In this course we will study medieval and early-modern manuscripts as complex intersections of materiality, aesthetics, politics, and institutionality. In a first part, students will be introduced into the fundamentals of codicology, paleography, and manuscript illumination: a hands-on phase for which we will use real manuscripts from Berkeley’s Bancroft Library. In addition, we will discuss some seminal critical work on the cultural dynamics of manuscripts. After this introductory part, our class will explore selected cases and genres such as medieval bibles, books of hours, poetic anthologies, and manuscripts with scientific texts. In the third part of the course, students will pursue their own research in collaboration with the instructors.

																	The earth—as we know it today—may cease to exist in the future. With this possibility arises the pressing need to rethink nature in the Anthropocene—the era in which human activities have had a significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems, especially since the advent of James Watt’s steam engine in the late 1700s. The Fate of Nature in the Anthropocene Collaborative Research Seminar brings together faculty and graduate students from the humanities and environmental sciences to develop a theoretical framework for the environmental humanities and to examine possibilities for an integrated approach to the recent environmental turn in the humanities.The Fate of Nature in the Anthropocene seminar explores the complex meanings of the term Anthropocene and considers new and plural understandings of nature, the nature-culture web, and a post-human techno-nature. The term Anthropocene will be taken as shorthand for a series of ecological and social crises facing humanity in the twenty-first century and beyond. Through the lens of the Anthropocene, the seminar will address key issues for the environmental humanities, such as climate change, energy sources, biotechnology, agricultural production, and environmental justice, and investigate how new theories of ethics and justice can be made applicable to resolving large-scale, complex environmental problems.Conveners:Anne-Lise François (English and Comparative Literature) and Carolyn Merchant (Environmental Science, Policy, and Management)Participants:Justin Brashares (Environmental Science, Policy, and Management), Mel Y.

																	This course revolves around the reception of classical myth and literature, focusing on what seems to be an unlikely mythical figure — Herakles.Herakles, the slayer of men (and attacker of gods) may seem a simple, one-dimensional character, an embodiment of raw physical power triumphing over twelve nearly impossible labors.  Liberating others, slaying monsters, and surviving sojourns to the underworld, he seems to be an Ancient super-man, whose strength can be reinterpreted as mental discipline and self-control: Herakles represents power, courage, control, heroism.  This, however, is only one side of a hero who is more complicated than it seems. Situated in a hybrid realm between the gods and man, this demi-god was also an embodiment of excess, savagery, and arrogance: he looses his temper and sanity; kills and maims innocents, including his closest family; and can be weak: in comic portrayals he looses his dignity when drunken; he is falls desperately for women; and, despite being the “best of all men”, has to serve a much weaker relative.  Full of tensions and ambiguities, this figure thus provokes complex questions about the ambivalences of heroism, power, trauma, desire, and gender.In this course, we will study how Ancient and post-Ancient poets used the figure of Heracles to engage in such questions. Altogether we will read works by Pindar, Sophocles, Euripides, Vergil, Seneca; medieval and Renaissance poems about Herakles; and modern treatments by Hoelderlin, Ezra Pound, and Peter Weiss. Students will receive a thorough introduction into the epochs, genres and contexts behind our texts; and will learn how classical texts were read and re-interpreted within specific intellectual, aesthetic, institutional, and  political frameworks, and as part of changing conceptions of what ‘Antiquity’ meant during different periods. All our texts will be made available via an electronic course reader.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	The 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution seems an ideal moment to go back and examine the history and literature of revolutionary Russia. This was an era of violent upheaval, material destitution and radical projections of social renewal and human transformation. We will be tracing the arc of the first revolutionary decade, from the revolutionary upsurge of 1917 and the Civil War of 1918-1921, which saw the ultimate consolidation of Soviet power, to the early and often contradictory formulations of Soviet culture arising over the course of the 1920s. Our course will focus primarily on the relationship between literature and revolution, a vital question given the importance paid to written culture by Bolsheviks and non-Bolsheviks alike. How did the writer bear witness to the first socialist revolution in history? Is revolution an event or a process, and how might it be narrated? Is literature a mirror of history or can it also serve actively to shape change? How did the principal literary genres – poetry, drama, the short story and the novel – serve the goal of imaging the revolution? How did political and literary theory animate the debates of the time? Was there room for satire and laughter in a socialist society? If the 20th century can be deemed the era of utopia and dystopia, what does Russian literature teach us about the hopes and failures of revolutionary  ransformation? Writers and thinkers we will be reading include John Reed and Victor Serge, Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Velimir Khlebnikov, Isaak Babel and Boris Pilnyak, Viktor Shklovsky and Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Zoshchenko and Yuri Olesha, Evgeny Zamyatin and Andrei Platonov.

																	Once considered primarily a form of education and/ or propaganda, the documentary film is enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the 21st century as a form of entertainment and art. In an age crazed with reality television and celebrity biographies, the documentary genre throws into relief a number of questions that have long animated literature, photography, and film: What does it mean to show a life “as it really is”, to tell a story “as it really happened”? How can authenticity be measured and proven, and what responsibility does a storyteller have to do so? What are the ethical demands and pitfalls of telling someone else’s story, and how are these related to the fraught quests for objectivity, authenticity, and fidelity to “the truth”? Where does the line between art and document lie?These are just a few of the questions we will be exploring while examining texts from a wide range of time periods and cultural traditions. In fulfillment of the Reading and Composition requirement, this class aims to improve the students’ abilities to write clearly, effectively, and accurately about subjects of intellectual complexity in order to prepare them for the demands of college-level coursework.  This class also emphasizes the inherent value of the critical reading and critical thinking skills that make such writing possible. To these ends, significant class time will be devoted to the skills required to build an argument about a literary text and to write a clear and compelling argumentative paper.Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. read texts from a wide variety of literary genres closely and critically.
2. present their analyses and interpretations of these texts orally in class discussion.
3. communicate close readings and interpretations of literary texts in convincingly argued and well written essays.
4. organize a research paper around a literary text and successfully locate and incorporate relevant secondary sources.
5. reflect critically on their own written work as they draft and revise essays.Required Texts (Available for purchase at the campus bookstore)Other assigned readings can be found in the course reader, available for purchase at
Krishna Copies 2111 University Ave. These include short works by Gabriel García
Márquez, Julio Cortázar, Gustave Flaubert, and Zora Neale Hurston, and selections from
Plato’s Republic, William Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads, and from the critical work of Susan Sontag, John Beverley, Elzbieta Sklodowska, William Stott, Brian Winston, Louise Spence and Vinicius Navarro.Students will also be required to view 9 films.
These films will be available for viewing in the Media Resources Center and/ or screened on campus during the week for which they are assigned.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	According to the historical legend, Martin Luther posted 95 thesis about the reform of the Church on the doors of the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517. These theses, published 500 years ago, were quickly reprinted, translated, and distributed throughout Germany and Europe. They are often seen as the starting point of the Reformation that not only changed the understanding of Christian teachings but also had a great influence on European culture and thought. In this course we read and discuss Luther’s basic writings, the ways in which he teaches the reading of the Bible, and his influence on the history of modern thought and culture.

																	If one accepts that all language is conventional, how do authors continually manage to produce literary works that have the power to charm and surprise us? This course approaches the question by addressing one conventional dimension of literary works: genre. Rather than tracing a single literary genre through its formation, development, and dissolution, this course considers several genres (the family tragedy, the gothic novel, the noir film) side by side to get at whether one can distinguish how they are generic. Is it the case that works of the same genre are necessarily concerned with the same subject matter? Do they share a typical structure? A certain look? A set of techniques for making meaning? Convey a special feeling?By juxtaposing canonical works of a genre with particular permutations of it, we will explore how texts produce meaning not only semantically (through a series of grammatical statements), but also indexically by evocatively pointing to other works. Juxtaposing works of different genres also gives students the opportunity to question how genres overlap, drawing on and responding to not only works of the same genre, but also a broader archive of texts. The opportunity to think about genres in relation to each other leads into thinking about them in relation to literary modes such as realism. Ultimately students will have to decide for themselves what status to give the term genre: Is it constitutive of texts – part of how works conceive of themselves and produce meaning? Is it a product of the juxtapositions that we as readers construct – by, for instance, putting works together on a syllabus)? Is it an effect of markets – the fact that readers’ expectations influence authors’ writing and that texts are marketed in ways that readers will recognize? If so, what gives some works the power to define a genre?Focusing on literature, film, and criticism, this course will explore these questions as a way to develop students’ critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. With these goals in mind, members of this course will be asked to illustrate the development of their thinking on course topics through regular expository writing assignments, re-writes, frequent free-writing exercises, periodic posts to a bcourses forum, and consistent in-class participation.Required texts:Henry James, The Turn of the Screw

																	A recent book of literary criticism on nature poetry by John Felstiner bears the title Can Poetry Save the Earth? Without taking a positon on Felstiner’s urgent question, this course will be structured around a series of questions implicit within it: What effects does reading about nature, or looking at visual representations of the natural world, have on our experience of our physical surroundings and our encounters with nonhuman forms of life? Does nature poetry and landscape painting (or nature photography) intensify our experience of nature’s aliveness and beauty and mystery, deepening our feeling of connection to it? Does the mode of sustained attention and imaginative participation specific to the study of literature and art carry over in some significant way to our perception and appreciation of the natural world? What distinguishes literary and aesthetic engagements with the natural world from other forms of discourse such as scientific and activist writing?As well as serving as an introduction to nature-centered literature and art, this will also be a writing intensive course in which students will develop the skills of analytical writing through a series of textual analyses and formal essay assignments.Required texts:David Malouf, An Imaginary Life (Vintage)Keith Holyoak, trans.

																	In this course we will study the relationship between obsession and identity, personal and/or national. Obsession according to Merriam Webster Dictionary is: “ A persistent disturbing preoccupation with someone or something or with an often unreasonable idea or feeling” and the Miller-Keane Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health: “A recurrent persistent thought, image or impulse that is unwanted and distressing (ego-dystonic) that comes involuntarily to the mind despite attempts to ignore or suppress it.”In Obsession:  A History, Lennard J.Davis brings out the component of close observation embedded in the concept and in the term deriving from the Latin “obsessio” and allied to the acquisitiveness and dominance of the Latin “possessio.” These particular verbal expressions, in their context, were used to describe war situations and the taking of cities.Despite the fact that the selected novels are distinctly different in style, content, written by, both, male and female authors, and belong to different chronological periods in Greek literary history, the dynamics of the relationship between obsession and the struggle for identity are remarkably similar.In all the selected fiction, the keen, unwavering focus of obsession conceals an identity crisis during which the subject experiences the undoing of selfhood, his/her distinct identity in the world, as the subject has known it.  As such, the absorption into the obsession allows for the energy of compulsion to construct a new world which the character can control by delimitation and exclusion of elements outside of it. Thus, by limiting the dynamics of the world that has challenged his or her identity, the subject, now, can recreate that identity in the newly constructed world and in relation to the focus of obsession.Even though psychoanalysis itself gained legitimacy gradually in Greece, particularly after the 1950s, with the increasing appearance of Freud’s works into Greek translations, all the selected authors from the end of the 19th to the 21st century are familiar with psychotherapy and psychoanalytic practices.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	The onset of modernization in Greek society, after the War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire, albeit a belated one, brought about an increased contact with, and an imitation of, different European cultures. It also brought about an accelerated movement toward secularization. Earlier, the secular ideological ground for the War of Independence which was reflected in the writings of Rigas Velestilis (Pheraios), at the end of the eighteenth century, and Hellenic Rule of Law: A Discourse on Freedom, written anonymously, under obvious French influence, and published in Italy in 1806, envisioned the secular society that was supposed to emerge at the war’s end.Nevertheless, the complex relationship of interdependence between Greek culture and Orthodoxy, and their common, deep roots in the support of the Orthodox Church by Byzantine rule and, later, by the theocratic Ottoman governance, continued to remain evident. In fact, the complexity of this relationship can be clearly seen in the Greek fiction of the 19th century and of a large part of the 20th century.This complexity manifests itself in terms of tension between secular and religious elements, between secularism, reinforced within the European­-inspired Greek intellectual circles, and traditional religion with its corresponding social attitudes. As such, it is played out in Greek novels, whether of village or of urban setting, primarily regarding the roles of men and women characters. It is precisely this type of tension that perseveres, even on the face of 20th century Marxist ideology, and contributes to the anxiety and irresoluteness which characterize Modern Greek fiction in the 19th century.Note: All Greek materials are also available in English translation. Films are in English, or with English subtitles. In the beginning of the semester, a series of readers will be made available to students.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	Session D:  July 3rd-August 11th.This course will trace the legacy of an American genre, the horror story, from the nineteenth century to the present.We begin with famous writers of the American Renaissance (Hawthorne, Irving, Poe) and inquire about why the horrors of Dark Romanticism are at the very roots of American literary culture. What is it about the cultural and physical landscape of nineteenth-century United States that makes it so fertile for the writing of horror? In what ways are the horrors of nineteenth-century American history (slavery, settler colonialism, empire) registered and represented in Gothic and supernatural stories, and in what ways do they remain merely “specters”? What can the horror story of the nineteenth century teach us about racial dynamics then and in the present?We then move to the Hollywood classics of horror cinema and evaluate the horror film’s capacity to interrogate (or, at times, perpetuate) American social ills. Our task is to analyze how classic horror films represent gendered power dynamics, make manifest repressed sexual desire, lampoon cultures of consumerism and suburbanization, and examine (and/or deploy) the fear of racial, ethnic, or national Others.In the second part of the course, we will consider the plurality of cultural histories and identities to which the horror genre gives voice. We will read fiction and watch films by Indigenous, Black, Chicano and Asian American authors and filmmakers that represent histories of immigration, displacement, discrimination, and social and economic marginalization. We will consider not only how these works respond to historical and social realities, but also how they critically retool the horror genre as a means of enriching social imaginaries.Possible Texts Include:Washington Irving, “The Devil and Tom Walker”Stephen Vincent Benét, “The Devil and Daniel Webster”Nathanial Hawthorne, “Young Goodman Brown”Edgar Allen Poe, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (excerpts)Merien C.

																	Session D:  July 3rd-August 11th.“I’ve seen justice for all genders and classes and sexualities, and it was as alien to me as the extra-terrestrial creatures who practiced it. This image of justice sprang from my own imagination, taking place on another planet, in another time, for a species of people very unlike humans. It took science fiction for me to see a clear picture of what justice could be. And at the end of the day, that’s all it was – fiction.” — Maisha JohnsonThis course will trace an American tradition of science fiction writing from the antebellum period to the present. Focusing on films, novels, and especially short stories, the course serves as an introduction to the genre and as an exploration of the insights that science fiction offers as an object of socio-cultural analysis. The course specifically develops students’ understanding of the forms and tropes that define science fiction and connects these to a critical language for discussing matters of ethnic and racial diversity in the history of the United States. With these goals in mind, the course examines the development of a genre while situating works within their socio-cultural and historical contexts.The central questions that structure the course proceed from the fundamental paradox that attends the genre: How do we imagine something different from what we have? What allows the science fiction story to establish, with remarkable economy, a vision of a world? How do we recognize similarities and locate differences between historical circumstances and the circumstances represented in science fiction? What kinds of desires and fears do the worlds of American science fiction enact? When do they do so critically as opposed to unthoughtfully, and how do we tell the difference? How have indigenous, African, latino/a, and Asian American writers and filmmakers given form to their marginalized experiences and to radical political projects for social justice through science fiction? Is science fiction able to broaden the range of possible ways cultural diversity can be imagined, or only change its guise?Course Structure:We begin with famous writers of the pre-Civil War and American Renaissance periods to inquire why the age gives rise to visions of technological advancement, human perfectibility through biological modification, and punished hubris. We will focus on how and why excitement and anxiety about industrialization appears again and again alongside fear of slave rebellion. We will likewise examine works of the same period that give shape to early visions of American black nationalism.In the second unit of the course, we read works that emerge from the legal and institutional xenophobia of the early twentieth century in the U.S. The fictions read in this unit address questions of demographic transformation and projects that seek to manage it. We will continue to pursue the way that science fiction creates new worlds but will take up the additional goal of describing science fiction’s relation to satire.We then turn our attention to science fiction after the American Civil Rights movement. Here the course will examine the way fictions of the period generate both post-racial fantasies and visions of interracial harmony. Special attention will be given to how works reflect an increased interest in precisely locating racial and ethnic difference in the mind and/or the body.The course concludes by bringing a plurality of perspectives to bear on the qualities that fundamentally distinguish science fiction. For instance, how do attempts on the part of indigenous people to disentangle native science from “primitive” knowledge and myth change the scope of the genre? How does a narrator’s insistence on its radical sexual difference present barriers to what a reader can know about a possible world? We consider not only how these works critique contemporary social organizations, but also how they reframe the science fiction genre as a means of enriching the social imaginary. This unit will also address a problem of generic interpretation that arises at the intersections of cultural difference: not all literature that can be interpreted as science fiction is written as science fiction. It may read as such for some people while for others it represents a contemporary lived reality. Thus to read a work as science fiction can be to appropriate its way of meaning or to place it at a distance at a distance from reality. To help us approach these works with care, we will read them alongside critical and theoretical texts by scholars of feminist, Native-American, African-American, and queer studies.Texts:Zainab Amadahy, The Moons of PalmaresRay Bradbury, “The Other Foot”Octavia Butler, “Bloodchild”Martin R.

																	Session D:  July 3rd-August 11th.Who are America’s heroes? Are they caped crusaders and cowboys, or are they of a more ordinary sort – oddball schoolmasters like Ichabod Crane and country lawyers like Atticus Finch? In this class, we’ll explore the question of American (both Northern and Southern) heroism by asking whether, how, and why America looked (or perhaps needed?) to create heroes that were different from the chivalric knights and epic warriors – including the Vikings that reached America – of the Old World(s).To explore these questions, we’ll consider a wide variety of heroes – from cross-dressing conquistadors to female Korean revolutionaries, wanna-be cowboys to comic book superheroes – as well as their broad range of fans – from Holocaust survivors to a first-generation Dominican American teen. With an eye toward contemporary American popular culture, we’ll also think about why in the last decade we’ve seen the simultaneous rise of the Anti-Hero in cable television (The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Dexter, etc.) along with the return of comic book Superheroes in film (The Dark Knight, The Avengers, etc.).From a cultural perspective, we’ll ask how heroes reflect and respond to society’s values and anxieties, as shaped by politics, race, and gender. Do heroes operate within society’s bounds of convention and authority (perhaps even reifying social norms and hierarchies) or are they, as they often portray themselves to be, defenders of the downtrodden, perhaps even figures with revolutionary social potential? With such questions in mind, our exploration of heroism will be placed within larger questions of “myth-making” and “mythologies” that seek to ask how America (or the Americas) understands itself, its past, and its future. If a hero can function as a symbol of cultural or national unity, can heroism also tell us about the divisions within American society, be it the divide between indigenous Amerindian populations and later settlers, the north/south split(s), or divisions of class, race and ethnicity?Our exploration of such topics and questions will lead us to consider both major literary texts and films as well as comics, graphic novels, and television episodes, either in their entirety or excerpted. We will have a course reader with shorter texts and theoretical essays; major texts may be selected from among the following:Literature –The Vinland Sagas, The Norse Discovery of America: “Graenlendinga Saga” and “Eirik’s Saga”Catalina de Erauso: Lieutenant Nun: Memoir of a Basque Transvestite in the New WorldWashington Irving:  The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Other Stories American Indian Myths and Legends (edited by Richard Erdoes and Alfonso Ortiz)Mark Twain:  Pudd’nhead Wilson and Those Extraordinary TwinsTeresa Hak Kyung Cha:  DictéeMichael Chabon:  The Adventures of Kavalier and ClayJunot Diaz:  The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar WaoFilm and Television –The Man Who Shot Liberty ValenceThe SearchersHigh NoonTo Kill a Mockingbird (plus excerpts from the novel)O Brother, Where Art Thou?The Sopranos Comp Lit N60 003 AC: 美国神话：超级英雄、反派英雄、普通群众美国的英雄是谁？是十字军、牛仔？还是那些更普通的人——伊卡博德·克兰那样 的奇怪校长还是阿提克斯·芬奇那样的乡村律师？在这节课中，我们将探讨一同美国（北 方和南方）英雄主义，思考美国是否会、如何、为何要（或可能需要？）创造不同于骑士 和史诗战士的英雄形象？为了探究这些问题，我们将考虑各种各样的英雄：从跨界征服者到韩国女性革命家，从渴望出名的牛仔到漫画超级英雄以及大量英雄粉丝，从大屠杀幸存者到第一代多米尼 加裔美国青少年。着眼当代美国流行文化，我们还将思考为何过去十年中美剧（《黑道家 族》，《绝命毒师》，《嗜血法医》等）中的反派英雄与电影中（《黑暗骑士》，《复仇 者联盟》等）的漫画超级英雄同时回归。从文化的角度来看，我们也许会问英雄形象如何反映和回应由于政治，种族和性别 所塑造的社会价值观和社会焦虑。英雄形象们是否社会公约与授权内（甚至可能会改变社 会规范和阶层）运作，还是他们常常成为受压迫群体的守护者，又或是具有革新社会潜力 的人物？鉴于这些问题，我们将对被英雄主义的探索放在更广的论题“神话制造”和“神话” 中，试图追问美国（或美洲）该如何理解自己、过去和未来。如果英雄可以作为文化或民 族团结的象征，英雄主义也可以告诉我们美国社会中的分歧，无论是美洲印第安人和后来 定居者之间的分歧，南北分裂，还是阶级、种族和民族差异？We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	This course is designed to introduce you to the most exciting literary and cultural moment in twentieth century America: modernism, the Jazz Age, the emergence of big city culture, the rise of a political left. This is the time of migrations from the South to the North, of exile and off-shore displacements through which American artists and writers stretched the boundaries of their local towns to open a world conversation about art and, never on the side, about race and gender. This is the debut of an avant-garde in music and literature, of radical experiments with poetry and performance; it signals the rise of new technologies, especially radio and film.The early decades of the twentieth century also mark the moment of radical politics in the USA staged against anti-immigrant laws and the repression of minority cultures. At times, the arts expose the failures of politics and the law; at other times, they bring forward the ghosts of history that most people had hoped to forget. As an ensemble, they touch unspoken truths and teach us new ways to read and listen.Our course will investigate the ways in which different political questions surrounding ethnicity and race gain a presence in modernist literature. In particular, we will focus on that kind of literature that affirms and interrogates the power of voice. We’ll see how “voice work” (orality, bilingualism, the art of gossip or translation, voice as performance) challenges the authoritative speech that claims to define the nation while it also creates a new authority for the minor or “outsider” speaker. In this way, literary voice–with its underside of silence and secrets–becomes the center of a radical innovation in style, and often competes with the power of voice claimed by radio and film. We see this in the language experiments of Gertrude Stein and the “newsreel” novels of John Dos Passos, in the prose fiction of Harlem Renaissance writers Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen who explored orality along with concepts of self-affirmation and passing; in the poetry of William Carlos Williams and Frank Lima who as Puerto Rican writers living in New York transformed their Hispanic roots through writing.Our route takes us from California to New York and then to Southern borders, where a migration of Mexicans to California and Texas gives rise to new poetry and song; others seek to explore the blackness by seeking connections to the Caribbean islands. In these cases, a bilingual impulse redefines the modernist reach, and sets the stage for the Nuyorican poets of the 1970s. The course ends with William Faulkner’s Absalom, Absalom!, a magisterial novel about North/South relations, race, secrets and incest, all told through contradictory voices that stutter or shout as they stumble through national history.On Fridays, 4 sections to be taught by GSIs Matt Gonzales and Tara PhillipsRequired Texts;Dos Passos, John.

																	What makes American history, and why would we want to—need to—remake it? This course explores literary and visual materials produced in the post-Civil Rights U.S. by artists and writers who ponder this question and approach history like a raw material that demands to be refashioned and constantly problematized. What versions of American history have they remade, and what new versions and visions of history do they produce in the process? How has re-making history been used to gain a critical understanding of silences and omissions in the United States’ story? What are the limits to historical revision and reconstruction, and how do these coexist alongside the need to experiment with imaginative modes of repurposing history through writing and visual culture?With these questions in mind, we will begin by studying Octavia Butler’s neo-slave narrative Kindred, which revisits and remakes the nineteenth-century slave narratives that created a literary space for African-American slaves to circulate their testimonies and elicit support for the abolitionist cause. Reading excerpts from slave narratives by Harriet Jacobs and Frederick Douglass alongside Butler’s novel, we will consider how Butler rewrites a fundamental literary genre of the nineteenth-century United States, remaking it in a way that questions history’s malleability, while also underscoring the role that race plays in deciding who makes American history and who is granted power to re-make or re-imagine it.From there, we will move to Saidiya Hartman and Carrie Mae Weems’ experiments with reading and reconstructing ‘lost’ histories out of archival materials. Reading Hartman’s genre- bending blend of autobiography and history Lose Your Mother, we will consider Hartman’s move to intertwine personal and collective stories, African and African-American histories, and narratives of past and present, all while marking the incomplete and indeed impossible task of recreating slavery’s history from archival records. Similarly concerned with absences and erasure, Carrie Mae Weems’ multimedia art installation The Hampton Project pieces together visual and poetic fragments, creating a co-history for African Americans and Native Americans through a collage of poems, audio, and recycled photographs from a World Fair Expedition used to promote U.S. re-education campaigns at the turn of the twentieth century. If Weems’ installation mourns how Native and African-American subjects were forcibly reshaped to become ‘Americans’ through campaigns like these, her art also refashions this history in an openly fragmented and incomplete way, undercutting a totalizing mode and exposing the erasures in the nation’s archives.As we continue to trace this tension between re-purposing American history and recognizing what cannot be known or recovered, we will then close the semester with a unit of fiction, film, and performance art that juxtaposes explicitly revisionist works with ones that probe the ethics of reconstructing histories. We will study Chicana feminists’ (Sandra Cisneros, Cherrie Moraga) rewritings of La Malinche and other archetypes that they borrow and transform from sixteenth-century narratives of Spanish conquest, plus performance art pieces by Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Coco Fusco that push archetypal representations of ‘Native’ Americans to their outrageous extreme, performing a resistant response to Christopher Columbus’ account of Amerindians to protest the official commemorations of the 500-year anniversary of his landing in the Americas. We will watch Luis Valdez’s 1981 film that reaches back to 1940s Los Angeles to provide a counter-history of the Zoot Suit Riots, as well as read Alice Walker’s “Everyday Use,” which wonders whether reimagining history necessitates rethinking the kinds of materials and modes that we deem worthy of making history in the first place. Sherman Alexie’s short story will ask us to contemplate whether a stolen history can be ‘redeemed,’ and our final novel, Junot Díaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, will question the redemptive power of re-making history while battling to recuperate ‘minor’ histories that might otherwise never be told. By elevating the story of a Dominican-American immigrant family to the level of national epic, Díaz’s bildungsroman highlights the pressing need to not only revise and multiply America’s histories, but also to explore alternative strategies for making history as well.Reading List:Kindred, Octavia ButlerExcerpts from Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Harriet JacobsExcerpts from Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Frederick DouglassExcerpts from Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route, Saidiya Hartman“Venus in Two Acts,” Saidiya Hartman“Everyday Use,” Alice Walker“What You Pawn I Will Redeem,” Sherman Alexie“Lullaby” and selections from The Storyteller, Leslie Marmon Silko“La Carta de Colón,” Christopher ColumbusSelected stories from Woman Hollering Creek, Sandra CisnerosExcerpts from Loving in the War Years, Cherrie MoragaThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot DíazFilm & Visual Materials:The Hampton Project art installation, Carrie Mae WeemsReel Injun: On the Trail of the Hollywood Indian, Dir.

																	This course is about the demarcation, blurring, and erasure of cultural borders in literature. In the texts we read, cross-cultural encounters resound in different historical, linguistic and literary registers. The texts at once dramatize and participate in identity formations during a variety of periods, including colonial Mexico and interwar Poland. We examine principles of “translation” and the reciprocal relationship between language and culture. What are the special capabilities and limitations of literature in meaning transfer across cultures? How do we interpret and communicate the selective permeability of transcultural encounters? How do these texts challenge or complicate our own understanding of cultural exchange?As part of the University’s R&C sequence, this course is designed, above all, to help students improve their critical writing and reading skills. In addition to regular attendance, reading, and participation, requirements include a series of essays—drafts and revisions—and short response papers.We don't know why you're here, and we have nothing to offer you at this particular page.

																	“Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ …”-Shakespeare, OthelloPhilip Sidney called his canonical Defense of Poesy an “ink-wasting toy”; Shakespeare felled a hero with a handkerchief; Melville sent a ship on a wild whale chase. In this course, we’ll ask what trifles, toys, trash, and other distractions are doing in some otherwise serious (and some not-so-serious) novels, poems, plays, and treatises.How do we come to judge objects as undeserving of our attention in the first place? One of our aims will be to re-examine insignificance, indifference, and inconsequentiality as critically productive means of analyzing literary and social hierarchies. We’ll consider what happens when sleuths meet red herrings, poets get intimate with insects, a lock of hair ruins everything, and nothing comes of nothing. We’ll ask what makes a trifle more than just a trifle, and inquire after some of the effects an attention to irrelevance can have on form and style: exhaustive description, microscopic close-ups, inappropriate interruptions, and harrowingly close analysis.This is a writing-intensive course. As we sift through the rubbish heaps of our observations and our own throwaway comments, we’ll work to hone our close-reading skills and to craft clear, compelling, and relevant arguments about how texts work.Required Texts:The following required books will be available for purchase at the University Press Books.

																	A Mini-Course and Residency with Christopher Bollas at the Townsend Center for the HumanitiesThe seminar and residency will explore the work of the most influential psychoanalyst writing in English today, Christopher Bollas, who will be scholar-in-residence at the Townsend Center in the first week of November 2016. Bollas is widely known for his pioneering, polymathic, and maverick investigations of unconscious perception of objects and the object world, including human beings—work that has been highly suggestive for many domains of the humanities and social sciences—and more recently for his exploration of fractured unconsciousness (anxiety, hysteria, breakdown, and schizophrenia). Prior to Bollas’s visit, we will discuss his published works (including The Freudian Moment, The Shadow of the Object, Being a Character, and When the Sun Bursts: The Enigma of Schizophrenia) as well as forthcoming and in-progress work that he will provide. Students will present their own projects to the group, and will develop questions to be tabled for seminars with Bollas himself and for one-on-one meetings with him during his residency.Professor Whitney Davis (History of Art) convenes the three seminar sessions, which meet on Wednesday, September 21 and October 5, and Tuesday, October 18, all from 5:15 pm – 7 pm.  Participants must attend all three sessions, participate in one-on-one meetings with Bollas, and attend the associated public events of his residency that take place daily from October 31 through November 4.The seminar is open to graduate students in any program, for 1-unit credit. Students can register for the course by enrolling in Rhetoric 244A, History of Art 298, or Comparative Literature 298.

																	When we say that a work of literature is a “classic,” we mean that it has a special status in a culture: it is widely recognized as excellent or important, and its power to interest and delight is proven and expected to endure. In this course we will read and discuss classic works of literature of different periods, cultures, and genres (short stories, novellas, plays, and poems) with an eye toward explaining why they have this status.This course fulfills the first half of the Reading and Composition (R&C) requirement.

																	Some say that the TV series has recently supplanted the novel as America’s great art form, echoing the critic Brett Martin’s claim that the TV series has become, “the signature American art form of the first decade of the 21st century” in his book Difficult Men. But this idea of a series or sequential work of art can be traced back much earlier than the 21st century. This class will examine the idea of the series and the broader concept of seriality from a wide range of national cultures and genres (poetry, prose, radio, TV, as well as visual works of art and graphic novels) in an attempt to better understand and analyze this popular art form.  How do we analyze a serial work of art?  What challenges and questions does a longer sequence bring to the practice of close reading and analysis?  How does our approach to reading a series change from genre to genre?  How do authors use anticipation to construct their narratives?  We’ll approach these questions over the course of the semester, while honing the critical thinking and writing skills necessary to articulate our answers to them.This is a writing-intensive course, with an emphasis on critical thinking and the process of revision.  Students will be asked to complete short writing assignments as well as formal analytical essays and one research assignment.  Students will also be asked to develop their own series as a creative counterpoint to the analytic writing skills developed in this course.Required books/ podcastsThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conrad Doyle

																	In this course we pull out the guts of stories to try and understand how storytellers craft works that grip us. In the process we examine classic attempts to say what makes good storytelling and put to the test the idea that any story has certain “rules” that make it successful. We will analyze films, screenplays, novels and drama. One segment of the course will examine episodic story structure in the forms of epic and a season of television.Our study of films will incorporate in-depth analysis of shooting scripts—some rare, which we obtain for exclusive use directly from the film writer, production company or the WGA library.TextsHomer, Iliad

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, right?Comparative Literature Professor Dora Zhang gives us a brief overview excerpted from her presentation at the November 29 symposium on the subject.The origins of free indirect discourse are disputed. Cases in classical and medieval literature have been proposed but they are usually subject to debate. The history of the style, however, seems to gain greater clarity as it goes on. A number of critics cite La Fontaine’s Fables as an early example of the style (sometimes along with Pascal and Fanny Burney), while Goethe and especially Jane Austen are widely credited with developing it into a full-fledged form and using it in sustained fashion. What is indisputable is that by the mid-19th century, free indirect style had become a well-established technique in a number of European literatures. Associated perhaps with no writer more than Flaubert, its use explodes after him, and by the early decades of the twentieth century, one would be hard pressed to find a novel that is free of free indirect discourse. Those odd sentences blending features of direct and indirect discourse, blurring the boundaries between narrator and character, can be found in Henry James, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, Zora Neale Hurston, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, Marcel Proust and André Gide, to name just a few examples.The early twentieth century is also the moment when this style becomes consolidated as a critical term of art (1).   The English term “free indirect style” comes from style indirect libre, coined in 1912 by the Swiss linguist Charles Bally, who was a student of Saussure’s. It’s a somewhat infelicitous translation, since the “libre” referred to the syntactic independence of such sentences, the fact that they don’t have to be embedded. A number of other alternatives have been proposed, including Dorrit Cohn’s “narrated monologue” and, to my mind, the clearest description of what the style does, Ann Banfield’s term, “represented speech and thought,” which she expands to include “represented perception”(2).   Nevertheless, despite its infelicities, the terminological battle is long over and the term “free indirect style” or “free indirect discourse” seems here to stay.Why does the style become so widespread in modernism? One reason surely has to do with the increasing emphasis on focalization and narrative point of view. As the omniscient narrator disappears and presenting the narrative from the perspective of a character becomes more prominent, free indirect discourse becomes an elegant way to represent a character’s thoughts, speech, and perceptions directly without the intervention of a narrator who reports these. It also does double-duty. Once the facts of the narrative are presented through the  perspective of a particular character, we’re learning something about not only the world that is being perceived, but also the subject who is perceiving it. So to describe how Kate Croy seems to Milly Theale in The Wings of the Dove, for instance, tells us something not only about Kate but also about Milly. This in turn allows for greater concision, which was good for writers, like Henry James, who were always worried about staying within magazines’ word limits.Such double-sided perceptions also create epistemological affordances. Virginia Woolf, one of the most adept and systematic practitioners of free indirect style, was especially interested in the play of perspectives that opens up once narration is liberated from the tyranny of the first person. By meticulously presenting the setting of the story and its events through the represented thoughts, speech, and perceptions of particular characters, her novelistic universe is intricately built up by piecing together the fragments that we get – sometimes very brief, sometimes quite extended – from each individual’s perspective.Free indirect style is often understood as a blending together of the subjective and the objective, thus it creates what D. A. Miller calls in Jane Austen, or the Secret of Style, “the paradoxical form of an impersonal intimacy”(3).  Does it allow for characters to be represented more fully in their subjectivity and alterity? Or does it instead, as Miller proposes in The Novel and the Police, reinforce the control of the narrator’s “master-voice,” infecting characters’ thoughts and speech with its own language, becoming a kind of “novelistic Panopticon”?(4).  Without resolving the question about the politics of free indirect style, let’s look at this passage, which comes from the Nausicaa episode of Joyce’s Ulysses, when Gerty McDowell, a young girl, observes Leopold Bloom looking at her on the Sandymount Strand beach. “Yes it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul”(5). Although the thoughts represented here are Gerty’s, the language comes not from her or from a narrator, but from outside the work altogether, the domain of sentimental fiction that Joyce is parodying in this episode. As Franco Moretti argues about a similar use of free indirect style in Madame Bovary, when Emma marvels at having a lover and becoming like the heroines of the romantic novels she read as a girl, the words are neither the character’s nor the narrator’s, but “commonplaces, collective myths, signs of the social that is inside her”(6).  For Moretti, this is a sign that in the bourgeois France of Flaubert, “character and narrator have lost their distinctiveness, subsumed by the composite discourse of bourgeois doxa”(7).  Can the same be said of Joyce? Whether we agree with Moretti’s argument or not, what moments like these show is that even as free indirect style can convey characters’ thoughts intimately, it can also show that our language is not always, not only (not ever?) our own.__________________________(1)  There are early discussions of it in the 1880s by Alfred Tobler, but the first critics to discuss it in a sustained way (most of them philologists or linguists) are overwhelmingly doing so in the 1910s and 1920s – Charles Bally, Otto Jespersen, Marguerite Lips, Etienne Lorck (a philologist and Romanist whose was the teacher of Leo Spitzer), and Gertraud Lerch, whose term “Uneigentliche direkte Rede” is adopted by the Russian Marxist linguist Valentin Voloshinov.(2)  See Dorrit Cohn, Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), and Ann Banfield, Unspeakable Sentences: Narration and Representation in the Language of Fiction (Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1982).(3) D.

No application submitted later than December 4 will be considered for the 2018-19 academic year.The Department of Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley, offers opportunities for graduate study in a wide variety of literary traditions, with emphasis on historical coverage, on issues of influence and reception, and on critical and theoretical approaches ranging from textual criticism to cultural studies. Comparative Literature faculty hold joint appointments with many different language and literature departments on the campus, and Comparative Literature graduate students enroll in a diverse selection of classes offered by those departments, in addition to Comparative Literature seminars.Because of the size and diversity of its faculty, the importance of its general library, its several special collections, and its other research facilities, Berkeley offers superior opportunities for graduate study in nearly all areas of Comparative Literature. Specifically, the Department of Comparative Literature offers organized programs leading to specialization in all areas of Western literature from the earliest Mediterranean texts to the twentieth century, as well as in major areas of East-West, Latin American and African studies, and it is equipped to devise individual degree programs in some special areas in which regular course instruction is not normally listed. The fact that graduates of this Department are currently teaching at the university level such widely different literatures as English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, Italian, Russian, Greek, Sanskrit, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic, along with film, gender, and ethnic studies, illustrates the wealth of choices facing entering students.Previously, the Department required Ph.D. students first to obtain an M.A. before proceeding in the Ph.D. program. There is no longer an M.A. requirement, and the procedure of the second year review is in place. All students in the program are admitted directly to the Ph.D., and cannot apply to a terminal master’s program. Please see Section 2 below for more information about the second year review and M.A. degree.The Ph.D. program is designed to provide familiarity with one literature in comprehensive historical and critical ways and the demonstrated ability to do comparative work in three literatures. The Ph.D. is awarded upon the successful completion of a doctoral dissertation.The Ph.D. program requires:1. A minimum of 10 courses taken at Berkeley distributed as follows:
* Comparative Literature 200
* Three additional graduate courses in the Department of Comparative Literature
* Four graduate courses in the major literature
* One graduate course in each of the two minor literaturesStudents admitted from graduate programs elsewhere will have their courses evaluated by an advisor. A maximum of two earlier courses may be approved by the Head Graduate Advisor for credit towards the ten course requirement and “coverage.”2. Completion of the second year review. No later than the fourth semester, students meet with a committee of three faculty members to review progress toward the degree and plan the remaining work required for the Ph.D. For those students who wish to continue in the Ph.D. program with a formal master’s title, a master’s examination is required at this time.
3. Historical coverage in the major literature as demonstrated by coursework or inclusion of items on the Ph.D. reading list.
4. Knowledge of at least three foreign languages other than English.
5. A Qualifying Examination for which the student prepares reading lists for one major literature and two minor literatures and indicates an area of focus via a statement of interest. The examination consists of both a written and an oral portion.
6. A doctoral dissertation based on a prospectus presented the semester following successful completion of the Qualifying Examination.The U.C. Berkeley Graduate Division has established a “normative time” of seven years for completion of the Ph.D. degree in Comparative Literature. Following is a recommended timetable:* Second year review (and, if applicable, M.A. examination) completed by end of fourth semester
* Ph.D. coursework and Qualifying Examination completed by the end of the eighth semester
* Dissertation completed by the end of the fourteenth semesterWhile students are urged to stay within this timetable, the department also recognizes that there are legitimate reasons for deviating from it. Students are required to review their progress with their advisors during the enrollment period each semester, as progress toward the degree is an important factor weighed by the department when making fellowship evaluations and hiring Graduate Student Instructors.We try to fund as many students as possible with fellowship/teaching packages through campus-wide and departmental funding sources. All applicants should be aware of the Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) fellowship, which can be applied for directly on the online graduate application. In addition, we encourage applicants  to explore outside funding opportunities such as the Mellon programs, as well as other funding sources that may be found on the internet. All students who are accepted to the program will be told, in their admission letters, all relevant details of the funding support being offered to them.The Office of Financial Aid (201 Sproul Hall) provides information on Federally Insured Student Loans, University Loans, and Emergency Loans, as well as on Grants-in-Aid, the National Direct Student Loan Program, College Work-Study and Educational Fee Deferments.Teaching appointments provide a significant component of the financial support available to graduate students who are making good progress toward their degrees. Comparative Literature employs continuing graduate students, i.e. those who have completed at least one year in the program (although occasionally students may be offered teaching positions in their first year), as Graduate Student Instructors to teach undergraduate reading and composition courses. Students may also find employment in other language and literature departments on the Berkeley campus. Research assistantships and reader positions may also be available in Comparative Literature and other departments.2017Ashley Brock has accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Romance Languages at the University of Pennsylvania.Katie Kadue will be in the Society of Fellows at the University of Chicago.  Julia K.

Not surprisingly, then, students considering a major in this department often have diverse conceptions of the kind of study they are embarking upon. Indeed, comparative literature is a complex discipline in large part because of the diversity of interests of the people engaged in it. As a major in the department, you will be asked to do a number of different things which reflect the complexities behind the concept of Comparative Literature.1. You will be asked to familiarize yourself with literature from at least two different national traditions, studied in their original languages. In its most obvious sense, Comparative Literature might be seen to start here. By studying different literary traditions, you will begin to be able to imagine what might constitute differences or similarities between those literatures.2. You will be asked to think about literature not only from differing national traditions, but from widely separated historical periods as well. Thus Comparative Literature might also involve imagining what historical differences in the conception of literature teach us about its own nature or its function.3. You will be asked to think about what the verb compare means when applied to a specific group of authors or texts from different literatures (Comparative Literature 190). What do you compare when you compare authors, or literature, or specific works of literature? What theoretical problems do various acts of comparison raise?4. You will be asked to think theoretically about the idea of literature itself, about, for example, some of the following questions. How and why is literature divided into different genres or different periods? How is literature situated within a given society? How is literature different from other domains such as philosophy or psychoanalysis or politics? Students interested in literary theory will find much in the study of comparative literature to interest them, for example the challenge of confronting Western literary theory with previously unexplored non-Western literatures. Why Comparative Literature?One of the advantages of a major in such a field as Comparative Literature, formed out of a variety of different concerns about literature, is that it allows a student, within a set of general requirements, to follow a program of study which contains a great deal of freedom, a program which can be greatly shaped by the student’s own interests. If you are interested in relations between various literatures, in literatures not often studied or not studied in conjunction, in literature studied in relation to philosophy or politics or the other arts or other disciplines, or in the relationship between film and literature, you may be able to design a program within the Department of Comparative Literature which will help you to pursue your interests.If you are thinking of continuing your education in a professional school of some sort, a Comparative Literature major can both give you an excellent general education in the humanities and leave you the flexibility to pursue your other fields of interests — in the Sciences or Social Sciences, for example. Majors in Comparative Literature at Berkeley usually experience no difficulty in preparing themselves for graduate study in Law, Business, Librarianship, and other professional curricula.A Comparative Literature major is also excellent preparation for an academic career. Graduates from the Department of Comparative Literature at Berkeley currently teach English, Latin, and modern foreign languages at the the high school level. Comparative Literature majors are also well prepared for graduate study and research in both Comparative Literature and the literatures in which they have specialized. Holders of graduate degrees in Comparative Literature teach in Departments of English, Classics, Modern Foreign Languages, Near Eastern Studies, Oriental Studies, and Comparative Literature at various colleges and universities.Who May Major in Comparative Literature?Anyone who is interested in literature and has the linguistic aptitude to pursue the study of a foreign language beyond the sophomore level may major in Comparative Literature at Berkeley. The major program is especially suitable for those students who have the preparation necessary to undertake junior or senior work in more than one department of instruction.How to Major in Comparative Literature:If you are thinking of majoring in Comparative Literature, you should meet with a departmental major adviser at your earliest opportunity, and tentatively map out a program for yourself within the major. You will probably discover that the requirements are flexible enough to suit you, and may find it to your advantage to ask the departmental adviser to suggest relevant freshman and sophomore courses.Majors must see the Student Affairs Officer or a faculty adviser each semester to plan a program for the coming year.  Before calling upon your adviser, please familiarize yourself with the basic requirements listed below. Keep in mind that most of these requirements must be interpreted according to literatures in which you plan to work and your own long-range plans: you are strongly advised to read everything in this pamphlet before deciding what requirements apply to you and what course of study seems most suitable to your aims and aptitudes. Major Requirements in Various Literatures:1. Only one of the various series of major field requirements (see Checklist of Requirements) applies to you; keep in mind that it refers to the literature which you have chosen as a major field within your program in Comparative Literature and in which you must complete at least 3 or more upper-division courses in the original language (as of Fall 2017). The minor field in Comparative Literature consists of 2 upper-division literature courses of your choosing, in the original language.2. Although all reading in courses in foreign literatures which you count in satisfaction of major and minor requirements must be done in the original language, you may wish to select courses where the lectures are given in English rather than in the foreign language. Since the entries in the General Catalog are not always clear in this respect, you are advised to inquire from individual instructors.3. Whereas each year Berkeley offers instruction in all the relevant areas of the literatures most frequently elected as major fields of Comparative Literature (e.g., English, French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, etc.), the same thing is not always true of the literatures less commonly studied. If the General Catalog shows that only one or two professors offer instruction in the literature which you plan to emphasize within your program in Comparative Literature, you should consult the appropriate professor or professors to ascertain that enough courses or tutorial instruction will be available to ensure your graduation at the end of your senior year. In some cases, you may have to enroll in a graduate course to satisfy a requirement for which no upper-division course or tutorial instruction is available during a given year: make sure that the instructor will admit you, and remember that graduate courses demand more work and intellectual commitment than their undergraduate counterparts.4. With the permission of your adviser and the appropriate instructor, you may occasionally be allowed to substitute a graduate course for an upper-division course. With your adviser’s permission, a lower-division course may occasionally be accepted in satisfaction of a specific requirement, but it may never count in satisfaction of any of the 32 upper-division units required in literature.5. Some departments find it convenient to grant upper-division credit for elementary or intermediate language courses: unless otherwise indicated below, these courses may not be counted as part of the minimum 4 upper-division courses required in your major literature.Special Studies Courses: H195, 199In accordance with a rule of the Academic Senate, a student who wishes to pursue an individual study project under these course numbers should submit a detailed proposal including the purpose of the course, a description of the subject and method, and a reading list to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. To enroll in H195, complete and submit the Honors Prospectus Form. A decision will then be made whether to allow the student to take the course. Each proposal will be evaluated on its intellectual and educational merits. Projects which could be carried out within the framework of regularly scheduled courses will not be approved for special-studies courses. The student should discuss the feasibility of his project with the proposed course director before submitting it for approval.  The basic requirements are the same as those listed above for the regular program, with the additions listed as follows:1. At least a 3.55 general grade point average and a 3.65 grade point average in the major for admission to the Honors Program in the junior or senior year.2. A grade of B or higher in Comparative Literature H195 for the writing of an Honors Thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty. Honors students must prepare an Honor’s Thesis through enrollment in one or two semesters of Comparative Literature H195.
Award of HonorsThe award of Honors in Comparative Literature at Berkeley is not automatic. Completion of the requirements listed above merely guarantees eligibility. The final recommendation is made by the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Comparative Literature after evaluation of the honors thesis and the candidate’s total performance in literature.
Strongly RecommendedHonors students who plan to take up graduate study in Comparative Literature or a single literature are urged to begin the study of a third foreign language relevant to their proposed field of graduate study. You should consult your adviser in this respect, and look up the graduate requirements.Below are:A.  a 4 year plan;B.  2 year plan for 3rd year transfer students;C.  and a comparison of major and minor requirements (with the minor requirements in the  lower right of the document).  For more details, contact the Comp Lit undergrad adviser at complituga@berkeley.edu.The following is a condensation of both major and minor programs in Comparative Literature; the minor (5 courses) is shown in the lower right.   For those considering study abroad…Many Comparative Literature students study abroad. We actively encourage this experience. International study can be enlightening and fulfilling, both personally and academically. Although study abroad requires some planning ahead, we believe the benefits are well worth the effort for most students.Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA) is a University of California, system-wide program. Located in 160 Stephens Hall, BSA is the office on campus that administers education abroad for Berkeley students, and there are BSA Advisers ready to assist you in planning your overseas program. One of the advantages of this program is that the courses you take transfer straight to your Berkeley transcript, and grades you receive on BSA are calculated into your UC GPA. Moreover, you pay Berkeley fees and continue to be eligible for most financial aid. Special need-based BSA scholarships are available.Non-BSA Programs: The Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers some help to students who want to participate in non-BSA programs. The office at 110 Sproul provides advising during scheduled “drop-in” hours and has some brochures, but much of the reference material (even on non-BSA programs) is kept in the BSA library in Stephens Hall.The Department of Comparative Literature will expect you to make normal degree progress and will review your standing before approving a semester or year abroad. The courses taken abroad that we accept must be equivalent to those offered at Berkeley. The student is responsible for bringing back official transcripts, course descriptions, and reading lists that will aid Comparative Literature advisors in evaluating acceptable coursework. It goes without saying that conversation or “culture” courses cannot be applied toward the requirements for the undergraduate major. The college of Letters and Science will decide the total unit credit the student receives.Effective Fall 2017, the program requirements will change accordingly, pending final approval from campus:French will be one course each in:Italian will be one course each in:Japanese:  Two courses from 155, 159, and premodern language.  The third could be an additional course from that category in literature (or film) in translation (survey, or Japanese film 160, 185, or 188).Chinese will be one course each in:Russian/Slavic will be any three courses from the time span of 1800 to the present.  One of the 180 series of undergraduate courses taught in Russian can be taken as a means of fulfilling this requirement.  Film may be taken in addition but not as a substitute for one of the three courses.  Examples:   133, 134C, 134D, 138.English:German:Hebrew – one each from the following:Spanish:Track 1:  Latin AmericaTrack 2:  Spanish and Latin America (choose 3 of the 4 below)    Track 3:  Peninsular SpainThe department expects that the three courses have a literary focus._________________________________________________________A minimum of TEN upper division classes (35-40 units) are required and must include courses from the following:COMPARATIVE LITERATURE: Three upper division courses required.* CL 100: Introduction to Comparative Literature

Achieve solid proficiency in at least one language other than English, to the level needed to work with original texts in at least two national literary traditionsb. Attain a solid grounding in at least two national literary traditions, one of which is considered the student’s major literaturec. Understand key characteristics of historical periods in the major literatured. Achieve knowledge of one relevant classical literaturee. Recognize and understand the workings of genre in literature (novel, poetic form, epic, drama)f. Achieve fluency in the use of major critical and theoretical modes of analysisg. Situate literary movements in their relation to historical and cultural contextsh. Analyze aspects of literature that can or must be studied cross-culturally (such as translation, avant-garde movements, romanticism, modernism, diasporic literatures) II. Skillsa) critical readingStudents develop the capacity to:i. perform a strong and revealing close analysis of a textii. recognize the literary and rhetorical features that structure texts and shape their reception;iii. employ the conceptual tools and insights of literary theoretical texts in reading and interpreting texts drawn from various literary genres, literary criticism, historical materials, and literary theory itself;iv. present accurately the arguments of a literary critic or theorist, uncovering unarticulated assumptions to illuminate the context in which the argument is made;v. understand the implications of different interpretive approaches, considering the benefits and limitations of different strategies.b) argumentationStudents learn to:i. develop a line of questioning that leads to the construction of a logical, well-supported argument;ii. evaluate their own arguments and those of others on the criteria of logical coherence, good use of evidence and comprehensiveness;iii. respond to new evidence or new perspectives on the evidence by refining or revising their argument.c) oral and written expression Students learn toi. present complex information and ideas orally, both in a prepared presentation and spontaneously;ii. participate in a discussion with multiple participants by asking questions, listening closely to others, building upon their contributions, and formulating productive and relevant responses;iii. write formal expository prose that is clear, persuasive, and economical;iv. revise their own writing to improve its clarity and effectiveness.d) researchStudents learn toi. formulate a productive research question that has a rigorous conceptual framework and makes good use of the available evidence;ii. use databases, indices and other tools to identify and locate relevant materials;iii. assess the relevance and reliability of available materials;iv.  cite published work properly.III.  Path to GoalsWe offer the following sequence of required courses:a. Entry to the majorMany students enter the major after taking English Composition in Connection with the Reading of World Literature (R1A-R1B), which is a basic skills course that focuses intensively on developing students’ ability to read and interpret literature, to recognize the components of a successful argument and to revise their own writing for maximum effectiveness.b. Introductory courseIntroduction to Comparative Literature (CL 100) forms a bridge between lower-division reading and composition classes and the more sophisticated work students will be doing at the higher levels by offering a focused introduction to one aspect of Comparative Literature, e.g. a specific school of critical thought, a test-case of cross-cultural literary interaction, an exploration of a theme across genres.  Students in this class are challenged to write longer and more complex papers, to read and critique scholarly arguments, and to give oral presentations.c. Coverage of historical periodsStudents are required to gain further grounding in the relation between literature and its historical context by taking one of the following courses: The Ancient Mediterranean World (CL 151); The Middle Ages (CL 152); The Renaissance (CL 153); Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Literature (CL 154); The Modern Period (155).  These courses further develop the training begun in CL 100, but also deepen the students’ understanding of specific historical periods and of conceptual approaches to the historical study of literature.d. Classical literatureStudents are required to take a course in a classical literature relevant to their program (Greek, Latin, Biblical Hebrew, classical Arabic, classical Chinese, classical Japanese, Arabic)e. ElectivesIn addition to these required courses, we offer electives that expand the range of opportunities students have to study literature comparatively, e.g., The Biblical Tradition in Western Literature (CL 120) and Gender , Sexuality, and Culture (CL 185).  The individual attention that students receive as they craft their own plan  of study  has always been one of the major’s strengths.  Close relationships with faculty within the major and detailed review of the plan of study with the undergraduate advisor allow students to draw upon the full strengths of the national literature departments and the comparative literature faculty.f. Courses within the national literature departmentsStudents are required to take six courses within the national literature departments (four in the major literature, two in the minor). Our undergraduate advisor and student affairs officer spend hours each semester culling and approving appropriate courses.  Study abroad is also encouraged, particularly in collaboration with UC’s Education Abroad Program. Courses taken abroad must be approved by the undergraduate advisor.g. Capstone CourseThe senior seminar (CL 190) is designed to be the culmination of the major; students are required to analyze works from at least three literary traditions and to write a substantial research paper.  Topics for this course vary and emphasize different aspects of the discipline. Recent courses have included “Philosophical Fictions,” “James Joyce’s Ulysses and Its Heirs,” “Writing and Photography,” and “National Narratives.”Students may complete an optional honors thesis under the guidance of a faculty member from any department. III. Communication with StudentsThe requirements and courses are communicated via the departmental website and by consultation with the undergraduate student affairs office and faculty. Since no two students follow the same course of study, each individual student receives regular and intensive in-person advising from the student affairs officer as well as the faculty. IV. Evaluation of the attainment of our goalsComparative Literature edited video:Comparative Literature unedited version:
