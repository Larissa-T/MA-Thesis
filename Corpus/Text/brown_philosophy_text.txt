						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownBrown University Ph. D. program in Philosophy is designed to provide strong support for students’ research. After devoting two years to coursework, students begin their research in the third year by conducting literature reviews under the supervision of faculty members, and by enrolling in a seminar that is intended to promote work aimed at publication. These special courses help students to identify dissertation topics. Dissertation work begins in earnest in the fourth year. In that year and in succeeding years, students enroll every semester in a special seminar, the dissertation workshop, in which they present their research and receive feedback from faculty and peers. During this time they also work closely with dissertation advisers other members of their dissertation committees.Financial support is guaranteed for the first five years of study, and also for the first four summers. It is not guaranteed for the sixth year, but in almost all cases thus far, applications for sixth year support have been successful. In the first year, students focus exclusively on course work. Teaching responsibilities begin in the second year, continue through the fourth year, and return in the sixth year. In the fifth year, however, students set teaching aside so they can concentrate on dissertation research. In this year, they may, if they like, spend periods of time at other universities, interacting with faculty and students who share their interests. Teaching responsibilities generally take the form of work as assistants in courses run by faculty, but in the fourth and sixth years, students may apply to be teaching fellows, in which case they have full responsibility for undergraduate courses. There are also opportunities for summer teaching.The Department has several endowed funds, designed to support the development of graduate students and generally to improve the intellectual environment of the graduate program. The Graduate Professional Development Fund is used exclusively to promote graduate scholarship. Among other things, it provides support for giving talks at conferences and for travel to take courses at other institutions. The Mark Shapiro Fund supports an annual conference that is run entirely by graduate students. This fund also supports a bi-annual academic conference in a specific topic and a lecture series. The Royce Lectureship Fund supports a prestigious lecture series in philosophy of mind, and our department sponsors a further lecture series in collaboration with Blackwell Publishing. Finally, the Chisholm Fund currently supports a bi-annual Distinguished Visitor series, which brings to our department a distinguished philosopher for one semester. The department is also home to independently funded academic programs that sponsor multiple activities, such as lectures, workshops, and conferences in specific areas of philosophy, including the Program for Ethical Inquiry and the Political Philosophy Workshop. In addition to these departmental funds, the Brown Graduate School also makes substantial awards in support of travel by graduate students. Moreover, the Open Masters Program allows students to apply to pursue an MA degree in another discipline while pursuing a Ph. D. in Philosophy. Students admitted in this program automatically receive an additional year of financial support to complete their MA degree. Students may also apply for extra support from the University’s Cogut Humanities Center. Finally, they can receive substantial assistance with teaching at the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning.   Apply OnlineThe Department offers admission in the fall only for its Ph.D. program. (Please note that there is no separate M.A. program in philosophy.1) Application may be made online. Applicants must submit official transcripts, three letters of recommendation, official GRE scores (no advanced subject test is required), and a sample of philosophical writing. The application deadline is 2 January.The preliminary requirements for the Ph.D. are satisfied by demonstrating competence in logic, philosophy of science, language, and mind, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, and history of philosophy. This may be done either by passing prescribed courses with a quality grade or through satisfactory completion of an individually tailored major-minors program, planned in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies and submitted to the department for approval.Within seven semesters of full-time or equivalent residency at Brown, the student must gain admission to Ph.D. candidacy. Admission to candidacy is granted after satisfaction of the preliminary evaluation and distribution requirements and upon approval of a dissertation prospectus by a dissertation committee. An oral defense of the dissertation is required once it is completed.Information about graduate studies in philosophy at Brown University is available in the department's Graduate Student Handbook.Inquiries regarding graduate admissions should be directed to the Graduate School and not to the Director of Graduate Studies. The Director of Graduate Studies is responsible only for the Graduate Program, and plays no role in the admissions process.1This is not to say that the department does not offer a Master of Arts degree. Any student who has completed the preliminary requirements for the Ph.D. is eligible to be awarded an M.A. It is sometimes taken as a terminal degree by those who decide, for whatever reason, not to complete the Ph.D., but who have completed the preliminary requirements. And it is sometimes taken as a non-terminal degree by students who do intend to complete the Ph.D. but who would just like to receive it. The degree may also be awarded to Brown undergraduates admitted to the A.B./A.M. program. Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe undergraduate concentration in philosophy offers courses covering all of the main areas of the discipline, from epistemology and metaphysics to philosophy of religion, philosophy of literature, and feminist philosophy. It also offers courses covering all the various periods in the  history of philosophy. Concentrators can expect to strengthen their  knowledge of and skills in ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy,  logic, epistemology, metaphysics and philosophy of value. While the concentration provides a strong general education in philosophy, concentrators are required to identify  an area of specialization.Students with questions about the concentration should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Justin Broackes.Students in philosophy will:New concentration requirements became effective in January 2013.  Students who declared their concentration prior to that date are still  subject to the old requirements, which can be found in the University Bulletin.The current requirement is ten courses total of which no more than  one may be below Phil 0350, and at least three of which must be at or  above Phil 0990.Each philosophy concentrator must take:Students are asked to choose a "specialization", consisting of three  related courses from a single area of philosophy, for example: logic and  language; philosophy of science; epistemology; philosophy of mind; moral  philosophy; political philosophy; ancient philosophy; and so forth. At  most one course from the specialization can also be counted for one of  the five area requirements.Concentrators who aim at a general acquaintance with the discipline of philosophy may forgo a specialization and devise an appropriately balanced program of courses beyond the requirements with the approval of the DUS (Director of Undergraduate Studies).No more than one course may fulfill both a general distribution requirement and a specialization requirement.No more than two courses from departments other than the philosophy department may be counted among the ten courses required for the concentration; no more than one of these two outside courses may count towards the three specialization requirements. The specialization and the courses that will fulfill it are standardly declared at some point in the course of the Junior year.  Those making a Concentration Declaration at an earlier time (e.g. at the end of their Sophomore year) may make a provisional choice of courses which can be revised at a later date with the approval of the department's DUS (Director of Undergraduate Studies).Each philosophy concentrator must complete a "capstone". For more information, see the page on the senior year.Philosophy concentrators have the option of writing an Honor's Thesis,  which is typically researched and written over the course of the entire  senior year. Interested students should consult with the concentration  advisor during the sixth semester concerning procedures and  requirements.  Philosophy GPA must be greater than 3.5.  (This refers to the GPA at the beginning of the senior year in all philosophy courses, and including at least six courses.)This page describes the "standard" concentration in Philosophy. There is  also a related but separate concentration in Physics and Philosophy.  More information on that program is available from  the Physics department and from  the Registrar's office.Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThere are several options for a 'Capstone Experience' in philosophy.Seniors wishing to earn honors by presenting a senior honors thesis should consult their concentration advisor during their sixth semester or at the start of the seventh semester, concerning procedures and requirements. In addition to completing the usual nonhonors requirements, a student must write a thesis judged to be of honors quality by two readers and have a grade point average of over 3.5 in philosophy courses.  (The GPA at the beginning of the senior year must be greater than 3.5, including at least six courses, of which at least five must be taken for a letter grade; and the GPA must be at least 3.5 at the end of the Senior year.) Honors theses are usually prepared over two semesters' work with an advisor. There is more information on writing an honors thesis on this page.Many professors will be happy to set up a Phil 1990 reading course for one semester with an individual student, e.g. leading to the preparation of a special large paper on a particular topic of research. One option is to set up a Reading Course to accompany a 1000-level course that you have recently taken or are taking at the same time. For example, you might take Phil 1660 Metaphysics, and also do a special reading course on Necessity or on Reduction and Supervenience. Or you might take Phil 1640, The Nature of Morality, and also do a reading course to specialize in the notion of Moral Facts. In each case the 1000-level course would provide a general overview of the topic and give you an idea of one professor's views, and then you could research further in the subject either with that same professor or with another with overlapping interests. A one-semester Reading Course may also for some people be a first step towards writing an Honors Thesis.There are seminars in the Phil 0990 series, aimed primarily at advanced undergraduates, on varying topics each year.2000-level seminars are mainly aimed at graduate students, but many are able to take advanced undergraduates as well. The best preparation is usually to have done a 1000-level course with the same professor or in the same general area of philosophy.Please feel free to talk to the Concentration Advisors about ideas and questions you might have about any of these options or to approach in office hours individual professors who might be able to help you as an advisor for a particular project.Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThere is no requirement for people concentrating in Philosophy to write an Undergraduate Honors Thesis; some people do so, many people don't.To write a thesis, you need a topic and an Advisor and a suitable amount of time. There is no single model to follow, but one standard approach is this. You'd work on the thesis during the two semesters of your Senior Year. In the first semester, you might work through a reading program with the advice of your Advisor, meeting with her or him three or four times in the semester and writing two or three pieces of work—for example, discussions of existing publications in the field and sketches of your own responses to them. Over the break you'd pull together a plan for the thesis itself. In the second semester, you'd write a first draft of the thesis and then a final draft—expecting, of course, that you would continue to do some new reading, and that you might need to be flexible with your original plan. The thesis itself is due about April 15th (or more exactly, two weeks before the Friday on which the Reading Period begins).It is possible in principle to choose a topic which you don't know much about in advance; but typically the result of that is that you have to spend a larger amount of time reaching base camp, so to speak—getting a decent grasp of existing approaches to the topic—and you have less time for heading up to the summit—developing ideas of your own. Many of the best theses come when a student has already got some idea of a problem area, e.g. from a 1000 level course that might have spent a week or two on the detailed topic in question, and might have introduced the class to materials and methods used in related areas that might constitute a useful tool-kit for this topic too. If you already know a bit about the existing approaches to the topic, but have a feeling that you're not quite satisfied with any of them, then you're probably in a good position to go deeper into it, researching further proposals from other people and working out a distinctive contribution of your own.When you have a first idea of the area in which you'd like to work, you can approach a potential advisor direct, e.g. by e-mail or in Office Hours, or you can discuss the matter with your Concentration Advisor, who should be able to point you towards Faculty Members with interests in areas close to your proposed topic. Don't let your ideas become too fixed too early: often a good discussion will leave you thinking of unexpected directions you'll want to head off in. The normal time for approaching an Advisor is in the first week of the first semester of your Senior Year (or a few days earlier), or at the end of the last semester of the Junior Year.The standard thing is to register for a reading course, PHIL 1995 Senior Thesis, either for the first semester alone or for both first and second semesters, with the permission of the Advisor in question. (Note that PHIL 1995 takes on a different section number according to who the Advisor is.)You can register for PHIL 1995 just for one semester (followed by registering for either 3 or 4 classes in the other semester). Alternatively, you can register for PHIL 1995 for a second semester. Which you do is a matter for negotiation with your advisor, taking into account, e.g. the number of meetings, and the amount and scope of reading and writing that is done. Obviously the work-load for a Reading course needs to be about the equivalent of a normal course.There's no standard length, but 40–50 pages of carefully-argued material would for many topics be a good target.Two copies of the Thesis are due by the Friday two weeks before the Friday on which the Reading Period begins, which will usually fall close to April 15th. They are to be handed in to the Thesis Advisor. Theses should be computer-printed, on one side only of paper; they do not need to be bound. Some people like to present them in a special folder or binder; this is fine, but not required.There is usually no oral defense of the thesis. The Thesis Advisor will normally be one Reader of the thesis; there will be a second Reader too, appointed by the Concentration Advisor in consultation with the Thesis Advisor.Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Philosophy Department has adopted new designations aiming to identify courses that are either relevant to issues of diversity and inclusion, or focused on them. Courses relevant to issues of diversity and inclusion (designated as RDI) are on problems, theories, or ideas that play an important role in framing any inquiry on the topics of diversity and inclusion. Courses focused on issues of diversity and inclusion (designated as FDI) are on problems, theories, or ideas about diversity and inclusion. In this course, students will investigate the historical and contemporary overlap between philosophy and economics, from the writings of Adam Smith and Karl Marx to recent works in philosophical and economic theory. We will consider the following questions: Are economists committed to a particular theory of ethics or well-being? How should economists and philosophers understand the welfare of individuals? What is the link between free markets and important conceptions of individual freedom? How might moral and political philosophy benefit from economic analysis? How might philosophy inform or enrich economic analysis? Finally, how can economic analysis and philosophy together inform public policy?PHIL 0580 S01Primary InstructorPreiss In the  first part of the course, we will examine Marx's economic, political,  and philosophical writings, focusing on his analysis of capitalism, his  critique of liberal democracy, and his theory of history. Then in the  second part, we will look at some recent attempts to renew and extend  the Marxist tradition. WRITPHIL 0400 S01Primary Instructor  LarmoreG. A. Cohen, who died in 2009, produced one of the most important bodies of work in political philosophy in recent decades. In this graduate seminar, we will study writings spanning the whole of Cohen's career, from his early work in "analytical Marxism" (which he partly invented), through his influential critique of libertarianism (left and right) and of the idea of self-ownership, to finally his criticisms of Rawls' theory of justice and his last, seminal work, Rescuing Justice and Equality (2008). PHIL 2000 S01Primary Instructors  Larmore & EstlundFreedom of speech is a challenging  and controversial ideal. Legal questions are central, but the issues  range into moral and political philosophy as well. We will study John  Stuart Mill's influential 19th century treatment of the idea, and then  concentrate mostly on discussions within the last fifty years, including  much that is on the cutting edge of current thinking about freedom of  speech. Topics will vary, including such things as: political speech,  art and offense, pornography, hate speech, protest, copyright, internet  and new media, and campaign finance laws. WRITPHIL 0550 S01Primary InstructorEstlundIs it unjust that people in some countries have less wealth, worse health, etc., than those in other countries? Does this depend on whether the better off countries partly caused the disparity? Does it depend on whether the worse off are poor, or is it enough that they are relatively worse off? If there are global injustices, what obligations are there, and on whom do they fall, to remedy them? We will study (mostly) recent philosophical work on such questions, including attention to special contexts such as immigration, climate change, poverty, colonialism, secession, intervention, and war.PHIL 0390 SO1Primary InstructorEstlundWe will read some of the recent literature on slurs and hate speech, looking for connections between them. Students not graduate students in philosophy must have had a prior course in philosophy of language.PHIL 2120K S01Primary InstructorHeckThis course uses fiction as a vehicle for philosophical discussions of disability, illness, and death. Topics include the following: What is disability? What is illness? What do healthy people owe sick, disabled, or dying people, and vice versa? Should we fear death? Should we prolong the lives of the terminally ill? Should we support research aimed at greatly extending the human lifespan? How can fiction enrich philosophical discussions of such questions? Readings include novels and short stories as well as writings by philosophers and bioethicists. In order to include students with varied backgrounds, this course is open to all Brown students and has no prerequisites.PHIL 2160F S01Primary InstructorAckerman Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownBrown University Ph. D. program in Philosophy is designed to provide strong support for students’ research. After devoting two years to coursework, students begin their research in the third year by conducting literature reviews under the supervision of faculty members, and by enrolling in a seminar that is intended to promote work aimed at publication. These special courses help students to identify dissertation topics. Dissertation work begins in earnest in the fourth year. In that year and in succeeding years, students enroll every semester in a special seminar, the dissertation workshop, in which they present their research and receive feedback from faculty and peers. During this time they also work closely with dissertation advisers other members of their dissertation committees.Financial support is guaranteed for the first five years of study, and also for the first four summers. It is not guaranteed for the sixth year, but in almost all cases thus far, applications for sixth year support have been successful. In the first year, students focus exclusively on course work. Teaching responsibilities begin in the second year, continue through the fourth year, and return in the sixth year. In the fifth year, however, students set teaching aside so they can concentrate on dissertation research. In this year, they may, if they like, spend periods of time at other universities, interacting with faculty and students who share their interests. Teaching responsibilities generally take the form of work as assistants in courses run by faculty, but in the fourth and sixth years, students may apply to be teaching fellows, in which case they have full responsibility for undergraduate courses. There are also opportunities for summer teaching.The Department has several endowed funds, designed to support the development of graduate students and generally to improve the intellectual environment of the graduate program. The Graduate Professional Development Fund is used exclusively to promote graduate scholarship. Among other things, it provides support for giving talks at conferences and for travel to take courses at other institutions. The Mark Shapiro Fund supports an annual conference that is run entirely by graduate students. This fund also supports a bi-annual academic conference in a specific topic and a lecture series. The Royce Lectureship Fund supports a prestigious lecture series in philosophy of mind, and our department sponsors a further lecture series in collaboration with Blackwell Publishing. Finally, the Chisholm Fund currently supports a bi-annual Distinguished Visitor series, which brings to our department a distinguished philosopher for one semester. The department is also home to independently funded academic programs that sponsor multiple activities, such as lectures, workshops, and conferences in specific areas of philosophy, including the Program for Ethical Inquiry and the Political Philosophy Workshop. In addition to these departmental funds, the Brown Graduate School also makes substantial awards in support of travel by graduate students. Moreover, the Open Masters Program allows students to apply to pursue an MA degree in another discipline while pursuing a Ph. D. in Philosophy. Students admitted in this program automatically receive an additional year of financial support to complete their MA degree. Students may also apply for extra support from the University’s Cogut Humanities Center. Finally, they can receive substantial assistance with teaching at the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning.   Apply OnlineThe Department offers admission in the fall only for its Ph.D. program. (Please note that there is no separate M.A. program in philosophy.1) Application may be made online. Applicants must submit official transcripts, three letters of recommendation, official GRE scores (no advanced subject test is required), and a sample of philosophical writing. The application deadline is 2 January.The preliminary requirements for the Ph.D. are satisfied by demonstrating competence in logic, philosophy of science, language, and mind, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, and history of philosophy. This may be done either by passing prescribed courses with a quality grade or through satisfactory completion of an individually tailored major-minors program, planned in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies and submitted to the department for approval.Within seven semesters of full-time or equivalent residency at Brown, the student must gain admission to Ph.D. candidacy. Admission to candidacy is granted after satisfaction of the preliminary evaluation and distribution requirements and upon approval of a dissertation prospectus by a dissertation committee. An oral defense of the dissertation is required once it is completed.Information about graduate studies in philosophy at Brown University is available in the department's Graduate Student Handbook.Inquiries regarding graduate admissions should be directed to the Graduate School and not to the Director of Graduate Studies. The Director of Graduate Studies is responsible only for the Graduate Program, and plays no role in the admissions process.1This is not to say that the department does not offer a Master of Arts degree. Any student who has completed the preliminary requirements for the Ph.D. is eligible to be awarded an M.A. It is sometimes taken as a terminal degree by those who decide, for whatever reason, not to complete the Ph.D., but who have completed the preliminary requirements. And it is sometimes taken as a non-terminal degree by students who do intend to complete the Ph.D. but who would just like to receive it. The degree may also be awarded to Brown undergraduates admitted to the A.B./A.M. program. Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe undergraduate concentration in philosophy offers courses covering all of the main areas of the discipline, from epistemology and metaphysics to philosophy of religion, philosophy of literature, and feminist philosophy. It also offers courses covering all the various periods in the  history of philosophy. Concentrators can expect to strengthen their  knowledge of and skills in ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy,  logic, epistemology, metaphysics and philosophy of value. While the concentration provides a strong general education in philosophy, concentrators are required to identify  an area of specialization.Students with questions about the concentration should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Justin Broackes.Students in philosophy will:New concentration requirements became effective in January 2013.  Students who declared their concentration prior to that date are still  subject to the old requirements, which can be found in the University Bulletin.The current requirement is ten courses total of which no more than  one may be below Phil 0350, and at least three of which must be at or  above Phil 0990.Each philosophy concentrator must take:Students are asked to choose a "specialization", consisting of three  related courses from a single area of philosophy, for example: logic and  language; philosophy of science; epistemology; philosophy of mind; moral  philosophy; political philosophy; ancient philosophy; and so forth. At  most one course from the specialization can also be counted for one of  the five area requirements.Concentrators who aim at a general acquaintance with the discipline of philosophy may forgo a specialization and devise an appropriately balanced program of courses beyond the requirements with the approval of the DUS (Director of Undergraduate Studies).No more than one course may fulfill both a general distribution requirement and a specialization requirement.No more than two courses from departments other than the philosophy department may be counted among the ten courses required for the concentration; no more than one of these two outside courses may count towards the three specialization requirements. The specialization and the courses that will fulfill it are standardly declared at some point in the course of the Junior year.  Those making a Concentration Declaration at an earlier time (e.g. at the end of their Sophomore year) may make a provisional choice of courses which can be revised at a later date with the approval of the department's DUS (Director of Undergraduate Studies).Each philosophy concentrator must complete a "capstone". For more information, see the page on the senior year.Philosophy concentrators have the option of writing an Honor's Thesis,  which is typically researched and written over the course of the entire  senior year. Interested students should consult with the concentration  advisor during the sixth semester concerning procedures and  requirements.  Philosophy GPA must be greater than 3.5.  (This refers to the GPA at the beginning of the senior year in all philosophy courses, and including at least six courses.)This page describes the "standard" concentration in Philosophy. There is  also a related but separate concentration in Physics and Philosophy.  More information on that program is available from  the Physics department and from  the Registrar's office.Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownPhilosophy is the systematic and critical study of fundamental questions that arise both in everyday life and through the practice of other disciplines. Some of these questions concern the nature of reality: Is there an external world? What is the relationship between the physical and the mental? Does God exist? Others concern our nature as rational, purposive, and social beings: Do we act freely? Where do our moral obligations come from? How do we construct just political states? Others concern the nature and extent of our knowledge: What is it to know something rather than merely believe it? Does all of our knowledge come from sensory experience? Are there limits to our knowledge? And still others concern the foundations and implications of other disciplines: What is a scientific explanation? What sort of knowledge of the world does science provide? Do scientific theories, such as evolutionary theory, or quantum mechanics, compel us to modify our basic philosophical understanding of, and approach to, reality? What makes an object a work of art? Are aesthetic value judgments objective? And so on.The aim in Philosophy is not to master a body of facts, so much as think clearly and sharply through any set of facts. Towards that end, philosophy students are trained to read critically, analyze and assess arguments, discern hidden assumptions, construct logically tight arguments, and express themselves clearly and precisely in both speech and writing.Here are descriptions of some of the main areas of philosophy:Epistemology studies questions about knowledge and rational belief.  Traditional questions include the following: How can we know that the ordinary physical objects around us are real (as opposed to dreamed, or hallucinated, as in the Matrix)?  What are the factors that determine whether a belief is rational or irrational?  What is the difference between knowing something and just believing it?  (Part of the answer is that you can have false beliefs, but you can only know things that are true.  But that’s not the whole answer—after all, you might believe something true on the basis of a lucky guess, and that wouldn’t be knowledge!)   Some other questions that have recently been the subject of lively debate in epistemology include: Can two people with exactly the same evidence be completely rational in holding opposite beliefs?  Does whether I know something depend on how much practical risk I would face if I believed falsely?  Can I rationally maintain confident beliefs about matters on which I know that others, who are seemingly every bit as intelligent, well-informed, unbiased and diligent as I am, have come to opposite conclusions?Metaphysics is the study of what the world is like—or (some would say) what reality consists in. Metaphysical questions can take several forms. They can be questions about what exists (questions of ontology); they can be questions what is fundamental (as opposed to derivative); and they can be questions about what is an objective feature of the world (as opposed to a mere consequence the way in which creatures like us happen to interact with that world). Questions that are central to the study of metaphysics include questions about the nature of objects, persons, time, space, causation, laws of nature, and modality. The rigorous study of these questions has often led metaphysicians to make surprising claims. Plato thought that alongside the observable, concrete world there was a realm of eternal, unchanging abstract entities like Goodness, Beauty, and Justice. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz claimed that the world was composed of tiny indivisible souls, called monads. Even today contemporary metaphysicians have been known to doubt the existence of ordinary objects, to deny the possibility of free will, and to argue that our world is just one of a plurality of worlds.Logic is the study of the validity of patterns of inference. Logic is not a branch of psychology: It does not concern how people actually reason or which kinds of reasoning they find intuitively compelling. Rather, logic concerns the question of when a claim is conclusively supported by other claims. For instance, the inference from the claims “it is raining” and “if it is raining then the streets are wet” to the claim “the streets are wet” is logically valid – the premises conclusively support the conclusion. The validity of this specific inference, and of other inferences of the same form, is tied to the nature of the concept “if … then”. More generally, the notion of logical validity is closely connected to the nature of concepts such as “and”, “or”, “not”, “if … then”, “all”, and “some”. In studying the notion of logical validity, logicians have developed symbolic languages. These enable us to state claims clearly and precisely, and to investigate the exact structure of an argument. These languages have turned out to be useful within philosophy and other disciplines, including mathematics and computer science. Some of the questions about logic studied by members of the philosophy department include: Given that logic is not an empirical science, how can we have knowledge of basic logical truths? What is the connection between logic and rationality? Can mathematics be reduced to logic? Should we revise logic to accommodate vague or imprecise language? Should we revise logic to answer the liar paradox and other paradoxes concerning truth? Political philosophy is the philosophical study of concepts and values associated with political matters. For one example, is there any moral obligation to do what the law says just because the law says so, and if so on what grounds? Many have said we consent to obey. Did you consent to obey the laws? Can one consent without realizing it? Are there other grounds for an obligation to obey the law? Another central question is what would count as a just distribution of all the wealth and opportunity that is made possible by living in a political community? Is inequality in wealth or income unjust? Much existing economic inequality is a result of different talents, different childhood opportunities, different gender, or just different geographical location. What might justify inequalities that are owed simply to bad luck? Some say that inequality can provide incentives to produce or innovate more, which might benefit everyone. Others say that many goods belong to individuals before the law enters in, and that people may exchange them as they please even if this results in some having more than others. So (a third question), what does it mean for something to be yours, and what makes it yours? The Philosophy of Language is devoted to the study of questions concerned with meaning and communication. Such questions range from ones that interact closely with linguistic theory to questions that are more akin to those raised in the study of literature. Very large questions include: What is linguistic meaning? How is the meaning of linguistic performances similar to and different from the meanings of, say, gestures or signals? What is the relationship between language and thought? Is thought more fundamental than language? Or is there some sense in which only creatures that can speak can think? To what extent does the social environment affect the meaning and use of language? Other questions focus on the communicative aspect of language, such as: What is it to understand what someone else has said? What is it to assert something? How is assertion related to knowledge and belief? And how is it that we can gain knowledge from others through language? Yet other questions focus on specific features of the langauges we speak, for example: What is it a name to be a name of a particular thing? What's the relationship between the meanings of words and the meanings of sentences? Is there an important difference between literal and figurative uses of language? What is metaphor? And how does it work?Ethics is the study of what we ought to do and what sorts of people we ought to be.  Ethicists theorize about what makes acts right and wrong and what makes outcomes good and bad, and also about which motivations and traits of character we should admire and cultivate.  Some other questions that ethicists try to answer are closely related to the central ones. They include: What does it mean to act freely? Under what conditions are we responsible for our good and bad acts? Are moral claims true and false, like ordinary descriptive claims about our world, and if they are what makes them so?     [forthcoming]The History of Philosophy plays a special role in the study of philosophy. Like every other intellectual discipline, philosophy has of course a history.  However, in the case of philosophy an understanding of its history - from its ancient and medieval beginnings through the early modern period (the 17th and 18th centuries) and into more recent times - forms a vital part of the very enterprise of philosophy, whether in metaphysics and epistemology or in ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy.  To study the great philosophical works of the past is to learn about the origins and presuppositions of many of the problems that occupy philosophy today.  It is also to discover and to come to appreciate different ways of dealing with these problems, different conceptions of what the fundamental problems of philosophy are, and indeed different ways of doing philosophy altogether.  And it is also the study of works—from Plato and Aristotle, through Kant and Mill and more recent writers—that have shaped much of Western culture far beyond academic philosophy. Many of the most creative philosophers working today have also written on various topics in the history of philosophy and have found their inspiration in great figures of the past. This question may be understood in two ways: Why would one engage in the particular intellectual activities that constitute philosophical inquiry? And how might the study of philosophy affect my future career prospects? Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThere are several options for a 'Capstone Experience' in philosophy.Seniors wishing to earn honors by presenting a senior honors thesis should consult their concentration advisor during their sixth semester or at the start of the seventh semester, concerning procedures and requirements. In addition to completing the usual nonhonors requirements, a student must write a thesis judged to be of honors quality by two readers and have a grade point average of over 3.5 in philosophy courses.  (The GPA at the beginning of the senior year must be greater than 3.5, including at least six courses, of which at least five must be taken for a letter grade; and the GPA must be at least 3.5 at the end of the Senior year.) Honors theses are usually prepared over two semesters' work with an advisor. There is more information on writing an honors thesis on this page.Many professors will be happy to set up a Phil 1990 reading course for one semester with an individual student, e.g. leading to the preparation of a special large paper on a particular topic of research. One option is to set up a Reading Course to accompany a 1000-level course that you have recently taken or are taking at the same time. For example, you might take Phil 1660 Metaphysics, and also do a special reading course on Necessity or on Reduction and Supervenience. Or you might take Phil 1640, The Nature of Morality, and also do a reading course to specialize in the notion of Moral Facts. In each case the 1000-level course would provide a general overview of the topic and give you an idea of one professor's views, and then you could research further in the subject either with that same professor or with another with overlapping interests. A one-semester Reading Course may also for some people be a first step towards writing an Honors Thesis.There are seminars in the Phil 0990 series, aimed primarily at advanced undergraduates, on varying topics each year.2000-level seminars are mainly aimed at graduate students, but many are able to take advanced undergraduates as well. The best preparation is usually to have done a 1000-level course with the same professor or in the same general area of philosophy.Please feel free to talk to the Concentration Advisors about ideas and questions you might have about any of these options or to approach in office hours individual professors who might be able to help you as an advisor for a particular project.Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

						© 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThere is no requirement for people concentrating in Philosophy to write an Undergraduate Honors Thesis; some people do so, many people don't.To write a thesis, you need a topic and an Advisor and a suitable amount of time. There is no single model to follow, but one standard approach is this. You'd work on the thesis during the two semesters of your Senior Year. In the first semester, you might work through a reading program with the advice of your Advisor, meeting with her or him three or four times in the semester and writing two or three pieces of work—for example, discussions of existing publications in the field and sketches of your own responses to them. Over the break you'd pull together a plan for the thesis itself. In the second semester, you'd write a first draft of the thesis and then a final draft—expecting, of course, that you would continue to do some new reading, and that you might need to be flexible with your original plan. The thesis itself is due about April 15th (or more exactly, two weeks before the Friday on which the Reading Period begins).It is possible in principle to choose a topic which you don't know much about in advance; but typically the result of that is that you have to spend a larger amount of time reaching base camp, so to speak—getting a decent grasp of existing approaches to the topic—and you have less time for heading up to the summit—developing ideas of your own. Many of the best theses come when a student has already got some idea of a problem area, e.g. from a 1000 level course that might have spent a week or two on the detailed topic in question, and might have introduced the class to materials and methods used in related areas that might constitute a useful tool-kit for this topic too. If you already know a bit about the existing approaches to the topic, but have a feeling that you're not quite satisfied with any of them, then you're probably in a good position to go deeper into it, researching further proposals from other people and working out a distinctive contribution of your own.When you have a first idea of the area in which you'd like to work, you can approach a potential advisor direct, e.g. by e-mail or in Office Hours, or you can discuss the matter with your Concentration Advisor, who should be able to point you towards Faculty Members with interests in areas close to your proposed topic. Don't let your ideas become too fixed too early: often a good discussion will leave you thinking of unexpected directions you'll want to head off in. The normal time for approaching an Advisor is in the first week of the first semester of your Senior Year (or a few days earlier), or at the end of the last semester of the Junior Year.The standard thing is to register for a reading course, PHIL 1995 Senior Thesis, either for the first semester alone or for both first and second semesters, with the permission of the Advisor in question. (Note that PHIL 1995 takes on a different section number according to who the Advisor is.)You can register for PHIL 1995 just for one semester (followed by registering for either 3 or 4 classes in the other semester). Alternatively, you can register for PHIL 1995 for a second semester. Which you do is a matter for negotiation with your advisor, taking into account, e.g. the number of meetings, and the amount and scope of reading and writing that is done. Obviously the work-load for a Reading course needs to be about the equivalent of a normal course.There's no standard length, but 40–50 pages of carefully-argued material would for many topics be a good target.Two copies of the Thesis are due by the Friday two weeks before the Friday on which the Reading Period begins, which will usually fall close to April 15th. They are to be handed in to the Thesis Advisor. Theses should be computer-printed, on one side only of paper; they do not need to be bound. Some people like to present them in a special folder or binder; this is fine, but not required.There is usually no oral defense of the thesis. The Thesis Advisor will normally be one Reader of the thesis; there will be a second Reader too, appointed by the Concentration Advisor in consultation with the Thesis Advisor.Department ChairPaul GuyerDirector of Graduate StudiesChristopher HillDirector of Undergraduate StudiesJustin BroackesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
