Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignMellon Initiative for Graduate Study in Curatorial Preparedness and Object-Based LearningGraduate students in History of Art at Berkeley have the option of participating in a three-year pilot program sponsored by the Mellon Foundation supplementing academic training with curatorial skills. Starting in the fall of 2013, graduate seminars will have more museum, collection, and site visits, and a new course will be offered on object analysis in museum conservation studios and sites of production.  Students will also have the opportunity to help produce an exhibition using Berkeley’s far-ranging object collections.   Additionally, each semester an advanced graduate student will have the opportunity to intern in a collection rich in the materials that form the focus of his or her special expertise. In Fall 2013 William Ma will be at the Peabody-Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts.  In Spring 2014 Laure Marest-Caffey will be at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, serving as Curatorial Intern.  She will be working on exhibition, acquisition, and research projects in the Department of Art of the Ancient World, Classical Section, as well as studying the MFA's remarkable collection of Hellenistic portrait gems, which are the focus of her dissertation.  The purpose of the Mellon initiative is to give students greater flexibility in career direction, and to enrich their art historical research with knowledge of materials and workmanship, with stronger links to museum collections and staff, and with a broader intellectual toolbox.

Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignUNDERGRADUATES WHO BECAME ART HISTORY LIBRARIANS
by Kathryn WaynePhoto caption:  Alex Watkins, Norlin Library, University of Colorado, BoulderAs the Head of the Art History/Classics Library, one of the most enjoyable aspects of my job is to interact with a strong and diverse group of students and faculty.  Over the years, I have had several opportunities to mentor students who were interested in pursuing the field of art librarianship.  In this column, I am pleased to highlight two History of Art undergraduates, Barbara Rominski (1999) and Alex Watkins (2007).  Please read on for their inspiring stories.BARBARA ROMINSKI (History of Art BA1999)UC Berkeley was an obvious choice when I decided to pursue my undergraduate degree, studying both art and archaeology, from Greek and Roman studies to the Northern Renaissance and Asian arts.  In 1998, I had the privilege of serving as an undergraduate representative on a committee for a proposed new Visual Arts Library, chaired by Fine Arts Librarian Kathryn Wayne.  She was the person who also helped guide me to my next degree—a Master’s in Library Science—when she counseled, “you love art, you love books and libraries, why not become an art librarian?”While earning my degree at San Jose State University, I had the good fortune to serve as the Achenbach Graphic Arts Council (AGAC) Fellow, where I worked with the Reva and David Logan Illustrated Book Collection.  After the fellowship, I stayed on as a project liaison with the Anderson Graphic Art Collection, giving me an introduction to Hunk and Moo Anderson, private collectors in the Bay Area. Later, Hunk Anderson hired me to help manage and tour his private collection of art and to assist with his foundation. 

In 2003, I was hired as the Head of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s Research Library.  As SFMOMA’s third librarian, I have established the SFMOMA Institutional Archives and Institutional Records Management Program.   Looking forward, I am excited to design and shape SFMOMA’s new library in our Snøhetta expansion.  Art librarianship has, most assuredly, been a rich and rewarding career!ALEXANDER C. WATKINS (History of Art BA 2008)When I saw Fine Arts Librarian Kathryn Wayne at a recent Art Libraries Society of North America conference, I was brought back to how I got on the path to becoming an art librarian. When I began as an undergraduate at Berkeley, I wasn't much of a researcher, until I took Professor Elizabeth Honig’s Gender and Representation class, where Kathryn led a research seminar.  Her enthusiasm really opened my eyes to the value of good research and the unlimited potential that Berkeley's world-class library represented. Doe Library became like a second home, as I spent countless hours there, working for ILL, working on my assignments, and working as a research assistant for HA professors.After graduating I worked in a public library and then decided to go to Pratt Institute where I was able to get a dual Master’s Degree in both art history and library science. Living in New York City had great advantages as I was able to study and work at some of the best museums and libraries in the country (Met, Columbia, New York Public Library).  In July 2012, I was pleased to be hired as Assistant Professor and Art & Architecture Librarian at the University of Colorado Boulder where I work closely with the Program in Environmental Design and the Department of Art & Art History. I love my job, and, like Kathryn, I now get to teach classes on research methods, consult on research projects, and develop the collection of books, journals, and databases.

Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignThe seminar and residency will explore the work of the most influential psychoanalyst writing in English today, Christopher Bollas, who will be scholar-in-residence at the Townsend Center in the first week of November 2016. Bollas is widely known for his pioneering, polymathic, and maverick investigations of unconscious perception of objects and the object world, including human beings—work that has been highly suggestive for many domains of the humanities and social sciences—and more recently for his exploration of fractured unconsciousness (anxiety, hysteria, breakdown, and schizophrenia). Prior to Bollas’s visit, we will discuss his published works (including The Freudian Moment, The Shadow of the Object, Being a Character, and When the Sun Bursts: The Enigma of Schizophrenia) as well as forthcoming and in-progress work that he will provide. Students will present their own projects to the group, and will develop questions to be discussed in seminars with Bollas himself and for one-on-one meetings with him during his residency.Three seminar sessions will be convened by Professor Whitney Davis (History of Art) and will meet on three Wednesdays (September 21 and October 5 and 18) from 5:15 – 7 pm, at the Townsend Center. Participants must attend these seminars; the events of Bollas’s residency, which will take place in the afternoons/early evenings of October 31 and November 1, 2 and 3; and one-on-one meetings with Bollas.The seminar is open to graduate students in any program, for 1-unit credit. Students can register for the course by enrolling in Rhetoric 244A, History of Art 298, or Comparative Literature 298.  Advance communication with and permission of the instructor required (wmdavis@berkeley.edu). You may also contact the Townsend Center at tansmana@berkeley.edu.

    Gregory Levine, 
  TuTh 11-1230P, 102 MOFFITTThis course—and introductory survey—asks you to look precisely at art and architecture in or associated with Japan, doing so with a sort of “double-vision.” By this I mean the following: we can, and should, study a work’s visual-material and contextual place in the past. What, for instance, was the significance of the Great Buddha at the Buddhist monastery Tōdaiji in the 8th century? What did its iconography, form, and scale signify within imperial rule and East Asian Buddhism? That’s one modality of inquiry, and we might tag it “synchronic” or “historicist” (concerned with meaning at a particular moment in time). But there’s another mode—“diachronic” or “dialectical,” perhaps—that invites us to be nimble in how we “study the past.” Are the meanings of the Great Buddha in the 8th century, the 1930s, and 2012 the same, or have the statue’s meanings and affecting and ideological powers accumulated unevenly, shifted over time? Are there particular sorts of “modern looking” (including “art historical looking”) that we need to assess? What might we learn from the potential tensions, slippages, or continuities between the distant past, more recent periods, and the present? Take the 19th-century woodblock print known as the Great Wave. Although this famous print/image seems so obviously “Japanese,” it’s visual content, context, and reception turn out to be more complicated and less purely “Japanese” than we might think—and, consequently, more fascinating and important. And if we turn to the study of contemporary works of art and architecture in Japan, how should we consider their relationships to the visual/material past and the so-called “Japanese Tradition”? There is no prerequisite for this course, and students from all majors and disciplines are welcome.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 100 | CCN: 04910   | 4 Units

    Whitney Davis, 
  MW 4-530P, 102 MOFFITTRequired of majors in History of Art. This course introduces theories and methods of art history that have played a major role in its intellectual and professional formation from the later eighteenth century to the present day. The approach is partly historiographical and partly analytic. Readings will be drawn from key texts by major art-writers, art theorists, and art historians; lectures will present historical contexts and analytical critique. Special attention will be given to the adequacy of established art-historical paradigms of formal, stylistic, and iconographic analysis in dealing with the “expanded field” of visual studies and image theory today, including the rise of visual culture studies and studies of scientific and other putatively non-artistic modes of visualization, the displacement of studies of “the object” into studies of “the image,” and the increasing importance of new technologies of art historical documentation, pedagogy, and historical reconstruction. (Guest lectures will be presented by specialists in these areas.) In addition, some consideration will be given to the professional structure of art history and visual studies as an increasingly “globalized” mode of inquiry and to the educational and professional opportunities for students who are considering going on to advanced degrees or employment in art-history related fields. Previous coursework in art history is not required and non-majors are encouraged to take the course, but students will find it helpful to have completed lower-division and at least one upper-division course in art history and/or related fields (e.g., film studies or art practice). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA C121A | CCN: 04922   | 4 Units

    Heba Mostafa, 
  TuTh 2-330P, 103 MOFFITTThis course introduces the art and architecture of the Islamic world, examining transformations from pre-Islam up to the present. The course explores the main features of the built environment of Muslim communities throughout the Central Islamic lands, Central Asia and Spain with emphasis upon the Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid and Seljuk periods. The course explores the range of cultural, political, social and religious aspects related to the development of the visual culture. This involves an examination of the impact of Islam’s encounter with late antiquity and aims to explain the rise of Islamic architecture as a cultural product of this encounter. It also aims to challenge notions of Islamic art as a straightforward synthesis of the art and architecture of the late antique and ancient near eastern world.  The development of Islam’s architectural manifestations is cast within the context of the development of its institutions to aid in the understanding of the rise of the seminal building types of Islam. The course begins by introducing the rise of the mosque, the early palace and the shrine during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods within the context of the development of praxis as well as overarching political and cultural shifts. Furthermore it aims to examine the later development of Islamic architecture through a rigorous understanding of the seminal shifts in the development of the culture as a whole within the context of the surrounding polities. The course will also touch upon aspects of the development of the Medieval Islamic city in light of the development of the seminal institutions of palace/citadel, the evolution of the religious complex as well as the economic centers. The course concludes with an assessment of the place of architecture within contemporary Islamic communities.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 131A  | CCN: 04934   | 4 Units

    Patricia Berger, 
  TuTh 1230-2P, 106 MOFFITTThis course deals with two millennia of art that was produced in China to serve ritual purposes and especially with the role that images played in defining doctrine and belief in two traditions: Daoism and Buddhism. We begin with a look at some of the problems early artists in China faced in their attempts to represent the sublime bodies of perfected Daoist immortals and the Buddha Śākyamuni. We will consider the translation of imported Buddhist images into legible Chinese forms before turning to such issues as the relationship of image to sacred text, personal practice, public ritual, and political propaganda, the ongoing conversation between Daoist and Buddhist artists, the assimilation of Tibetan thought and style in China, and the effect of foreign rule and patronage on Chinese and Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhist art. Specific visual forms developed by established schools of Daoism and Buddhism and by popular movements, especially the cults surrounding the Daoist Queen Mother of the West and the Buddhist bodhisattva of mercy Guanyin (Avalokiteśvara) will also be central themes.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA C156B | CCN: 05027   | 4 Units

    Beate Fricke, Massimo Mazzotti
  TuTh 930-11A, 145 DWINELLEIn this course we explore the intersections of art and science in medieval, modern, and contemporary history. Our aim is twofold. First, to show the close interaction between these two fields, and of the way in which historically they have shaped each other. Leonardo, Galileo, Darwin and Einstein acted at the threshold between these two fields. Second, to turn specific instances of art/science interaction into the prism through which one can reach a fuller understanding of major historical transformations. Gutenberg and Leonardo will be the pivotal Renaissance figures, while the rise of Newtonian science and the Romantic revolution will guide us into the contemporary experience of the art/science interaction, up to the current transformation of both fields through computing and digital media. The course takes the form of a longue-durée overview that spans from the awakening of European culture through the reception of new knowledge from the Near East to the most recent encounters between artistic and scientific practice in the 21st century. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 172 | CCN: 04970   | 4 Units

  TuTh 330-5P, 102 MOFFITTIn the seventeenth century, the Dutch Republic (what we now call Holland) was home to a rich and unique visual culture; it was also perhaps the first truly modern society. In this course, we will study Dutch pictures with a view to understanding the artistic concerns of their makers, as well as how their imagery related to the society for which they were made.  Netherlandish artists had long had a reputation for meticulous craftsmanship and for careful observation and description of the visual world.  In the seventeenth century, they turned their sights to local landscapes and cities, to portraiture and still life, and to scenes of daily life—domestic, commercial, and festive—while also producing great history paintings.  We will consider the meaning and function of these various "genres" of painting, their status as art objects, and the goals of the artists—from the giants like Rembrandt and Vermeer to the more ordinary skilled craftsmen and thinkers—who made them. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 175 | CCN: 04982   | 4 Units

  TuTh 930-11A, 106 MOFFITTThis course will examine French art and visual culture from the 16th century to the mid-18th century. Beginning with the architecture, processions, painting, prints and decorative arts of the School of Fontainebleau, the course addresses the development of the Royal Academy and its interaction with popular culture, which culminates in the display of ambitious art in the public space of the pre-revolutionary Salon exhibition. We will examine Classical triumphal processions that included the spectacle of Brazilian tribal warfare; the appreciation and collecting of intimate canvases (Poussin); the early modern state’s investment in urban renewal in Paris and cultural spectacle at Versailles; the intimate and complex objects and spaces in Rococo interiors (Watteau, Boucher) and public forms of display and art criticism (Chardin, Diderot). Among our inquiries will be Feminist court culture, the literary and material cultures of humanism, the transmission of ancient Roman antiquity, models of popular and elite culture, female portraiture and the myth of, aristocratic cultural resistance and connoisseurship, the optical and philosophical furniture of the French Enlightenment, and the emergence of modern artistic institutions (public art exhibitions, lectures, academic studio training and formal art criticism). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 182 | CCN: 04994   | 4 Units

  TuTh 2-330P, 160 KROEBERThis course examines the history and strangeness of this medium from its simultaneous invention in more than one country during the early nineteenth century to its practice by artists (and non-artists) today. We will introduce students to the rich theoretical literature on the medium as well as the historical circumstances of its production. Throughout the course we will examine how photography was deployed by the state as well as by the marginalized; we will also examine its roles in the construction of gender, class, and race. Among topics to be considered are photography during the civil war and the Civil Rights movement; photography in nineteenth-century England and France; the mutual construction of photography and anthropology; the use of photography in global Conceptualisms; the "queer camera;" and citizen journalism. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190B / Classics 130 | CCN: 05015   | 4 Units

  MWF 10-11A, 106 MOFFITTImportant individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits—bronze and marble statues set up in public places—and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements.  In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals.  We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary, and to understand the sometimes-similar functions they serve.  But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences that this has for the way we, as historians, must approach them.  Ancient authors to be sampled in this course: Plutarch, Xenophon, Plato, Diogenes Laertius, Augustus, Suetonius, the Scriptores Historiae Augustae, and the Panegyrici Latini. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190G | CCN: 05065   | 4 Units

    
  MWF 9-10A, 102 MOFFITTRather than offering a broad survey, this lecture course will examine some of the key episodes and developments in British art in the period, from J.A.M. Whistler’s radical Falling Rocket—a painting so apparently slapdash and formless that it led to a bitter libel case—to the Young British Artists—whose arrival on the art scene in the late twentieth century likewise sparked controversy. Each lecture will focus on a significant movement, exhibition, artist, genre, or medium, and the emphasis throughout will be on close visual analysis. We will consider the dichotomy of tradition and modernity, challenging any notion of straightforward “progress,” and looking instead at the ways in which artists have seemed radical for their time and also drawn inspiration from the past. The course will explore a range of media, incorporating not only painting and sculpture but also the decorative arts and installation art, from the Arts and Crafts movement to Grayson Perry’s ceramics and Damien Hirst’s multi-media works. Alongside British artists the course will look at foreign-born artists working and exhibiting in Britain. Topics may include artistic communities such as the Bloomsbury Group and St. Ives; experiments with abstraction by Barbara Hepworth and Bridget Riley; the treatment of the body in the work of Henry Moore and Lucian Freud; and innovations in sculpture by Jacob Epstein and Anthony Caro. The art of the period will be considered against the background of Britain’s expanding and then diminishing empire, two devastating world wars, and the rise of feminism, amongst other important historical developments.  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192A | CCN: 05066   | 4 Units

    Qamar Adamjee, 
  M 230-530P, 425 DOE LIBRARYFigural art, both in the form of sculpture and painting, comprises much of art production from India. There is a wide variety in the modes of depicting the human body – over time, region, and across media. In this seminar we will explore various topics pertaining to the representation of the human form in Indian art. These include questions about stylization and “realism”, idealization and sensuousness, composite bodies; relationships between form and function; questions relating to portraiture and the modes of capturing  the “likeness” of an individual; the body as transcribed onto temple architecture; issues about gender, sexuality and the gaze; and the reception of Indian art in museum display contexts. In addition to critical secondary literature, readings will include excerpts from texts in translation, such as the Natyasastra (a treatise on the performing arts), the Citralakshana (a treatise on aesthetics), and the Kamasutra (a treatise on sexual and moral codes). The course will be structured around active participation in class discussions, visits to the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, and a final research paper.

    Lisa Trever, 
  Tu 10-1P, 425 DOE LIBRARYIn this seminar we will study the mural paintings of palaces, temples, and tombs from pre-Hispanic Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru. Our corpus includes the ancient Maya sites of San Bartolo, Bonampak, Xultún, and Calakmul; Teotihuacan and Cacaxtla in Central Mexico; and the South American sites of Ventarrón, Moche, Huaca Cao, Pañamarca, and others. Emphasis will be on the early, pre-Mexica (Aztec) and pre-Inca periods, but we will also consider colonial and modern legacies of indigenous subjects and mural painters in Latin America. Areas of discussion include: artistic techniques and materials, iconography, text and image, narrative and ornament, style and ethnicity, courtly culture and religious practice. We will also discuss the pragmatics of conservation and illustration and the politics of “discovery,” collection, and exportation of cultural patrimony. Readings will be drawn from art historical and archaeological literature and critical sources on space and proxemics, the built environment, and embodiment. Spanish reading ability is useful, but all required readings will be in English. No prior knowledge of Pre-Columbian or Latin American art history is required. A visit to the Harald Wagner collection of Teotihuacan murals at the deYoung Museum is expected.

  Tu 2-5P, 308B DOE LIBRARYDespite the fact that tapestry played a pivotal role in the art, liturgy, and propaganda of the courts and churches of late medieval and early modern Europe, in later centuries the medium was long and largely overlooked by art historians and became prey to many misconceptions.In fact,tapestry scholarship proper only began to mature in the 1970s and 1980s, reaching a zenith in the highly acclaimed Tapestry in the Renaissance and Tapestry in the Baroque exhibitions organized at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in 2002 and 2007.As Peter Paul Rubens Chair for the History and Culture of the Southern Low Countries, I would like to examine the history, meaning and function of Flemish and French tapestry from the early seventeenth century to the late eighteenth century and the ways in which our understanding of the medium is shaped by different approaches. Thus, the aim of the seminar is twofold. First, to analyze and criticize the history of tapestry history as it has developed since the middle of the nineteenth century. We will read key texts (most of which were written in English; there will be about five shorter articles written in French) that will give us a comprehensive survey of what has always been considered to be “the” history of Flemish and French baroque and rococo tapestry – a history that evolves around ‘star players’ Rubens, French King Louis XIV and François Boucher; the texts will also allow us to define traditional methodologies and their limitations and pitfalls. Second, to introduce and explore possible new approaches and avenues of research through which we can reach a fuller understanding of tapestry – a new history that is firmly rooted in archival evidence and that uses the socio-economic dimension of the medium (the patterns of the production and trading landscape and the social strategies devised by tapestry producers) to explain artistic innovation (or stagnation) and crosscurrents between both major and minor production centers.The seminar is accompanied by the international symposium “Woven Paintings”? Flemish and French Tapestry, 1660–1770 (Berkeley, 22–23 November 2013; co-organized by Professor Elizabeth Honig, Professor Katlijne Van der Stighelen and myself) that will bring together leading tapestry scholars from Europe and the US.

  M 10-1P, 308B DOE LIBRARYInstructor Approval RequiredThis course proposes to explore the Renaissance origins of three closely interrelated stylistic categories, the Gothic, grotesque, and arabesque, and the ways in which they engage with the perceived alterity of ornament.  Both the Gothic and grotesque were defined in terms of bodily deformity, femininity, perverse hybridity, and lack of regulation and control, and used to characterize the foreignness of the arabesque, and vice versa.  This course will interrogate the anxieties (and perhaps latent desires) underlying the formation and perception of these categories, including xenophobia, misogyny, and fear of the irrational and exotic.  Although we will closely examine early modern Italian and French illustrated books, prints, and buildings, the seminar will draw from other fields to consider the role of images in the uncontrollable reproduction and dissemination of ornament.  From this perspective, the course will also revisit some of the seminal texts on the theorization of ornament, including Henri Focillon’s Vie des Formes and Alois Riegl’s Stilfragen, as well as more recent art historical scholarship, including Alina Payne’s From Ornament to Object, Ethan Matt Kavaler’s Renaissance Gothic, and Gulru Necipoglu’s Topkapi Scroll. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192F.1 / HA 281 | CCN: 05069   | 4 Units

    Whitney Davis, 
  Tu 5-8P, 308B DOE LIBRARYInstructor Approval Required.The seminar develops and tests a comprehensive framework for analysis of pictoriality in the visual field, deploying certain traditions of art-historical reasoning in combination with intellectual resources drawn from philosophical psychology (especially the theory of depiction), visual studies, and phenomenological anthropology. Proceeding from a baseline distinction between images and pictures, it focuses on the matter of “imaging pictures”—that is, how pictures become visible, are “imaged” to have a particular “pictoriality,” in the visual field understood to be subject not only to invariant laws of geometrical optics but also to historically varying constructions of “the visible.” Special attention will be paid to analytic models of “bivisibility” (the dual visibility of objects, even when they are made specifically to be seen, both inside and outside the register of “visuality,” or culturally shaped visualization), “bivirtuality” (the spectrum of pictoriality, or the construction of virtual pictorial space, from states perceived to be continuous with the whole of visual space and states perceived to be discontinuous), and “birotationality” (the susceptibility of any pictorial representation to a topological transformation, greatly enhanced today by rapid electronic processing of digital images, from states of lesser optical foreshortening to states of greater optical foreshortening, or vice versa, with attendant consequences for both bivisibility and bivirtuality). Readings will be drawn largely from art theoretical and art historical literature, whether recent or not, that bears on these analytic considerations, but we will also address other models in present-day image studies. We will pay special attention to the materials being generated in the “Bildwissenschaft & Visual Culture” initiative at the University of Copenhagen in 2013–14 and at the “One-Way Images” conference of the Eikones group at the University of Basel in October 2013. Student projects will investigate relevant historiographies, explore historical and cross-cultural variations in the imaging of pictures (i.e., particular historical constructions and contexts of pictorial bivisibility, bivirtuality, and birotationality), and/or test the strengths and weaknesses of the analytic model(s) in application to examples.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 200 | CCN: 05162   | 4 Units

    Beate Fricke, 
  M 9-12P,The purpose of this course is to familiarize you with the way in which art history has developed since the late 19th century.   It is important that you understand not only where our discipline stands today but also how it got here, since you will be the ones determining where it goes next.  We will proceed chronologically, reading critical texts and also historicizing them, thinking about what concerns were formulated and addressed at what historical moments, how the writing of art history is always of its moment in a way we may (or may not) want to describe as “political.”  I have tried to select readings that are both fundamental to the shaping of our discipline and in some way “typical” of their time, although certain texts really fall only  into one or the other category.  By the end of the semester, you should feel fairly knowledgeable about the historiography of our field and should be able to use that knowledge to think critically about current art history writing and, eventually, about your own place in the field. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 230 | CCN: 05165   | 4 Units

  Th 12-2P, 308B DOE LIBRARYInstructor approval required. This seminar satisfies a University-wide requirement that all first-time Graduate Student Instructors take a pedagogy course. It can be taken concurrently with a first teaching assignment or in the semester before beginning teaching. The class will encourage you to think in larger terms about the function of pedagogy in art history–what we learn, what we teach, who we are as teachers in this field. You should learn how to lead a good section and how to grade exams effectively, but also how to help students think and write in visual terms, how to guide them to a more critical mode of reading, how to direct them in independent research, and how to ensure that they work to the best of their potential.Beyond that, this class is a pre-professional workshop, designed to help you plan what your teaching will be like when you are designing and instructing courses on your own. Throughout the semester you will be thinking about a class that you would like to teach some day in your field. You will make up paper assignments and exams for that class, and eventually you will draft a syllabus and part of your first lecture for that class. Your final project will be a “teaching portfolio” which will incorporate your syllabus, assignments, and a “teaching statement” explaining your personal philosophy of teaching. We will also be talking about the job market, interviewing, and job talks. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 108 | CCN: 14653   | 4 Units

Beginning with the hybrid material culture of Mission Dolores in eighteenth- century New Spain, we shall progress chronologically and thematically through a sequence of case studies designed to reveal a broad range of art-practical engagements with notions of individual and collective identity. Material, formal, social, and political contexts will all be considered as we address a wide range of art practices and media, including, among others, sculpture, land art, costume, mural painting, photography, architecture, and conceptual art. Additionally, we shall attend to the methods by which knowledge about the works and practices under consideration has been produced, thinking in part about the roles that those methods themselves have played in the identity politics of academic and curatorial research. This course statisfies the American Cultures requirement.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 11 | CCN: 14645   | 4 Units

Our seminar will focus on the art of Vermeer but will try to put his works in dialogue with the paintings of his contemporaries that we can see in person at the exhibition. We will think about concepts like humor, noise, resemblance, seduction, habitat, and objecthood in Dutch painting, comparing Vermeer’s treatment of these things to the way other painters handled them. In this class you will learn to think critically about works of art within a historical context, and to write about visual form, effect, and experience. The class will visit the De Young exhibition together with the professor at least once, early in the semester, so that we can talk about the materials and effects of the images as physical objects. Enrollment is limited to eighteen students. No previous art history is required, only enthusiasm and curiosity, but be prepared for a steep learning curve if you are new to this field. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 11 | CCN: 04827   | 4 Units

    Jessica Maxwell, 
  MW 530-7P, 425 DOE LIBRARYBy 1900, famous sculptor Auguste Rodin and others of his cohort successfully renovated the traditional practice of sculpture -- the academic modeling of ideal figures based on neoclassical precedents in celebration of national heroes, institutions and middle class values. In its place, arose the beginning of 'modern sculpture'--the conveyance of the sculptor's personalized vision of man in contemporary society. This lecture course will explore closely such sculpture and its critical revisions throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  Key sculptural models of focus will include direct carving, constructed sculpture, and thereadymade or found object.  Mapping modern sculpture's passage from its principle of 'truth to materials' in the face of the world's growing industrialization to its eventual collapse with the everyday commodity, together these models reveal the historic instability of the medium's form, meaning and purpose. Attending to the writings of leading theorists, critics, and practitioners, we will examine modern sculpture from its inception to its recent manifestation as an art seeking to reestablish for sculpture a basis that is both more structurally specific and conceptually secure. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190F.3 | CCN: 05058   | 4 Units

  MWF 11-12P, 223 DWINELLEThe course surveys critical controversies surrounding fakes, forgeries, imitations, and appropriations from the Late Renaissance to the present day, in European, American, Australian and Chinese art. Each of the images and objects we will examine sparked extensive debates in art history, philosophy, anthropology, social theory or legal studies, around which we will build our own discussions. Through a series of historical case studies, we will track how copies are excised—and sometimes reinstated—into the status of art, and delve into the impact of the copy on the rhetorics of authorship, genius, individuality, expertise and technology. Students will read key texts on the copy in varying cultural contexts, and examine the disciplinary methods taken up to define and evaluate it. They will also develop a critical awareness for the rhetorics of visual and material analysis, and for the plethora of ways in which artists and theorists have utilized the copy to reveal the institutional, legal, aesthetic and social boundaries of art.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 62 | CCN: 04909   | 4 Units

  MW 3-4P, 20 BARROWSThe Italian Renaissance is often described as the beginning of modernity. This is because the Renaissance is the first coherent articulation of a number of ideas – from the role of the individual within society to the rise of capitalism – that are closely associated with notions of “modern”. In this interdisciplinary course, we will discuss the various aspects of Renaissance life and culture that made this era both distinct within and formative for the history of western society. We will focus primarily on art, literature and political philosophy to draw a picture of the major cultural forces shaping the Renaissance. You will encounter many famous figures, including Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Miachiavelli, placing these within their social and historical context.  Where possible, the readings will be from the Renaissance itself, either writings of the authors, poets and artists we are studying, or the words of contemporaries writing about them.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 11 | CCN: 04874   | 4 Units

  TuTh 930-11A, 102 MOFFITTThis course is an introduction to visual art in Europe and North America since the 14th century. “Covering” European art and its global legacy over the centuries would result in superficial attention to an overwhelming number of images without regard to their historical significance. Despite the sense of awe experienced by this encounter, the student would feel the same confused panic and exhaustion as the visitor wandering through room after room of displayed objects in a major museum such as the Louvre. This course is designed to introduce students with a diverse range of knowledge and skills to the relationship between art and society through the examination of select objects. In addition to providing a foundational history of a period of tremendous historical change, this course will attempt to provide visual skills that can be adapted to new situations, whether the visual object is historical or contemporary.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 34 | CCN: 04895   | 4 Units

Lectures will survey six millennia of Chinese art thematically and chronologically, including the burial arts of the Neolithic period through the Tang dynasty (4th M. BCE -10th c. CE), Buddhist and Daoist ritual arts, later painting, calligraphy, and arts of the imperial courts, Republican China and the PRC. Lectures, readings and discussions will introduce students to various systems of Chinese thought, modes of visual analysis, and art historical method.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 134A | CCN: 04919   | 4 Units

  TuTh 2-330P, 106 MOFFITTThis course introduces the art and architecture of Buddhist temples/convents in Japan. Whether as a monastic center, private devotional chapel, or popular urban nexus, the temple/convent has comprised a key religious environment in Japan and has had an enduring impact upon architecture and the visual arts. We will examine the architecture and art of selected sites dating from the 8th century onwards, including Hōryūji, Tōdaiji, the Byōdōin, Sanjūsangendō, and Daitokuji, and consider their religious histories and art histories. We will keep an eye on broader themes. What were temple architectural and artistic requirements/what makes architecture and art Buddhist; how did architectural materials/spaces/forms reflect doctrine and condition ritual and belief; what functions did icons, relics, and other numinous objects play in the life of a Buddhist community and what types of architecture developed with them; and how were programs and ensembles of art and architecture developed to meet doctrinal and ritual needs? The course will also consider elite patronage and popular pilgrimage and the dispersal of religious icons into museum and private collections during the 19th and 20th centuries.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 156B | CCN: 04943   | 4 Units

The Gothic cathedral, that most characteristic of medieval creations, has been variously portrayed as a symbol of the Heavenly Jerusalem, a theater for the arts, the supreme example of structural engineering, the reflection of Scholastic ideals, a showcase for “scientific” innovation and cross-cultural exchange, and a visual ‘bible for the poor.’ This course will explore all aspects of artistic endeavor on the Gothic site, from its stone vaulting sustained by flying buttresses and the elaborate carvings on the exterior, to the vibrant stained glass windows, rich metalwork, textiles and illuminated manuscripts adorning the interior. Recent work on the economic and social implications of this kind of large-scale building will place the cathedrals in a broader cultural context. Focus will be on key French and German monuments of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, including Saint-Denis, Laon, Notre-Dame of Paris, Chartres, Reims, Amiens, Freiburg, Trier, Cologne, Naumburg and the Sainte-Chapelle. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 173 | CCN: 04955   | 4 Units

    Elizabeth Honig, 
  TuTh 330-5P, 106 MOFFITTPeter Paul Rubens's contemporaries considered him to be one of the most extraordinary men of his time. Although largely known today as a great painter, Rubens was also a major politician and diplomat, co-architect of important European peace treaties. Moreover, he was a not inconsiderable scho­lar: important humanist thinkers as well as powerful monarchs considered him their friend and peer. This course will consider what it meant for such a man to make art; how his art was integrated into his diplomatic and intellectual life; what functions it served for him; and how it spoke both to past art and to present politics and philosophy. As Rubens was so much part of the international scene of his day, we will consider his art within the broader visual culture of Europe, travelling (along with him) to the Italy of Caravaggio and the Spain of Velazquez; to the England of King Charles I and the Paris of Marie de’ Medici and Cardinal Richelieu. We will also study the massive workshop Rubens ran back in Antwerp, the production models he innovated, and his practice of working collaboratively with other master artists. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 180C | CCN: 04967   | 4 Units

  MW 530-7P, 105 NORTH GATEWhat form can be given to modernity? What were the national, colonial, class and gender politics of modern self-fashioning in late 19th-century French art? On what basis should we evaluate avant-garde practice? This class will focus on the period from the 1860s to 1900, considering not only the avant-garde painting movements typically called Impressionism and Post-Impressionism but also the broader visual culture of late 19th-century France. Thus the course will consider primitivism as well as the impact of technological transformation, mass production, universal exhibitions, and reproductive technologies such as photography and the illustrated press.This is a rich and fascinating period of art-making as well as cultural and technological transformation. This class will necessarily focus on the case-studies that I find most illuminating: for instance, the painters Manet, Degas, Cassatt, Seurat, Vuillard and Toulouse-Lautrec, the sculptor Carpeaux, Bartholdi's construction of the Statue of Liberty in Paris, the Eiffel Tower and the Universal Exhibitions of 1889 and 1900. But many artists and much art will not be covered as extensively as some deserve, including perhaps some of your favorites, for example, Cezanne, Van Gogh, and Renoir. What will receive more extensive consideration than usual are new technologies, including photography, photosculpture, industrial construction, and mass entertainment such as wax museums.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 185A | CCN: 04988   | 4 Units

  MW 4-530P, 106 MOFFITTThis lecture course examines art, architecture, and design from the time of the American Revolution up through the present. We will define American art as inclusive of canonical paintings, sculpture, and architecture, but also of lesser-known - though no less significant - vernacular artforms, including quilts, hide paintings, and street art. By including works made by artists and artisans previously left out of the canon, including working-class men, women, Native Americans, African Americans, and Latinos, our understanding of the history of American art will more accurately reflect the breadth of American history. Each lecture will be organized around a set of objects that can be grouped together based on their style, their subject matter, or their maker's background. This format will permit an in-depth analysis of how the imagery, design, and construction of particular objects transcended the maker's circumstances and spoke to deeper issues, including those of identity, memory, and belonging. The course's chronological organization will enable us to see how artists from varied backgrounds responded differently to the period's dramatic social, technological, scientific, and cultural changes.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 187AC | CCN: 05036   | 4 Units

  MWF 10-11A, 102 MOFFITTThe Western Hemisphere was a setting for outstanding accomplishments in the visual arts for millennia before the arrival of Europeans in the “New World.” This course presents the indigenous artistic traditions of what is now Latin America, from the earliest monuments of the formative periods (e.g. Olmec and Chavín), through acclaimed eras of aesthetic and technological achievement (e.g. Maya and Moche), to the later Inca and Mexica (i.e. Aztec) imperial periods. Our subject will encompass diverse genre including painting and sculpture, textiles and metalwork, architecture and performance. Attention will focus on the two cultural areas that traditionally have received the most attention from researchers: Mesoamerica (including what is today Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras) and the central Andes (modern Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador). We will also critique the drawing of those boundaries—both spatial and temporal—that define Pre-Columbian art and culture. More than a recitation of periods, styles, and monuments, we will assess the varieties of evidence available for interpretations of artworks that were created—for the most part—in settings without written texts. Weekly sections will allow for in-depth discussion of readings and lectures, as well as consideration of colonial and modern legacies of Pre-Columbian art and culture.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192F | CCN: 05068   | 4 Units

  M 330-630P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThe course introduces aspects of queer visual culture in the Euro-American tradition, with emphasis on the period from the Enlightenment (late eighteenth century) to the present day.  An introductory unit presents the “classical basis” of modern representations of male and female homoeroticism: how modern gay/lesbian and other non-standard sexual subcultures used imagery from the GrecoRoman world to represent possibilities of homoerotic sociability in the modern world.  The remainder of the course deals with visual and material culture from the mid-eighteenth century in Europe and North America to the present day.  Particular bodies of material have been chosen in order to emphasize different aspects of the rich array of evidence: different periods; different media; different countries; different social levels; and different kinds of gender, sexual, ethnic, and racial identification.  The course tries to balance the presentist or contemporary orientation of much queer cultural analysis, which concentrates on the past forty years in First World countries, with an historical examination of past cultural histories.  It places equal emphasis on the “high” or “fine” arts and popular or mass visual culture.  In a research project, students will explore a tradition or body of evidence in depth.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190C | CCN: 05012   | 4 Units

Connecting the Islamic empire in the East and forging links of trade and cultural exchange with Europe to the West, cities such as Cordoba captured the imagination of contemporary chroniclers, earning descriptions in the sources as truly "first-rate places". Through an exploration of the historical, literary, artistic, architectural, urban, social and economic contexts, this course will engage with and expand upon current understandings of this seminal period in Islamic history in an attempt to understand the role that Islam played in Europe and the Mediterranean world. This is in addition to an examination of the modes of cultural exchange within the region that occurred during this period both within Europe and the Islamic empire.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192B | CCN: 05051   | 4 Units

    
  M 3-6P, 115 KROEBERThe year 2014 marks the 2000 anniversary of the death of the first emperor of Rome, Augustus.  Even before his death, Augustus was the subject of a great number of commemorative monuments and memorials in a variety of genres such as statuary, coinage, inscriptions, marble freezes, (lost) paintings, honorific poems and diplomatic, honorific communications. He profoundly re-shaped the Roman world politically, geographically, governmentally, religiously, and artistically. Paul Zanker’s thesis in The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus argues that Augustus Reid built downtown Rome in his own vision to demonstrate Rome’s power and prestige as the capital of a world Empire.The course will be structured as a series of topics which build on each other. Each will focus on a particular work or topic from Augustus’ life. We will examine the ancient evidence (the buildings themselves and representations of them in art and literature) as well as a diversity of current interpretations.

Here we will consider arts within political regimes; politics of display, and politics of gender using visual examples from China, Mongolia, Japan, and Korea. The first part of the course will discuss the issues of Western technology and Asian aesthetics, culture and politics based on well-known works as Yan’an by Fu Baoshi, Mother by G.Sosai, and TV Buddha series by Nam June Paik. We will then discuss representations and questions of (how to) be in a global in Asian art today. Here we will learn about works and ideas presented by Gu Wenda, Xu Bing, and Enkhbold as well as writings by Wu Hung, Ian Findley-Brown, and John Clark. We will proceed to looking at female arists, Yayoi Kusama and Mugi, among others, discussing how and if Western theories of feminism can be applied to Asian works. A particular attention will be given to recent feminist exhibitions as Global Feminisms (2007) with contribution by Linda Nochlin, and a recent international exhibition Women In-Between: Asian Women Artists 1984-2012 organized by Fukuoka Asian Art Museum in Japan (2013).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192D.1 | CCN: 05057   | 4 Units

    Jessica Maxwell, 
  Th 9-12P, 425 DOE LIBRARYIn an effort to articulate his own procedure for creative quotation, artist Glenn Ligon once recited Jasper Johns’ famous sketchbook note: “Take an object. Do something to it. Do something else to it.” These influential instructions begin to describe the defining operations of ‘appropriation’—an artistic practice in which found objects or images are withdrawn from their known contexts and revalued in the course of their manipulation and displacement into others. Rather than provide a comprehensive overview of appropriation as an art-historical category, this seminar will narrow its interpretative aperture on the specific practices of three contemporary multi-media artists—Glenn Ligon, William Pope.L and Ellen Gallagher. This trio of artists represents three key strategies of appropriation: pastiche, détournement, and recombination. Homing in on the critical bodies of literature that have amassed around their respective bodies of work, this seminar will explore the myriad ways in which these artists reinvent found texts, commodities and ephemera and endow them with new significances that redefine traditional categories of class, gender, and race.

Class sessions will consider works ranging from monumental sculptures and murals to performances and ephemeral expression, focusing on how various audiences have understood, valued, and contested the “use” of art in their public lives. Through readings, discussions and visits to sites around the Bay Area, we will investigate how place and community might instantiated in, formulated through, or defamiliarized by artworks. We will also conduct hands-on sessions on commissioning processes, funding models, public critique, education and maintenance.

  W 2-5P, 341 STARR LIBA strong current of books and essays in recent years has brought into fuller view modern formations of art institutions, policies, histories, and aesthetics in Japan in relationship to global flows/conflicts. The time is ripe for reading into this literature to probe historiographical/methodological questions and take stock of interpretive positions on the making of “Japanese art” and its modern institutions/systems. Who was creating art history in Japan, how, and where during the late 19th-early 20th century? How did museums come into being in Japan in relationship to modernity, architecture, and empire? How were the categories of “Japanese” and “East Asian” (Tōyō) art and architecture created and deployed for domestic/global audiences? What roles did the Worlds Fairs play? How were orientalism and colonialism operating in the visual arts and spaces in Japan and globally? In light of these histories, what do we make of present-day art history work on Japan?  Rather than a survey of “modern Japanese art” or chronological/thematic sequence of artists, schools, and styles, our work will be mainly to take up the institutional, spatial, linguistic, collecting, and colonial/imperial dimensions of art (old, new) and Japan through proposals in: Satō, Modern Japanese Art and the Meiji State: The Politics of Beauty (2011). Zheng, Japan’s Imperial Museums: Architecture and the Art of the Nation (2008). “Beyond Tenshin: Okakura Kakuzō’s Multiple Legacies,” Review of Japanese Culture and Society (2012). Pai, Heritage Management in Korea and Japan: The Politics of Antiquity and Identity (2013). Guth, Art, Tea, and Industry: Masuda Takashi and the Mitsui Circle (1993).  We may also work into modern painting and aesthetics, drawing from: Victoria Weston, Japanese Painting and National Identity: Okakura Tenshin and His Circle (2004); Bert Winther-Tamaki, Maximum Embodiment: Yoga, the Western Painting of Japan, 1912-1955 (2012); Michael Marra, ed. Japanese Hermeneutics: Current Debates on Aesthetics and Interpretation (2002). Time permitting we will turn to the decades prior to/during the Asia-Pacific War and Asato Ikeda et al., ed. Art and War in Japan and its Empire, 1931-1960 (Brill, 2013) and Alan Tansman, The Aesthetics of Japanese Fascism (2009).This is an exploratory, reading heavy seminar. Discussion will be participant driven. May be taken for 4 or 2 units (the former requiring a research essay). No knowledge of the Japanese language is required. Graduate students need not be specialists in Asian studies fields. Advanced undergraduates with prior course work in Japanese studies and/or art history may apply to participate with a brief explanation of interest and the course’s relevance to major area(s).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 263 | CCN: 05143   | 4 Units

  M 10-1P, 308B DOE LIBRARYMimesis, Greek for "imitation" has become a key term in recent debates in a number of disciplines. However, what is at its core is often astonishingly undefined, open and ambivalent.  Important theories of Mimesis have been articulated in the 20th century by Auerbach, Benjamin, Caillois, Damisch, Genette, Girard, Taussig and others. In this course we will discuss a range of medieval and early modern images and texts in order to understand pre-modern reflections regarding mimesis – as well as in 20th century. Starting with antique and medieval works addressing key moments of mimesis we will also explore modern theories of mimesis. Crossing the threshold between pre-modern and modern examples will help us to understand the premises for the visual culture involving the rise of naturalism, and more generally the nature of representation in medieval and early modern culture. Topics that will be touched on in the course will include medieval, renaissance and early modern visual culture as well as visual and literal exegesis.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 291 | CCN: 05147   | 4 Units

  F 9-12P, 308B DOE LIBRARY* Also listed as Classics 270/AHMA 210 *From earliest times the Bay of Naples was home to a series of important Greek settlements —Cumae, Parthenope, Neapolis; and in the late Republic this part of Italy came to enjoy a fabulous prosperity as the site of Rome’s most important port, Puteoli. During these years Baiae, located right on the water beside Puteoli, became the playground of Rome’s rich and famous; and in 31 BC Agrippa also situated the main naval base of the Mediterranean Roman fleet there, at Misenum. By then the entire coastline south of Naples, embracing Herculaneum, Oplontis, Pompeii, Stabiae, and Surrentum, had become a resort area—a sort of Roman Côte d’Azur; and a host of luxury villas were constructed here at almost every conceivable location, even dotting the steep slopes of mount Vesuvius.The ancient sources show clearly that during this time Naples and its inhabitants retained their distinctive Greek character. The language spoken there continued to be Greek, which was (for the most part) the language of the city’s inscriptions too. Naples was the closest Greek city to Rome and relatively easy to reach; so the Roman elite flocked to it and its environs to indulge in a more relaxed and flamboyant Hellenic lifestyle than could safely be managed in Rome itself. This seminar will consider the Greek artistic heritage of the Bay of Naples under Roman patronage. Including a two-week visit to the area, and focusing on specific buildings and artworks discovered there, we shall attempt to rediscover the special flavor of this part of the Italian peninsula during its heyday in the late Republic and early Empire.Interested students should provide a paragraph explaining their interest, and how participation in the travel seminar might contribute to their educational goals.  Please detail any previous experience with Greek and/or Roman art and archaeology.

-->Room share: Classics 172This course is an introductory overview of the ancient civilizations of the Bronze Age (3000-1100 BCE) Aegean: Crete, the Cyclades, Mainland Greece, and Western Anatolia. It is intended to expose you to the sites, monuments, art, and artifacts of these cultures and to understand the way a variety of evidence is used to reconstruct history. The evocative, yet still enigmatic remains of palaces and funerary complexes, frescoes and vase-paintings, and precious worked objects will be closely examined in terms of their forms and cultural contexts. Emphasis will also be placed on comparison of the cultures and their material evidence to see how each evolved, to define similarities and differences, and most importantly, to examine the possible influence from cultural exchange, including the place of prehistoric Greece in the international world of the eastern Mediterranean.The golden age of kings and heroes, about whom Greek poets like Homer sang, seemed all but lost in the mists of time until the spades of Heinrich Schliemann and Arthur Evans began uncovering the vast palaces at Mycenae and Knossos at the end of the nineteenth century. Since then, the quantity of excavated remains has grown enormously, revealing over 2000 years of sophisticated and wealthy early civilizations.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 24 | CCN: 04894   | 1 Units

  Th 2-4P,The seminar will meet on the following dates:  1/23, 1/30, 2/6, 2/20, 2/27, 3/6 and 4/3/14. More information about Freshman Seminars can be found here: http://fss.berkeley.edu/Pictures are often taken to be a universal language available to diverse linguistic communities. We assume that two stick figures painted on a sheet of metal warns drivers, regardless of their cultural knowledge or language, that a school is nearby. However, such “reading” of pictures is based on learning a visual language and its conventions. Assuming that pictures are universal signs can lead to mistranslations and the production of new meanings. This seminar will examine the transmission and exchange of pictures during a major period of cultural convergence, European intervention in the Americas and Asia during the sixteenth century. The French, Dutch and English who interacted with non-European peoples made assumptions about the universality of visual communication and left pictorial records in prints. The Spanish who conquered Mexico encountered complex societies with sophisticated pictorial traditions. The survival of the glyphic traditions in copies of Mexican codices and post-Conquest documents entailed the (mis)translation and convergence of European and indigenous pictorial conventions. Participants in the seminar will work with materials in the collection of the Bancroft Library. Several seminar meetings will take place in the Bancroft Library, where we will discuss readings and examine materials in the collection. Each member will select an illustrated book or other object, such as a map or a print, in consultation with the instructor, conduct research and present a short, exploratory final paper to the group. The group will pool together their diverse linguistic and visual capacities.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 108.2 | CCN: 14635   | 4 Units

  MTuWTh 12-2P, 155 KROEBER This course focuses on the visual and material cultures produced in and around the Chinese capital Beijing from the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) to the present.  While Beijing has served as the political center of China for much of the last 1000 years, it has been equally important as a center of culture and the arts.  Throughout this course, we will look at a wide range of topics and objects: some public and iconic (the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Yuanming Yuan, the Olympic Park), others small and intimate (literati paintings, ivory and lacquer carvings, imperial ceramics, photographs), and anything in-between (temple murals, gardens, propaganda posters, films).  Major patrons and artists from the city like the Qianlong emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi, and Ai Weiwei will also be examined.  Through in-depth studies of specific objects, sites, or people, students will gain a solid understanding of Beijing’s role and contribution to the history of Chinese art.Readings will consist mostly of works by major scholars from China and the United States (Wu Hung, Craig Clunas, Patricia Berger, Yang Boda, Nie Chongzheng, etc.), but they will be heavily supplemented with excerpts of primary sources taken from the travels of Marco Polo, short fictions by Lao She, interviews given by Ai Weiwei, and others.Knowledge of Chinese is not required.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA N182 | CCN: 14645   | 3 Units

  MTuWTh 10-12P, 155 KROEBERThis course is an introduction to the history of photography from its origins in the early nineteenth century to the present. While this course is structured chronologically, we will be thinking about photography thematically and conceptually, asking questions and raising issues that pertain to the medium and its history as a whole. We will engage with the many uses—political, scientific, commercial, and artistic—that photography has been put to during its relatively short history, as well as with the staggering diversity of photographic technologies. Some sample topics might include: photography’s pre-history and simultaneous invention(s); the photograph as document; photography and trauma; photography’s subversive potential; photography in/of California; and the ubiquity of photography in today’s age of social networks and selfies. The case studies will focus on photographic works held in Bay Area collections. If, as the avant-garde photographer Lazlo Moholy-Nagy has written, “The illiterate of the future will be ignorant of the camera and the pen alike,” our goal in this course will be to develop our powers of visual analysis as well as description and argumentation. Readings will include both primary sources (artists’ and photographers’ statements) and essays by historians and theorists of photography (an average of 30-40 pages weekly). There will be short weekly reading responses and two longer essays, as well as creative assignments and quizzes. This is an introductory course with no pre-requisites; however, the desire to engage closely with images as well as complex theoretical readings (i.e. to spend a lot of time reading, re-reading, and analyzing the assigned texts) and willingness to participate in class are essential to success in this course.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 131B | CCN: 04925   | 4 Units

Topics will include, among others, scholar painting and theories of representation, the issue of amateur vs. professional artists, women painters, the relationship of painting to poetry and calligraphy, the political valances of painting, and Chinese practices of connoisseurship and collecting. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 203 | CCN: 05153   | 2-4 Units

We will consider the variety of ways and contexts in which objects have been understood to 'speak' as aesthetic vehicles and as cultural texts. Taught by two faculty members who have extensive experience as museum curators--one of American Art, the other of Asian Art, this class will combine theory with hands-on learning.

  M 2-5P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThis course proposes that recent art objects and artistic actions have helped catalyze and shape advanced feminist and queer thought, and asks how recent practices in the visual arts have been understood within theories about desire, activism, affect, loss, and world-making. What happens when we understand art as an active producer of theory, rather than as an object to which theory might be “applied?” We will focus our efforts around a series of case studies to think about how feminist and queer knowledge is embodied and performed within works, acts, and objects themselves. Artists/artist’s groups might include Hélio Oiticica, Yvonne Rainer, Gran Fury, Félix González-Torres, Asco, Kara Walker, Yasumasa Morimura, Zanele Muholi, and others.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190H | CCN: 05033   | 4 Units

  MWF 11-12P, 106 MOFFITTIn 1971, UC Irvine graduate Chris Burden was shot in the arm with a gun in front of a small audience; this act has become a classic in the history of performance art. How might we understand this gesture of physical violence as art? And what does it mean to "perform" art rather than to make a physical object (such as a painting or sculpture)? This lecture course provides an overview of such acts in the 20th century, starting with experimental Futurist theater and ending with contemporary works that are performed both in and out of the art institution. Among other topics, we will examine the ethics of audience participation, the uncertain status of documentation, the critical use of the body by feminist and queer artists, and the political possibilities of liveness. While we will look at examples from around the globe (particularly Asia and Latin America), special emphasis will also be given to California as an important catalyst for performance art. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 185A | CCN: 05000   | 4 Units

Issues include patronage, audience, technology, and the education of the artist as well as style, cultural expression, and the relationship of "high" art to vernacular and popular art.

The lectures will survey 2500 years of Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Medieval art and architecture both chronologically and thematically. Participants will learn to acquire the perceptual, historical, and critical skills necessary to analyze, understand, and interpret the artworks in their historical and social/political contexts. Sections taught by graduate student instructors will discuss and analyze selected artworks in greater depth, and allow students to develop their own historical, perceptual, and critical skills.

    Elizabeth Honig, 
  MWF 10-11A, 106 MOFFITTIn 1566, the great iconoclasm in the Netherlands signaled the revolt of a modern, middle-class, trade-based polity against its distant Catholic monarch, the King of Spain. In the previous 150 years, the Netherlands had undergone remarkably rapid social, religious, and economic changes, as had the aesthetics and artistic practices that registered and reflected this society.  This course will first trace the development of a complexly “realistic” aesthetic allied with symbolic content in the service of spirituality and devotional practices, developing alongside art that valued magnificence and grandiose display. We will then consider the long trajectory of these pictorial practices as the Netherlands entered the Early Modern era–the rise of merchant capitalism, the encounter with new worlds, the spiritual crisis of the Reformation.  Issues to be dealt with will include:  traditions of workshop production and new methods of marketing art; visual products for the elite and their relation to popular culture; the spread of art to the rising middle class; ideas of satire and paradox; artistic responses to cultural constructs of class and gender; the rise of genres (landscape, portraiture, still life) and their aesthetic and social functions.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 200 | CCN: 05150   | 4 Units

    Elizabeth Honig, 
  W 2-5P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThe purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the way in which art history developed from the late 19th through the late 20th century, and to allow them to frame art history’s current practices with that development in mind.  We will proceed chronologically, reading critical texts and also historicizing them, thinking about what concerns were formulated and addressed at what historical moments, how the writing of art history is always of its moment in a way we may (or may not) want to describe as “political.” I have tried to select readings that are both fundamental to the shaping of our discipline and in some way “typical” of their time, although certain texts really fall only into one or the other category. By the end of the semester, students should be able to think critically about art history writing and, eventually, about their own place in the field. Authors we  read may include Hildebrand, Berenson, Wölfflin, Riegl, Warburg, Freud, Panofsky, Fry, Sedlmayr, Benjamin, Greenberg, Schapiro, Van Gulik, Gombrich, Kubler, Fried, Venturi, Clark, Baxandall, Damisch, Nochlin, Mulvey, Kristeva, Pollock, Barthes, Alpers, Koerner, Clunas, Gruzinski.

  TuTh 1230-2P, 106 MOFFITTThis course introduces the study of Buddhist icons in Japan within broader visual cultures in Asia. We will consider exemplary and unusual images of the Buddha and other deities; miraculous and secret icons; iconotexts and relics; and art historical praxis. What are we to make, for instance, of legends that claim that the first image of the Buddha Śākyamuni carved during his lifetime in South Asia, resides in Japan? What about speaking and moving statues? Why are sculptures “stuffed” with texts and other items? How are Buddhist teachings represented, and what benefits accrue to practitioners who encounter, view, and make offerings to icons? What drives the replication of particular iconic forms; why might deities shape/identity-shift? What is the “modern gaze,” and how does it change what we see when we look at Buddhist icons? There is no pre-requisite for this class (such as HA134A), but you should be prepared to read, think, and write at an advanced level.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 375 | CCN: 05249   | 2 Units

  M 10-1P, 425 DOE LIBRARYInstructor approval required. This seminar satisfies a University-wide requirement that all first-time Graduate Student Instructors take a pedagogy course. It can be taken concurrently with a first teaching assignment or in the semester before beginning teaching. The class will encourage you to think in larger terms about the function of pedagogy in art history–what we learn, what we teach, who we are as teachers in this field. You should learn how to lead a good section and how to grade exams effectively, but also how to help students think and write in visual terms, how to guide them to a more critical mode of reading, how to direct them in independent research, and how to ensure that they work to the best of their potential.
Beyond that, this class is a pre-professional workshop, designed to help you plan what your teaching will be like when you are designing and instructing courses on your own. Throughout the semester you will be thinking about a class that you would like to teach some day in your field. You will make up paper assignments and exams for that class, and eventually you will draft a syllabus and part of your first lecture for that class. Your final project will be a “teaching portfolio” which will incorporate your syllabus, assignments, and a “teaching statement” explaining your personal philosophy of teaching. We will also be talking about the job market, interviewing, and job talks.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190T / Rhet 136 | CCN: 05321   | 4 Units

  MWF 1-2P, 102 MOFFITTThe course surveys critical controversies surrounding fakes, forgeries, multiples, counterfeits, imitations, and appropriations from the Late Renaissance to the present day, in European, American, Australian and Chinese art. Each of the images and objects we will examine sparked extensive debate in art history, philosophy, anthropology, social theory or legal studies, around which we will build our own discussions. Through a series of historical case studies, we will track how copies are excised—and sometimes reinstated—into the status of art, and delve into the impact of the copy on the rhetorics of authorship, genius, individuality, expertise and technology. We will be reading  theoretical texts on copies in various historical and cultural contexts, with an eye towards learning the various disciplinary methods that have been taken up to define and evaluate them. Two writing assignments and a final research paper are designed to develop our awareness to the rhetorics of visual and material analysis, and of historical narratives of invention, imitation and appropriation.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 170 | CCN: 04976   | 4 Units

  TuTh 2-330P, 102 MOFFITT“Baroque” is an all-encompassing term that has been used to describe an amazing number of seventeenth-century artists and architects: Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi, Bernini, Poussin, and Velázquez to name a few. Rather than trying to convince you that they are in some way similar because they lived in the same era or that we can attribute their respective differences to individual genius, this course will approach the ways that meaningful art is the product of conflicting demands, failures and triumphs, personal initiatives and accidents in the face of social and historical pressures. While students will be introduced to the works of art produced by a select group of individuals from roughly 1590-1670, our focus will be on Rome as an extremely vital cosmopolitan center that was the site of a confluence of artists from all over Europe, an emergent, competitive art market and the spectacular architectural and sculptural patronage of the Roman Catholic church. Rome will be treated as the setting for the careers of seventeenth-century artists who made the city the way it appears today and shaped the direction of art in the modern era. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 30 | CCN: 04892   | 4 Units

  TuTh 930-11A, 106 MOFFITTSouth Asia brings to mind conflicting images of the glamour of Bollywood and abject poverty. Yet, this vast geographic terrain has a long history of complex political cultures, multivalent religious ideals, and diverse creative expressions. Our engagement with the visual cultures of Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka from ca. 2500 BCE to the colonial times will allow us to unpack the complexities that constitute South Asia. Proceeding in a chronological order, we will engage with key moments of artistic production. We will locate visual practices within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations. Tracing intrepid exchanges between Rome and South Asia in the early common era, early modern collaborations between South Asia, Iran, and Turkey, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism, we will also attend to the capacious cultural ambits of global art. Simultaneously, visits to museums and Hindu temples in Berkeley will allow us to understand South Asian visual culture in the Bay Area. Our aim will be to generate the depth and context required for understanding contemporary South Asia through a historical frame while developing a critical methodology to engage with vision and visuality in an expanded global field. No previous knowledge of South Asian history or art history is required.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 290.3 | CCN: 05168   | 2-4 Units

  Tu 5-8P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThis seminar investigates the relations between formalist procedures, aestheticist philosophies, and erotic investments in art-writing from the eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. How did major modern art-writers deal with the erotic and sexual content of artworks in the past and the present, Western and non-Western? In what ways did art-writing function as a medium of critical commentary on modern sexualities? Why did certain artists and particular artworks emerge as the special focus of erotically invested art-writing? What were the interactions between art-writing concerned to address the erotic dimensions of aesthetic experience and formal theories of sexuality in such fields as biology, philosophy, psychology, and psychoanalysis? How did modern art-writing deal with nonnormative eroticisms, with pornography, and with censorship? The seminar will read influential texts (including writings by Winckelmann, Goethe, Schopenhauer, Ruskin, Pater, Symonds, Huysmans, Lee, Santayana, Berenson, Freud, Fry, and Stokes) and relevant scholarly commentary. Student projects will investigate particular traditions or cases. Readings from German and French texts will be in English translation, but students are encouraged to work on art-writing in the language of the original.

Class sessions will be organized around case studies of diverse subjects in diverse media, including Aubrey Beardsley’s erotic Art Nouveau illustration, Alfred Stieglitz’s urban photography, Marcel Duchamp’s readymades and Pablo Picasso’s cubist collage. Focused tightly on a period that reaches its climax and conclusion in the First World War, we will consider modern artists’ utopian, revolutionary, technologized and dystopian agendas. Concentrating on connections and exchange between modern art movements across the Atlantic Ocean, we will consider theories of modernism and modernity, avant-garde and popular culture, nationalism and colonialism.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 285 | CCN: 05159   | 2-4 Units

  Tu 2-5P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThis seminar will focus on critical models of place and its influence developed in the twentieth and twenty-first century – an era in which many have nostalgically lamented the demise of the local. Considering various ways we might productively position our subjects and ourselves geographically, this course will explore topics ranging from Lewis Mumford’s 1930s calls for a new mode of US regional planning to Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s recent plea to pluralize a continent in Other Asias. We will look closely at the visual arts of the United States, particularly in the mid-twentieth century, to reflect on the ways location functions in categories such as “American Scene Painting,” “New York School” or “Bay Area Figurative Style”. Examining questions of boundaries and belonging, collectivity and common sense, our readings will be drawn from diverse fields, including art history, architecture, geography, political science, international relations and diaspora studies. 
Seminar participants may choose to develop a research paper that considers the impact of our course’s themes in any area or era.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192L | CCN: 05300   | 4 Units

  W 2-5P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThis seminar will focus on the extraordinary photographs of Mexico by the French nineteenth-century photographer Désiré Charnay during his first voyage of 1857-1861. Already an experienced photographer (he took up the medium in 1853 in Paris), he photographed Maya ruins in Yucatán (Izamal, Uxmal, Chichén Itzá), Oaxaca (Mitla), and Chiapas (Palenque), which he published as the atlas to his Cités et ruines américaines in 1862. To make these photographs he had to hire locals to help transport two tons of equipment and also to hack away dense forest and undergrowth hiding the monuments. Bancroft Library holds Charnay’s photographs and we will meet in their seminar room in order to study them intensively. Among topics to be examined are the differences between graphic illustrations and photographs, the history of representations of Maya and pre-Hispanic Mexican culture and monuments, the early history of Mexican archaeology, illustrated travel accounts, the colonial role of photography in the nineteenth-century, archaeology’s reliance on different visual media, and the history of racial typologies. 
We are organizing this as an undergraduate seminar, but encourage interested graduate students to enroll.

  W 2-3P, 141 GIANNINIIn this course we explore the intersections of art and science in medieval, modern, and contemporary history. Our aim is twofold. First, to show the close interaction between these two fields, and of the way in which historically they have shaped each other. Leonardo, Galileo, Darwin and Einstein acted at the threshold between these two fields. Second, to turn specific instances of art/science interaction into the prism through which one can reach a fuller understanding of major historical transformations. Gutenberg and Leonardo will be the pivotal Renaissance figures, while the rise of Newtonian science and the Romantic revolution will guide us into the contemporary experience of the art/science interaction, up to the current transformation of both fields through computing and digital media. The course takes the form of a longue-durée overview that spans from the awakening of European culture through the reception of new knowledge from the Near East to the most recent encounters between artistic and scientific practice in the 21st century.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 88 | CCN: 05303   | 4 Units

  TBAAn introduction to the arts and visual culture of what is now Latin America from the earliest monumental art traditions of prehistory to the present. This course is not a comprehensive survey of all traditions and movements of art and image making in Latin America, but rather a sampling of critical moments and monuments that is designed to serve as an introduction to this field of study. We will take a long view of enduring traditions as well as periods of rupture and crisis.

  Tu 2-5P, 425 DOE LIBRARYAlthough it was the era in which, for the very first time, writings on (religious) art were published in the Netherlands (both in Latin and the vernacular), the Iconoclastic era (1566-1585) has rarely drawn the attention of art historians. Yet, interesting theories on (religious) art that might have been more influential than we have thus far recognized were developed in this fascinating era of Reformation, early Counter-Reformation and Revolt. In this course we will investigate how and why the wide-spread images debates emerging shortly before and just after the Iconoclasm of 1566 must be considered an important catalyst for the emergence of Baroque art and art theory in the Netherlands - the art of Peter Paul Rubens especially.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  192M | CCN: 05345   | 4 Units

  W 9-12P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThis seminar explores surrealist ideas and practices and their legacy in the visual arts of the global twentieth century. We will take advantage of a recent proliferation of documentary studies of surrealism outside the West to consider a wide distribution of historical cases: works in France in the 1920s, in Mexico, Egypt, and Serbia in the 1930s, in Martinique, Japan, and Syria in the 1940s, and beyond into pop culture in the 1950s and 1960s. By this expanded archive of surrealist practice, we will engage with theories of representation, desire, critique, and aesthetic revolution. We will also think through methodological problems related to circulation and reception, both mapping the transnational networks of publication, exhibition, and political activism that affiliated farflung surrealist artists to one another, and exploring the possibility that the transmission and visual translation of surrealist ideas followed routes other than mappable, directional models of influence.

  MW 4-530P, 102 MOFFITT The Italian Renaissance is often considered to be the beginning of modernity. This is because the Renaissance is the first coherent articulation of a number of ideas--from the role of the individual within society to the rise of capitalism-- that are closely associated with notions of "modern". In this interdisciplinary course, we will discuss the various aspects of Renaissance life and culture that made this era both distinct within and formative for the history of western society. We will focus primarily on art, literature and political philosophy to draw a picture of the major cultural forces shaping the Renaissance. You will encounter many famous figures, including Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Machiavelli, placing these within their social and historical context. Where possible, the readings will be from the Renaissance itself, either writings of the authors, poets and artists we are studying, or the words of contemporaries writing about them.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 298 | CCN: 05209   | 2 Units

    
  W 530-730P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThis seminar will begin on Wed 9/24 and end on Wed 10/22.“Money,” T. J. Clark has written, “is the root form of representation in bourgeois society.”  The proposition turns on the set of questions it raises, about markets and money flows, about value and its abstraction, about whom money belongs to, about the “social reality of the Sign” and the effect money has on artmaking.  Money, by the statement’s end, becomes a central form – maybe the central form – of modern life.  Over the last 15 years – the sentence comes from Farewell to an Idea – the urgency of these questions has only intensified, obliging us, in turn, to confront them anew, to ask them anew.  This 5-week seminar, offered in conjunction with the conference Modern Money: Aesthetics after the Gold Standard (October 23-24, 2014), provides a space in which to begin that process.  “Money” will be construed in a broad sense, as cash and coin but also as such derivative things as pawnshop tickets, stock certificates, and advertising copy – money, as it were, not only as currency and commodity, as medium of exchange, but also, and perhaps fundamentally, as a form constituted by the social relations of credit and debt.  The seminar, then, has two interrelated goals, two interrelated projects: on the one hand, to account for the various shapes – the various looks – the money-form has taken in the modern period and, on the other, to reassess the effect money, as root form of representation, has on our dealings with art and aesthetics. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 62 | CCN: 04869   | 4 Units

    Gregory Levine, 
  W 2-5P, 308B DOE LIBRARYWhat is eco-art history or, perhaps, eco-critical art historical inquiry? I take it that it has to be more than resource conservation, driving an electric vehicle, and so forth, and one might start with questions such as the following. How does one study and interpret the visual-material past in an ecological manner—what would that manner require? What sort of values and methods would art history need to assert and employ to be ecologically engaged or consistent methodologically, philosophically, and politically with, for instance, Deep Ecology or “biospheric egalitarianism”? What, meanwhile, is ecology, and how do we conceptualize, create, and actualize ecological humanities knowledge? How might eco-art history diverge from eco-criticism in literary study? General topics that come to mind include: art and industrialization; environmental degradation, climate change, and salvage archaeology; eremitism, romanticism, and transcendentalism and art; contemporary creative work and eco-activism; aesthetics, capitalism, and landscape; historiography and methodology in art history and visual culture studies; and so forth. What might the limitations or pitfalls be of an ecological turn in art history; is “eco-art history” perhaps oxymoronic, is it burdened by a potentially naïve politics?

These questions may or may not be productive starting points, and thus the first task of the seminar group will be to define the problems at hand; propose questions and topics for investigation; identify fertile literatures, objects, and sites; and engage specialists in relevant disciplines across campus. Given the literatures on ecology, art history, as well as eco-critical literary studies, we will hardly be starting from scratch. But I do wonder what art history would look like, and look at, were it to turn (actually it is already turning, to judge from a few publications and recent panels and lectures) toward ecological values and methods.

Students will contribute to collaborative development of this seminar, with attention to their individual fields of study, prepare weekly critical responses and presentations, and (for 4 units) complete a contained object/site-focused research project and formal written essay (which may incorporate non-written, multiple media components, materials as pertinent). The seminar may be taken for 2 units. Advanced undergraduates with prior course work in art history may apply to participate with a brief explanation of interest and the course’s relevance to major area(s). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190M | CCN: 05100   | 4 Units

  TuTh 330-5P, 102 MOFFITTUpper Division Lecture: D) Middle East/Africa; III) 1800-present. This lecture course explores the images, objects, and spaces of a century of efforts to make art and visual culture modern - often radically so - in the geopolitical territory called the ‘Middle East.’ We begin by investigating the history of technological transformation in the nineteenth century as it impacted visual culture and artistic practice in the Ottoman Empire, the Persian Empire under the Qajar dynasty, and France and its colonial acquisitions. We will also scrutinize competing conceptualizations of civilizational difference between East and West, as gave rise to comparative approaches in the study of aesthetics and ornament as well as to artistic strategies within movements such as expressionism, primitivism, and formal abstraction. Throughout, we consider debates about industrial modernization, the spirit and spiritualism, and material heritage that gave impetus to artistic and architectural production in (and about) the Middle East. We conclude by examining how these art historical themes of likeness and difference could also be mobilized politically in the national artistic movements that emerged in force in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, when artists working in capital cities such as Istanbul, Cairo, and Baghdad began to reclaim notions of Eastern alterity as a substrate for national solidarities. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192F | CCN: 05124   | 4 Units

This course explores the profound effect of evolutionary theory on modern art in Europe and the United States. Artists explored new ideas about sexual selection, the struggle for existence, the relationship between humans and animals, the expression of the emotions, metamorphosis in nature, and the purpose of beauty. Classes will focus on diverse case studies including Frederick Church’s landscape paintings, Odilon Redon’s symbolist prints, Louis Sullivan’s architectural ornament, and Gustav Klimt’s art nouveau decoration. During the semester we will consider the theories of evolutionists such as Charles Darwin and discuss questions of aesthetics, race, colonialism, gender, and sexuality. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190G | CCN: 05097   | 4 Units

  MWF 11-12P, 201 GIANNINIUpper Division Lecture: C) Americas; III) 1800-present. This course takes as its subject the U. C. Berkeley campus as a product of many disparate visions about the nature of the institution and the role of the built environment in instruction and in envisioning a landscape of learning.  Our emphasis will be on the core campus buildings, those built between 1880-1930, and especially those designed by John Galen Howard, Bernard Maybeck, and Julia Morgan.  Each student will become expert on several buildings, and will serve as guide for a public campus architectural tour scheduled for April.  In the final weeks of the course we will look at the additions and changes to the campus that occurred between 1930 and the present.  There are no prerequisites although some knowledge of architecture will be useful.  Students interested in taking this course should put themselves on the waitlist and send a few sentences about yourself, your interest, and your preparation to: mmlovell@berkeley.edu Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 100 | CCN: 05034   | 4 Units

    Whitney Davis, 
  MW 4-530P, 102 MOFFITTThis course is required of undergraduate majors in History of Art, but it is also open to other interested students. It reviews some of the principal methods of art historical analysis and theories of art history, including connoisseurship, “formalism,” iconography and iconology, cultural and social history, and gender and race studies, in relation to relevant developments in art and aesthetics and in philosophy, archaeology, literary studies, sociology, and other fields. Attention will also be paid to the institutional and professional formation of art history and to the kinds of careers art historians can have today. The approach is roughly chronological, beginning with “foundational” documents of art-historical aesthetics in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and ending with present-day postcolonial interculturalist art history, “world art studies,” and “thing theory.” Examples are drawn from art-historical practice in ancient, medieval, and modern studies and from Western and non-Western contexts, though the emphasis is placed on methods and theories developed in the Euro-American tradition of art history to account for histories of art on a global scale. Primary readings will be taken partly from the Oxford History of Art volume on The Art of Art History, edited by Donald Preziosi, and partly from other sources. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 290.3 | CCN: 05193   | 4 Units

  Tu 5-8P,This seminar is open to qualified undergraduates and to graduate students. It explores the historiography of the study of ancient arts and more broadly the reception of ancient arts in the disciplines of history, art history, archaeology, and anthropology and in relation to practices of collecting and exhibition (often in colonial and imperial contexts). Because these disciplines originated as academic investigations in the West (especially in German, French, and British museums and universities in the nineteenth century), it is not surprising that one of the chief topics—a focus—of ancient art studies has been the ancient art of the Western tradition, namely, the art of the Greco-Roman world in relation to its immediate historical antecedents (especially Egyptian and ancient Near Eastern arts). But ancient arts from around the world (e.g., in the pre-Columbian Americas, the circumpolar regions, and Oceania) have also been the subject of “Western” investigation, increasingly interacting with the study of these arts by scholars whose aesthetic and intellectual foundations lie outside the “West.” These developments will be considered in five thematic units: (1) Classical Naturalism and Anthropomorphism; (2) Ancient Egyptian Conceptualism; (3) The “Origins of Art”; (4) The Anthropology of “Primitive” Art; and (5) Visual Culture and Ancient Empires. Students will develop project that reflect their research interests and skills (e.g., in classical archaeology, analytic anthropology, nineteenth-century art history). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 291 | CCN: 05196   | 4 Units

  M 9-12P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThis seminar seeks to examine the urban development, art, and architecture of Istanbul, from its origins as a modest Greek colony in the seventh c. BCE to the present- day megapolis of close to 14 million people. Continuously inhabited for thousands of years and now one of the largest cities in the world, this city sitting between Europe and Asia, was in addition the capital of two vast empires, one Christian (Byzantium) and one Muslim (Ottoman). Its urban fabric, museums, buildings and archaeological remains offer a unique perspective into the arts, architecture, and urban development of thousands years of human history: Greek and Roman, Byzantine and western medieval, Ottoman, and modern and contemporary.The seminar will have two parts. In the first few weeks, the participants engage in learning in chronological fashion about the history, architecture, and arts of the city. One to two weeks each will be spent on the Ancient, Late Antique, Byzantine, Ottoman, Modern, and Contemporary periods. The readings will be organized around a specific problem, such as: Greek Colonization and Urbanism in the Mediterranean; Alexander and the spread of Hellenic Culture and Art; Building a Capital for a Christian Empire; the Byzantine Churches of Istanbul; the Christian Legacy of Ottoman Architecture; The Architect Sinan and the Making of Ottoman Architecture; Istanbul and the Arts of the Ottoman Empire; Genovese Traders and Western Artists: Istanbul in European Art, Travel Accounts, and Maps; Modernity and Tradition: Palaces on the Bosphorus; and “Raise up the Roof, Builders!”: The Gecekondu shanty towns of Istanbul.Interested students should provide a paragraph explaining their interest, suggest a research topic and how participation in the travel seminar might contribute to their educational goals. Please detail any previous experience with Istanbul, Byzantine Art, Islamic Art, Medieval Art, and Ottoman History.

  TuTh 930-11A, 102 MOFFITTUpper Division Lecture: A) Europe and Mediterranean, D) Middle East/Africa; I) prehistoric-1200. “Hellenistic” means “late Greek,” and this class is about Greek art after the classical period. Now completely restructured and revised, it covers Greek architecture, sculpture, painting, mosaic, and luxury crafts from Alexander the Great (336-323 B.C.) though Cleopatra VII of Egypt (51-30 B.C.), and the conquest of her kingdom by Rome. It spans three centuries, three continents, five major kingdoms, and countless cities, and includes some of the most thoughtful and stunning products of the ancient world. In addition to close study of many of the major works, we shall examine both their cultural context and key issues such as the arts of power and victory; portraiture and personhood; benefaction; court art and the luxury crafts; piety; erotica; difference, diversity, the abject, and the grotesque; death; and the creative artist. Whenever possible we shall include newly discovered work and will give it special attention. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192A.1 | CCN: 05115   | 2, 4 Units

    Sugata Ray, 
  Tu 11-2P, 425 DOE LIBRARYUpper Division Seminar: B) Asia, E) transcultural; II) 1200-1800. Every city feels different, sounds different, smells different, and has distinctive urban cultures. We walk, we stroll, we see. But what do we see when we walk in the city? To what extent is our perception of the city mediated by the work of individual architects and urban planners? To what extent is our perception of urbanity mediated by representations of the city in art, literature, and performative practices? This course will utilize major metropolitan centers such as Bombay, Delhi, and Jaipur to analyze how we perceive and experience urbanity, both real and metaphoric. While each of these cities generated a distinctive urban culture, they were also emblematic of wider global tendencies. Thus, diverting from conventional roadmaps, we will jaywalk in medieval and early modern urban pasts. Our examination will range from the work of specific architects and planners to art, literature, and performative practices that have emerged out of and reflect the context of the metropolis. This engagement will be complemented by key texts on early modern urbanity, colonialism and nationalism, and postcolonial theory to understand building practices, philosophical debates, and contestations over space that have produced the South Asian city. Our aim will be to develop a critical vocabulary to engage with urbanisms, representational conventions, and the global flow of ideas more broadly.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 136A | CCN: 05061   | 4 Units

Early India is a rich source of creative myths, literary texts, and visual practices that offer a glimpse into the social, cultural, and political complexities of the ancient worlds. How did the ancient city develop into a laboratory for cosmopolitan creativity and thought? How might we fathom the libidinous sexual desires of Hindu gods? How did the philosophy of yoga regulate the body? Could we produce a gendered reading of monsters and the monstrous body through a feminist lens? How might we read the transgressive masculinity of the Buddha’s body? Our examples will be drawn from the first urban formations around the river Indus in present-day India and Pakistan to art and architecture produced up to 1200 CE. We will examine aesthetic conventions, religious ideals, and urban cultures by focusing on the painting, sculpture, and architecture traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Equally important will be artistic exchanges with China, Southeast Asia, and the Roman world through the geo-politics of early empires and global trade.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192L | CCN: 05130   | 4 Units

  Tu 2-5P, 425 DOE LIBRARYUpper Division Seminar: C) Americas; II) 1200-1800. In this seminar we will delve into the texts and images of four remarkable illustrated manuscripts created during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Created by various agents—Spanish friars and indigenous authors and artists—these four bodies of work constitute some of the earliest and most important historical sources on the pre-Hispanic world, its history, and its cultural traditions. But beyond their service as chronicles, these illustrated manuscripts can be examined as contested sites for the colonial negotiation of identity, culture, politics, and faith in the early decades of Spanish America.Our corpus includes the bilingual “Florentine Codex” created in Mexico in the 1570s by Nahua writers and artists under the supervision of the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún, Martín de Murúa’s 1590 and 1613 manuscripts on the history of the Incas and Peru, and the native author and artist Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala’s 1615 “New Chronicle and Good Government,” written for Philip III in protest of Spanish colonial conditions in Peru.This seminar is open to undergraduate and graduate students. The primary requirements will be active participation in class and the development of an original research paper using facsimiles and online digitizations of these illustrated manuscripts. Spanish reading ability is recommended but not required.

  TuTh 11-1230P, A1 HEARST ANNEXLower Division Survey; western. An introduction to art and visual culture produced mainly in Europe and the United States between the fourteenth century and the present, this course will focus on broad themes explored in various artistic media and subjects. We will analyze the emergence of the modern individual in case studies ranging from the painted portraits of Renaissance donors to our own contemporary culture of photographic self-ies. Exploring the rise of modern society in urban spaces, we will examine the ways visual images and artists embraced difference, deviance and decadence, as well as the methods by which they helped maintain the social, political, and economic status quo. We will explore visual cultures of war and violence; the relationships of sexuality and power; and art’s link to realms and altered states beyond the everyday visible world.No prior knowledge of the history of art is assumed or required.  The course will teach skills of critical looking, as well as thinking, reading, and writing that are crucial to our own image-saturated age.

Class sessions will consider works ranging from monumental sculptures and murals to performances and ephemeral expression, focusing on how various audiences have understood, valued, and contested the “use” of art in their public lives. Through readings, discussions and visits to sites around the Bay Area, we will investigate how place and community might instantiated in, formulated through, or defamiliarized by artworks. We will also conduct hands-on sessions on commissioning processes, funding models, public critique, education and maintenance.

  F 10-1P, 308B DOE LIBRARYHonoré Daumier (1808-79) produced hundreds of cheap, mass-produced lithographic caricatures for the ephemeral newspaper Charivari, making him one of the consummate (Baudelairian) Modern artists. In addition, Daumier transposed his graphic facility to painting and sculpture. Yet he also used the obdurate materiality of his clay bust sculptures as models for his investigation of exaggerated anatomical features. This seminar will examine the role of different media in the corpus of this prolific artist, focusing on the politics and mechanisms of caricature. Key issues include exaggeration, humor, censorship, irony, ephemerality, reversal, reproduction, lithography (without preparatory drawing), substitution, seriality, repetition, and scale as well as physiognomy and constructions of gender, class, and racial difference.  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 290.1 | CCN: 05187   | 4 Units

  Tu 9-12P, 308B DOE LIBRARY This  seminar is devoted to interrogating the Cold War image – painted,  projected, planted, or proclaimed – in the art worlds spanning multiple  ‘fronts’ of global conflict from the end of the Second World War to the  fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The historical markers of this period  include not only tense negotiations between hegemonic blocs and proxy  wars, but also decolonization struggles dedicated to political,  economic, and cultural liberation, which prompted representatives of the  United States, the Soviet Union, China, France, East and West Germany,  Italy, and the Non-aligned Movement (Yugoslavia, India, Indonesia,  Egypt, Ghana, Cuba, and scores of other countries and groups) into  elaborate plays for a share in Third World patronage. From this crucible  emerged a new wave of art biennials, Communist youth rallies,  exhibition and performance exchanges, and increasingly dense  constellations of artists, cultural workers, public intellectuals, and  covert security agents. For some time, scholars of visual culture who  analyze these phenomena have highlighted the countervisualities of the  decolonizing struggle, contending they should be understood as  visualizations, i.e. as goals, strategies, and imagined forms of  singularity and collectivity that are not realistic, but rather produce  an extended sense of the real, the realistic, and realism(s). In this  course, we aim to bring analyses of visuality and countervisuality into  conversation with art history – particularly scholarship mobilizing  notions of parafiction, performativity, and acting ‘as if.’ Our inquiry  will proceed by attending to the extraordinary pressures exerted on the  image by transnational networks of trade, exhibition, and activism,  thereby exploring ways to write histories of images in global Cold War  conditions that maintain the contingency of the real in representation,  without demanding truth, transparent intention, or consensus. Case  studies include the export of American Abex painting, décollage in  France and Algeria, model homes in Iran, Socialist Realist painting  (including a trip to the Wende Museum in L.A.), Third World biennials,  the OSPAAAL, art commissions in Syria, and more. Readings will be drawn  from the fields of art history, political science, visual culture  studies, and critical theory.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 230/HA 192A.2 | CCN: 05178   | 4 Units

Ai Weiwei’s exhibition will be the touchstone for the seminar and we will visit Alcatraz together early in the semester to come to grips with this multipart work in its chosen setting—one of the US’s most notorious prisons (this will be a required weekend trip and will take much of a day). In class, we will turn back in time to consider the visual arts in the service of nationalist, reformist and minority rights movements from the early 20th century forward, ending with the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. Finally, we will consider China’s ongoing effort to conserve ancient monuments, expanding the concept of human rights to include the collective right of material access to the past. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192A.2/HA 230 | CCN: 05117   | 2, 4 Units

The parallel worlds of amorous art and erotic texts, at times resonating with one another, at times diverging, offer a fascinating perspective not only on notions of love and passion, but also on other important aspects of the human condition, such as the conflict between individual strives and societal norms, and the pursuit of higher realities, such as Beauty, and the divine.Weekly sessions will be dedicated to discussions of the assigned readings, and peer-review assignments. Members of the seminar are expected to produce a substantial research paper (for which they will receive ample advising) and to participate actively in class discussions.Previous coursework in ancient and/or medieval art or history is desirable. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192E | CCN: 05121   | 2, 4 Units

  W 9-12P, 425 DOE LIBRARYUndergraduate Seminar: A) Europe and Mediterranean; II) 1200-1800. This course looks at the artistic production of Pieter Bruegel as a particular window onto some of the biggest issues of Renaissance thought: the place of man in the cosmos, selfhood and self-knowledge, the relation between external appearance and internal being, human ambition and the sources of true authority, the fate of the individual in a time of perpetual warfare, and human folly and festive behavior. We will examine the types of visual language open to Bruegel – the tradition of Bosch, the alternatives introduced from renaissance Italy, local innovations in representing landscape. We will also consider the impact of humanism; of new technologies of print-making; of the new social organization being brought about by early merchant capitalism; and the unsettling of normative beliefs caused by the Reformation and global exploration. We will read primary texts by Erasmus, Rabelais, and Montaigne, and consider Bruegel as speaking visually to some of the same problems that concerned those thinkers.This course may be taken as a reading course for 2 units, or with a research component for 4 units.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA N100 | CCN: 14615   | 4 Units

  MTuWTh 10-12P, 106 MOFFITTRequired for majors in History of Art.  As an academic discipline, art history is constantly evolving.  While this fact seems rather banal and commonplace in our fast-paced, science-dominated 21st century, it points towards an important and frequently overlooked truth: as a mode of inquiry, art history itself has a history.  Taking this insight as its starting point, this course introduces the various modes, methods, theories, and paradigms that have dominated or perhaps even haunted art history during its tenure as an academic discipline.  To do so we will proceed chronologically, reading figures such as Kant, Winckelmann, Hegel, Morelli, Berenson, Wölfflin, Riegl, Panfosky, and others, all the way up to writers and theorists of today.  Ubiquitous terms such as “form” and “style” as well as notorious “ isms” such as Marxism and Structuralism will be discussed.  And all the while we will keep an eye on how the legacies of these famous thinkers and the vestiges of their now infamous ideas are still at work in the scholarship of our own moment.  Previous coursework in art history is not required but students will find it helpful to have taken at least one upper-division course in a related field. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 108 | CCN: 14620   | 4 Units

  MTuWTh 2-4P, 106 MOFFITTBeijing, with its long imperial history in northern China, and Shanghai, a relatively young port city to the south, present two contrasting cases of the complex relationship between urban spaces and the arts in China. While the northern capital’s artistic and urban development depended heavily on support by the central political power, arts in Shanghai thrived through private enterprise and patronage. Thus, we will consider the significant difference between public and private art, site-specific and portable art objects, as well as professional and amateur artists.  This course is designed to prompt students to consider the many incarnations of these two cities through a study of the visual and material cultures produced in and about the cities. We will examine historical maps, public spaces, monuments, private gardens, propaganda posters, and films in our endeavor to better understand the intrinsic relationship between art and the urban environment.Readings will consist of both primary sources (artist’s statements, letters and memoirs) and scholarly works by experts in the field of Chinese Art, Chinese History and Urban Studies (Wu Hung, Patricia Berger, Yeh Wen-hsin, Leo Lee, John Urry, and Michel de Certeau). We will conduct close readings and students will be expected to engage thoroughly with the textual and visual materials presented throughout the course. Students are expected to allot enough time in their schedules to thoroughly read and analyze assigned texts so they are ready to participate in class discussions.Knowledge of Chinese is not required.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (B) and Chronological periods (II and III).  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA N182 | CCN: 14630   | 3 Units

  MTuWTh 12-2P, 106 MOFFITTDefine photography. Go ahead.Not as evident as it seems? One of the reasons may be the staggeringly quick evolution of the technology behind the production of pictures and the multiplicity of roles these images were/are made to play. The plurality indicated in the title of this course hints at the various avenues any class on photography could take as its narrative.This course, an introduction to the history of photography, will examine technological innovation. In that sense, chronology will matter. But beyond production, we will engage with how photography has been used, thinking about it thematically and conceptually. When, why, and how is photography political, commercial, scientific, and artistic? We will learn about photography’s pre-history and simultaneous invention(s) with Niepce and Daguerre; think about the photograph as document; consider its role in times of conflict and its relation to trauma; its subversive potential; what happens when color invades the frame; and the ubiquity and instant gratification of photography in today’s age of social networks and mobile devices.This course will rely heavily on visual analysis (give those eyes a workout!), description and argumentation. Readings will include both primary sources (artists’ and photographers’ statements) and essays by historians and theorists of photography (an average of 50 pages weekly). There will be short weekly reading responses and two longer essays, as well as creative assignments.This is an introductory course with no prerequisites; however, English reading and writing skills must be developed enough to be able to meaningfully engage with images as well as complex theoretical readings. Participation in class is essential to success in this course. This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (III).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 141A | CCN: 05040   | 4 Units

    Julia Bryan-Wilson, 
  MW 4-530P, 102 MOFFITTThis lecture course provides a hemispheric overview of contemporary art—starting around 1960—with an emphasis on the contested relationship between art, audiences, and museums. We take the broadest possible definition of “American art” as we look at art spanning North, Central, and South America to think critically about the many movements and counter-movements that have emerged in countries like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States. We will consider art in times of political turmoil and dictatorship to think about fugitive image-making during times of censorship. How has art increasingly migrated beyond the walls of the gallery—into public spaces for instance, or onto the internet? We will look at practices that confront the conventional boundaries of the art object and challenge the traditional publics of art institutions. While close attention will be paid to site-specificity, activist art, feminist and queer performance, earthworks, and street interventions, we will also investigate how photography, painting, and sculpture have been reshaped by new viewers and display practices.  We will also account for the effects of globalization and itinerancy as we trace how art, artists, and viewers travel across borders (both imaginatively and literally).   Select students will participate in a hands-on curatorial project regarding Conceptual art at the Berkeley Art Museum.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (C) and Chronological period (III).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192L | CCN: 05112   | 4 Units

  Tu 10-1P, 425 DOE LIBRARYIn this seminar we will study the wall paintings of palaces, temples, and tombs from pre-Hispanic Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru with an emphasis on the early periods prior to the Aztec and Inca empires. Secondarily, we will examine colonial, modern, and contemporary legacies of indigenous painting in Latin America and the United States. Readings will come from art historical and archaeological literature, as well as critical sources on space and proxemics, the built environment, and embodiment and subjectivity. Discussion topics will include: artistic techniques and materials, iconography, text and image, narrative and ornament, style and ethnicity, courtly culture and religious practice. We will also discuss the pragmatics of conservation and illustration and the politics and ethics of the discovery, collection, and exportation of cultural patrimony.This seminar is supported by the Digital Humanities at Berkeley program, which will allow us to experiment with new technologies for imaging murals within their ancient contexts and to digitally record our seminar’s site visits to murals in the Bay Area. We will make visits as a class to see the Teotihuacan mural fragments at the de Young Museum, Diego Rivera’s 1940 Pan-American Unity mural at City College of San Francisco, and the small Rivera mural in Stern Hall on this campus.Prior knowledge of Pre-Columbian and/or Latin American art history is useful, but not required.

  TuTh 2-330P, 102 MOFFITTSimply put, art history is a history of image worlds, objects, and material practices. Could art history, then, help us better understand the haptic and visual potential of the latest iPad, the deification of the natural environment in ancient India, hallucinogenic-induced apparitions in Latin America, the alchemic power of blood in medieval Christian art, or even the kinesthetic of contemporary museum display? Co-taught by faculty specializing in Latin American, European, and South Asian art and architecture, Global Methods: Art History Today aims to do precisely that. The course is not designed to function as a history of world art or even a history of the discipline of art history, and it works very well as a supplement to HA 100. Rather, moving from the ancient to contemporary worlds, from the Americas to Asia, the course offers an indispensable toolkit for developing the required skills for visual analysis and interpretation. In the classroom, we will engage with major theoretical frameworks (for instance postcolonialism, feminism, and sexuality studies), critical methodologies (for instance formalism, sensory histories, and anthropology), and key concepts (for instance artist, mimesis, avant-garde). Our discussions in the classroom will be complemented by trips to local museums and Hindu temples to provide students with hands-on experience in fieldwork. At the same time, we will acquire a pragmatic foundation in framing research questions and writing papers in preparation for upper division coursework. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 375 | CCN: 05304   | 2 Units

  Th 1-3P, 308B DOE LIBRARYInstructor approval required. This seminar satisfies a University-wide requirement that all first-time Graduate Student Instructors take a pedagogy course. It can be taken concurrently with a first teaching assignment or in the semester before beginning teaching. The class will encourage you to think in larger terms about the function of pedagogy in art history–what we learn, what we teach, who we are as teachers in this field. You should learn how to lead a good section and how to grade exams effectively, but also how to help students think and write in visual terms, how to guide them to a more critical mode of reading, how to direct them in independent research, and how to ensure that they work to the best of their potential.Beyond that, this class is a pre-professional workshop, designed to help you plan what your teaching will be like when you are designing and instructing courses on your own. Throughout the semester you will be thinking about a class that you would like to teach some day in your field. You will make up paper assignments and exams for that class, and eventually you will draft a syllabus and part of your first lecture for that class. Your final project will be a “teaching portfolio” which will incorporate your syllabus, assignments, and a “teaching statement” explaining your personal philosophy of teaching. We will also be talking about the job market, interviewing, and job talks.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192B | CCN: 05103   | 4 Units

  M 9-12P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThis seminar will take an in-depth look at the relationship between ancient Persia  (from the time of Cyrus the Great to the rule of the Sassanians) and its neighbors westward (specifically, Greece and Rome). Beginning with a survey of cultural and political events leading to the formation of the Persian Empire under Cyrus II, we will examine archaeological and textual material representative of the 200 year rule of the Achaemenid Persian kings, observing how artistic and cultural exchange with Greece manifested in the material record. We will take particular note of the ‘East Greek’ and Anatolian regions, where artistic synthesis can be observed in such material as funerary monuments and glyptic.  We will then proceed with our archaeological and art historical analysis through the tumultuous histories of the Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian eras. Viewing the material first from the standpoint of the Persians and their political descendants, and then conversely through the somewhat biased lens of their neighbors westwards, we will piece together a fascinating tableau of artistic and cultural disdain or admiration, emulation and rejection.Required textbook and readings: Boardman, J., Persia and the West, 2000. There will also be a reader or selection of articles to aid with research.Course requirements include two presentations and a final research paper.

  M 12-3P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThe purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the way in which art history developed from the late 19th through the late 20th century, and to allow them to frame art history's current practices with that development in mind. We will proceed chronologically, reading critical texts and also historicizing them, thinking about what concerns were formulated and addressed at what historical moments, how the writing of art history is always of its moment in a way we may (or may not) want to describe as "political." I have tried to select readings that are both fundamental to the shaping of our discipline and in some way "typical" of their time, although certain texts really fall only into one or the other category. By the end of the semester, students should be able to think critically about art history writing and, eventually, about their own place in the field. Authors we read may include Hildebrand, Berenson, Wölfflin, Riegl, Warburg, Freud, Panofsky, Fry, Sedlmayr, Benjamin, Greenberg, Schapiro, Van Gulik, Gombrich, Kubler, Fried, Venturi, Clark, Baxandall, Damisch, Nochlin, Mulvey, Kristeva, Pollock, Barthes, Alpers, Koerner, Clunas, Gruzinski.

  TuTh 930-11A, 102 MOFFITTThis introductory lecture course poses a challenge: to look and think critically about the art and architecture of Japan. We will study a range of artistic/architectural works situated across a long historical span: objects and structures of the Neolithic and Tumuli eras; medieval to early modern narrative paintings, portraits, and woodblock prints; late medieval ceramic and lacquer arts; Buddhist temples, Shintō shrines, and castles; modern and contemporary art in global context; and so on.  We will consider: diverse visual, material, and spatial presences and practices; social-political histories; gender and race-ethnicity; as well as interregional, transnational encounter and translation. We will ask questions such as: what is painting in Japan (materiality, narrative, self-fashioning, ideology, etc.); how do Buddhist icons function as images; why are rough earthenware tea bowls among the most treasured artistic objects in Japan; what’s up with the representation of “Geisha;” what is a Zen rock garden; why is Hokusai’s famous “Great Wave” print a “great work of European art”; and so forth. What does study of art and architecture in Japan offer or reveal about art, history, modernity, and globalism? There are no Japanese studies or art history prerequisites for this course, and students from all colleges/majors are welcome. Active preparation and participation are necessary.

How are we placed in the cosmos; what constitutes the fundamental nature of our being; and in what ways can we be elevated, inspired, socialized, and corrupted? Our ways of answering these questions are said to have undergone a fundamental shift with the advent of renaissance  humanism. This course investigates the nature and extent of that shift, and asks which areas of thinking about mankind were more, and less, altered at the dawn of the modern period. Topics will include the ways in which the story of Creation was understood, the location of mankind in the universe, how law and society are formed by and set boundaries upon the fundamental nature of man, and the importance (and limits) of education. We will think about human pleasures (sinful or playful), the definition of human creativity, and how the human body and its failings are understood. We will end with death, war, and the apocalypse.Our particular focus will be on the ways in which the nature of mankind was visualized by European artists, from anonymous illuminators to Dürer, Holbein, Bosch and Bruegel, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Much of our reading will be from primary sources, including Paracelsus, Bartholomaeus Anglicus, Pico della Mirandola, Machiavelli, Thomas More, Erasmus, and Montaigne, as well as writing by artists.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 171 | CCN: 05054   | 4 Units

  Th 1-4P, 425 DOE LIBRARYIn the late nineteenth century, as the art history of East Asia was emerging as an academic field, works of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, and ceramic art preserved at the Zen Buddhist monastery Daitokuji, located in Kyoto, assumed prominence in the formalist projects of art historians and in Japan’s emerging corpus of government-registered cultural patrimony. Throughout the twentieth century, exhibitions at national and private museums in Japan and abroad, glossy picture books, specialized and popular writings in varied languages, and cultural property designations enriched knowledge of the monastery’s prestigious “art collection,” generated scholarly debate regarding the authorship and style of individual works, and established Daitokuji’s place in Japan’s artistic canon. Particular paintings such as the triptych of Guanyin, Gibbons, and Crane by the Chinese Song painter Muqi (c. early 13th c.) and calligraphies by the “Zen eccentric” Ikkyū Sōjun (1394-1481) attained masterpiece status as National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties and have since been imprinted indelibly upon the art historical eye and installed permanently into the national storehouse of Japan’s artistic past. In both scholarly and popular minds, Daitokuji remains a repository of exquisite and unmatched paintings, statuary, calligraphy, ceramic works, architecture, and landscape gardens, many viewed as quintessential examples of “Zen art and architecture.” This seminar—which will make use of a new collection of digital images—explores the art and architecture of Daitokuji through a selection of objects, buildings, episodes, and narratives. It works from the canon and established art historical discourse on the monastery’s art and architecture but seeks other objects and frames of analysis. In some regards our discussion will be situated within the broader art historical study of Buddhist sites and their diverse icons, images, sanctuaries, communities, and practices. We will trace the narratives that accumulated around such sites and tempt definitions of “Buddhist visual culture.”  We will likewise take issue with “Zen art” and explore recent revisionist writings within religious studies and art history. Graduate students from History of Art, Buddhist Studies, EALC, History, and other departments are welcome to participate for 2 or 4 units. Advanced undergraduate students may also be considered for enrollment. Participants will be asked to prepare weekly position papers on books and articles and, for students enrolled for 4 units, a substantial research paper of approximately 20-25 pages and presentation. The paper, developed with each participant’s research area in mind, should address specific objects, architectural settings, or contexts of reception, and it should demonstrate thoughtful assessment of existing scholarship and theoretical/methodological perspectives. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 130A | CCN: 04976

Materials include Neolithic ceramics and jade, bronze vessels and other objects of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the funerary arts--painting, sculpture, and grave goods--of the Qin and Han. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the complexity of China's cultural and artistic origins, on strategies for the ongoing (re)writing of history, and on developing analytical skills for dealing with visual materials from the distant past. In the course of the semester, students will be introduced to a number of approaches to prehistoric, proto-historic, and historic artifacts, from archaeological typology and formal analysis to Marxist theories of social evolution, text-based studies, cultural and intellectual history and theories of aesthetics and narrative.

  MWF 11-12P, 102 MOFFITTThis new survey will present examples from Italian art and literature from circa 1300 to circa 1600 as mirrors and motors of cultural change. Italy will be shown in its unique position between the Northern countries and the Mediterranean, allowing for porous borders of forms and contents in visual and textual media. One main focus will lay on the artistic exchange in centers such as Venice and Rome and the courts, another on the experience of the viewers and consumers of the time: What was the function of art? How do specific genres of texts relate to the artistic production? Every lecture will have a thematic core of art objects or theoretical interests, complemented by a short discussion of a related literary genre or example of a contemporary text (excerpts from canti, prayer books, treatises, sonnets, letters, workshop manuals, contracts, legal documents, novelle, lives of Saints and artists, etc.). This structure will allow for students to gain insights into the visual and textual material while developing an understanding for the functions of art and text in a specific historical context.  Texts:

  MW 4-530P, 106 MOFFITTThis course has two goals: to explore visual culture and the role of visuality in renaissance England, and to develop research skills.Elizabeth I's long reign saw a remarkable flowering of the arts.  Her unique position as a female monarch surrounded by male courtiers produced a dynamic in which all artistic production seemed to reflect back upon her, the powerful focus of men's desires and aspirations.  From the building of stately houses to the writing of poetry, a rhetoric of courtship and persuasion would underlie England's renaissance.  Following on a long period of state-sponsored iconoclasm, the status of the visual arts and their relationship to verbal expression also had to be redefined. This course will consider the Elizabethan period in relation to culture under Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII, her brother and sister, and her Stuart heir James I.  We will treat poetry, painting, and pageantry; rhetoric, architecture and urban development.  We will also pay close attention to the applied and domestic arts--furnishings, clothing, embroidery. Writers and artists we will discuss will include Holbein, More, Hilliard, Sidney, Smythson, Jones, Jonson, Van Dyck and Rubens.This course involves interdisciplinary, research-based learning.  The evaluation of your work will be based not on examinations but on a multi-part project, on which you will have extensive, structured guidance from the professor, the GSI, and the library staff.  You will write an original interdisciplinary research paper using primary sources available online.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and Chronological period (II). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192A | CCN: 05039   | 4 Units

Historians have now come to understand the early modern as fundamentally transcultural, a form of “globalization” before modernity. But what role did early modern trade networks and diplomacy, commodities and consumption, warfare and intrigue play in the production of objects? How did technology transfer reshape aesthetic taste? Conversely, in what ways did material objects participate in the development of the global early modern as a political, social, and intellectual condition? With these questions in mind, we will closely focus on one object each week to generate a theory of things circulating across the early modern world. Our interrogations will focus on the Mughal empire (1526–1858), the largest centralized Islamic state in this period, at the crossroads of European colonialism, inter-Asian trade networks, and exchanges across the Islamic world. Consequently, our visual archive will range from South Asian material in European kunstkammers to Chinese porcelain collections, the hybridization of animals and plants from Latin America, Islamic cartography, maritime engineering, automatons, and Jesuit print culture in the Mughal court. Our readings and discussions will also radiate outwards from Mughal South Asia to Europe, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian Ocean littoral. At the same time, we will visit the Asian Art Museum to study paintings in order to engage with the materiality of early modern things. Bringing together postcolonial theory and global art history, our aim will be to intercept and transcript the plurotopic transculturality internal to the early modern world.No previous background in art history, postcolonial theory, early modern studies, or South Asia is required.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (E) and Chronological period (II).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 236 | CCN: 05221   | 4 Units

  TuTh 330-5P, 103 MOFFITTHow has visual culture played a contested role within the social movements of the last several decades? How, we might ask, is activism made visible; how does it erupt (or disappear) with collective fields of vision?  Drawing upon South African lesbian photographer Zanele Muholi’s term “visual activism” as a flexible rubric that encompasses both formal practices and political strategies, this lecture class interrogates contemporary visual cultures of dissent and protest as they span a range of ideological positions. We will examine recent developments in and around recent intersections of art and politics, looking closely at performances, photographs, art objects, and graphic interventions from around the world, with a special focus on tactics of illegibility and fugitivity. Topics might include visual responses to structural racisms, global climate change, state violence, and queer/trans issues.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (C) and Chronological period (III).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 151 | CCN: 05037   | 4 Units

The first weeks of the class’ readings and lectures emphasize a historical understanding of the period, in particular the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the conflict between paganism and Christianity, the reasons and consequences for the fall of Rome and the Western Roman Empire, the rise of the Eastern Roman Empire, centered in Constantinople, and the first wave of Islamic expansion. The rest of the material is divided thematically. Art (such as mosaics, illuminated manuscripts, and ivories) and the built environment (palaces, churches, and cities) are taken as statements in discourses of power, Christian doctrine, spirituality, paganism, gender, and the holy.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and (D) and Chronological period (I).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192T | CCN: 05085   | 4 Units

  Th 2-5P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThis undergraduate seminar considers the visual arts in relation to behaviors that are generally deemed pernicious or at least provocative or sensational—art looting and theft, iconoclasm and vandalism, and forgery. Not, in other words, the sorts of behaviors one might conventionally associate with Art. As violent, arrogant, possessive, and deceitful as these “other” behaviors toward art may be, they turn out to be as prominent as aesthetic appreciation, religious inspiration, historical wonder, cultural edification, and so forth.  The seminar will focus on cases selected from along a broad chronological and geocultural range, each relevant to one (or more) of three themes—take, break, and fake. We will consider specific art works as they encounter and are shaped, deformed, or displaced by war and plunder from the ancient to modern world, colonialism and imperialist extraction, and modern looting for the art market; religious iconoclasm from the ancient to contemporary world and individual attacks upon art; and art forgers and forgery scandals, ancient to contemporary. We will address the role and interplay of particular and sometimes conflicting values, be they visual or political, religions, philosophical, or economic. We will ask, what do these cases reveal about what “art” is and does and how viewers respond to art?The seminar introduces scholarly readings and resources in each theme, as well as relevant topics (cultural heritage debates and laws; “authenticity” in relation to various forms of “copying” in the arts; the modern art market, etc.) and incorporates varied media and cultural representations (journalism, film, etc.).Participants (by instructor approval) will prepare short assignments on a weekly/biweekly basis—related to readings, film, and other materials—and, as the primary academic work for the course, develop and complete a formal research paper or, potentially, a multi/alternate-media/format project.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical Area (E) and Chronological Periods (II or III) depending on paper topic.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 290.2 | CCN: 05187   | 4 Units

  W 9-12P, 270 WURSTEROur cities are layered with pasts. Street names celebrate lost leaders and buildings provide tangible links to history. Monuments memorialize traumas that are also written on to the bodies of urban inhabitants. A palimpsest of destruction speaks to things that resist modern amnesia. How does the city inspire practices of remembering and forgetting? Whose past do we encounter and whose do we search for? How do we envision and shape ourselves as we destroy and preserve, create, recreate, and revive the city?In this seminar we will explore theories of the city and built environment with a focus on memory. Considering the combined civic and aesthetic functions of urban spaces, we will examine topics ranging from collective memory to architectural revival and preservation, from historic parks to modes of commemoration enacted in temporary artistic forms.The course will give students the opportunity to read widely across fields that link history, memory studies, and the built environment from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Texts may include John Ruskin on ruins, Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc on architectural preservation, Alois Riegl on conservation, Walter Benjamin on history, Henri Lefebvre on our right to the city, Paul Ricoeur on forgetting, Fredric Jameson and Svetlana Boym on nostalgia. We will also explore other ways of recalling a city’s past, including films and novels. Local sites will be both quarry and testing ground for our theoretical investigations. We may visit and study a variety of sites throughout the Bay Area, including San Francisco’s Holocaust Memorial by George Segal in Legion of Honor Park and National AIDS Memorial Grove in Golden Gate Park, as well as Richmond’s Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park and Berkeley’s People’s Park.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192F.2 | CCN: 05100   | 4 Units

  W 9-12P, 425 DOE LIBRARYThe domestic interior was central to the development of modern western art. It was a favorite subject for painters, a space of artistic display for new middle-class patrons, and often the site of artistic creation. This course explores the theme of the interior through diverse case studies including Impressionist paintings by Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, James McNeill Whistler’s controversial Peacock Room, Siegfried Bing’s Maison de l’Art Nouveau, and William Morris’s Arts and Crafts homes. During the semester we will consider the ways in which interiors and their representations contributed to the construction of identity, drawing on feminist and queer theoretical accounts of the politics of interior space. We will also discuss art in relation to the literature on the concept of public and private spheres.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (III).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 145A | CCN: 05028   | 4 Units

  TuTh 1230-2P, 106 MOFFITTThe art of painting was highly valued in ancient Italy from the earliest times. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the pre-Roman cultures of Italy—such as the Greeks, Leucanians, and Etruscans—all made extensive use of painting in various contexts.  This course will examine the relationship between Roman painting and the earlier pictorial traditions of ancient Italy, particularly that of the Etruscans.A number of questions will be pursued.  What role did painting play in Etruscan life?  How “public” were the tomb paintings of the Etruscans, and what is the relationship of Etruscan funerary imagery to daily life?  What paintings were available for later Romans to see when they took over Etruscan cities and cemeteries?  And more importantly, what sort of Etruscan innovations, conventions, and subject matter were adopted (or not) by the Romans?  What sort of paintings do we hear about in the writings of Latin authors?  Battle paintings, for example, carried in triumphal processions, and described by Roman historians; or Greek ‘old master’ paintings purchased for extravagant sums by art collectors like Lucullus and Hortensius, and cherished as their prize possessions—to the dismay of Roman moralists.  What kinds of pictures were set up as votives in Roman temples and public spaces?  What designs and subjects did ordinary Romans choose to have painted on the walls of their homes, their villas, and their tombs?This course will present the surviving evidence for a wide range of pictorial representation.  It will include a sampling of the surviving paintings from Etruscan tombs; the earliest pictorial remains from the city of Rome itself; the elaborate suites of painted rooms found in the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum on the Bay of Naples; and Roman mosaics—‘paintings in stone’—from Italy, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean.  Some topics to be considered: the funerary and non funerary themes found in Etruscan tomb painting; the Etruscan contribution to Roman painting; the ‘four styles’ of Pompeian interior decoration; the architect Vitruvius’ denunciation of contemporary painting in the early Augustan period; the reproduction of Greek ‘old master’ paintings from pattern books; the surviving paintings of the Domus Aurea, the emperor Nero’s gigantic ‘Golden House’ in Rome.There will be a mid-term exam, a short paper, and a final exam.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and Chronological period (I). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 100 | CCN: 05013   | 4 Units

  TuTh 2-330P, 101 MOFFITTThis course introduces theories and methods of art history that have played a major role in the formation of the discipline from the later eighteenth century to the present day. Readings include key texts by major art-writers, art theorists, and art historians, ranging widely and in roughly chronological order from early connoisseurs and iconologists to recent proponents of eco-aesthetics and affect theory. This course emphasizes the methods and theories developed in the Euro-American tradition of art history, while remaining attentive to critiques and shortcomings of that tradition. To explore this set of methods as it operates broadly and perhaps globally, we touch on art-historical practice in ancient, medieval, modern and contemporary studies, as well as from Western and non-Western contexts. In this class special attention focuses on the institutional and professional formation of art history, which includes consideration of careers art historians might have today.Previous coursework in art history is not required and non-majors are encouraged to take the course, but students may find it helpful to have completed a course in art history and/or related fields (e.g., film studies or art practice). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192F.1 | CCN: 05097   | 4 Units

    Christine Hult-Lewis
  M 2-5P, 7415 DWINELLEThis seminar will focus on three intertwined issues: photography in the American West, the ways in which these photographs were disseminated, and how these images defined and visualized the West for the rest of the country. Defining “the West” was a lively occupation in the nineteenth century, and photographers and artists were active participants in the ongoing conversation. Western views were not uninflected: they were seen as stereos in the mass market, as part of government surveys and ethnographic reports, in the promotional literature of railroads, agriculture, and mining corporations, and as art objects on the walls of local and national art exhibitions and fairs. We will concentrate primarily on images by Carleton Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge, Timothy O’Sullivan, Alexander Gardner, William Henry Jackson, Jack Hillers, and Edward Curtis, with attention to their patrons, directives, and the publication history of the images. When possible, we will view original photographs and photographically-illustrated books in the Bancroft Library. By the end of the course, students should have a nuanced understanding of the narrative and discursive power—and limitations—of photographs and their role in shaping and understanding history.
Students will ideally have some background in the history of photography and/or history of the American West.

We will examine the changes from Medieval traditions, Cimabue, and Giotto to the classical Renaissance examples (Fra Angelico, Ghirlandaio, Gozzoli, Pisanello, Mantegna, the Ferrarese painters, Botticelli, Perugino, Raphael, Michelangelo) and their impact on later re-inventions of walls and wall decoration (Leonardo, Palladio, the Carracci, Correggio, Giulio Romano, Veronese, Rubens, Tiepolo). This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and Chronological period (II).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 11 | CCN: 04977   | 4 Units

  TuTh 11-1230P, 160 KROEBERThis course is an introduction to visual art in Europe and the USA since the 14th century with the main emphasis on painting and sculpture.  Rather than attempting to offer a sweeping synthetic narrative of the development of art during five centuries (an impossible task!), this course intensively focuses upon a roughly chronological set of case-studies, sometimes of single works, sometimes of one or two artists’ careers.  These relatively intensive case-studies will pose fundamental problems about the character and purposes of art in different historical circumstances. Together, however, the lectures will reconstruct the broader historical transformations of art, its production and reception during this period. We will explore the ways visual culture can function as a stabilizing force as well as the ways art can contribute to social and political transformation, even revolution. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 175 | CCN: 05055   | 4 Units

Beginning with the architecture, processions, painting, prints and decorative arts of the School of Fontainebleau, the representation of gender along with the early modern French colonial imaginary. We will address the development of the Royal Academy and its interaction with popular culture, which culminates in the display of ambitious art in the public space of the pre-revolutionary Salon exhibition. We will examine Classical triumphal processions that included the spectacle of Brazilian tribal warfare; the appreciation and collecting of intimate canvases (Poussin); the early modern state’s investment in urban renewal in Paris and cultural spectacle at Versailles; the intimate and complex objects and spaces in Rococo interiors (Watteau, Boucher) and public forms of display and art criticism (Chardin, Diderot). Among our inquiries will be Feminist court culture, the literary and material cultures of humanism, the transmission of ancient Roman antiquity, models of popular and elite culture, female portraiture and the myth of, aristocratic cultural resistance and connoisseurship, the optical, philosophical and colonial furniture of the French Enlightenment, and the emergence of pre-Revolutionary artistic institutions (public art exhibitions, lectures, academic studio training and formal art criticism). This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) or (E) depending on paper topic, and Chronological period (II).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 270 | CCN: 05175   | 4 Units

In addition to reading the recent literature in this temporal and geographic field (Cummins, Leibsohn, Mundy, Seed among others), the seminar will consider the latent potential of modes of art historical explanation that have addressed the persistence of images and the role of materiality in representation (Semper, Riegl, Warburg, Kubler). Emphasis will be placed on developing transposable models by studying transcultural historical phenomena that have been structured by a variety of legacies including Greco-Roman antiquity, Arabic epistemologies, the representation of Islam (Reconquista), indigenous pictorial survivals, cross-cultural scribal practices and biological metaphor (mestizaje) by different early modern (imperial) constituencies. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 27 | CCN: 04998   | 4 Units

  TuTh 2-330P, 106 MOFFITTThis course explores the dreams of newness that traversed modernity's overlapping geopolitical spaces, 1900-1968, and gave rise to experimental artistic practices around the world. In particular, we focus on the formation and reformation of four paradigms of avant-garde efforts: Futurism, Constructivism, Surrealism, and Socialist Realism. These are considered via close studies of the work of artists and art groups in Russia, the Middle East, North Africa, the North Atlantic, Latin America, India, Japan, China, and elsewhere, and accompanied by the fresh examination of influential theories of the avant-garde. Rather than maintain a strict division between historical and "neo" avant-garde projects, as has often structured the study of the European avant-garde, the course instead explores the fluid and productive interplay between Futurist, Constructivist, Surrealist, or Socialist Realist projects and the many cultural, social, and economic conditions of the twentieth century.

  W 2-5P, 308B DOE LIBRARYThe course will interrogate abstraction as a strategy in 20th and 21st century art around the globe, and its manifold implications for political projects of being, seeing, and knowing together. We will look at how various artists turn to non-representation as a means for thinking differently about issues as divergent as flatness, vision, progress, decay, identity, violence, solidarity, negation, and protest. How might we read acts of judgment performed by abstract artists, i.e. separating what is alien from that which is intrinsic, as politically activated? How do we account for the ways abstraction has figured centrally not only in modernist art histories, but also in economic and political theories (as in the abstraction of use into exchange value)? How, too, have representation and figuration (as ostensible opposites of abstraction) been positioned as ethical tactics? We will take an object-oriented approach that foregrounds the complexity of movement between “thing” and abstract “effect.” The course pursues  comparative readings as well, exploring the turn to abstraction in affinity with Islamic, Jewish, or mystical metaphysics that treat the representation of living beings with suspicion; divergent valences in postwar abstract painting; and contemporary abstraction as it supports coded meanings, eccentricities, and alternative (feminist, queer, marginal, racialized) formations. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192M | CCN: 05105   | 4 Units

  MTuWTh 12-2P, 103 MOFFITTThis course examines the profound ambivalence of the photographic medium, a visual technology of both subjugation and empowerment. Looking at a wide array of photographic practices in the United States between 1850 and the present, we will explore how the medium has been used by artists, activists, educators, civil servants, newspaper editors and other cultural producers to visualize politics and social culture. The roles of photography in constructing race, sexuality, gender, class, and nationality will figure prominently in our readings and discussions. Other topics will include photographs of war and atrocity; the ethnographic gaze of the camera; documentary photography of the WPA era; photographs of the civil rights struggle; photographic reclamations in black feminist art; censorship and archival absences; the “queer camera,” and contemporary global art photography. Throughout the course, students will be asked to critically interpret the relationships that photographs inscribe between photographers, photographic subjects, and viewers. By the end of the course, they will have acquired the theoretical proficiency and historical knowledge to analyze and engage in sustained debate about a wide variety of photographic images.
 
Histories of Photography encourages students to view photographs in person at Bay Area institutions such as SFMOMA, the Oakland Museum of California and Pier 24, as well as campus collections at the Berkeley Art Museum and the Bancroft Library.

This course explores how race, gender, sexuality, class, ability, nationality, and other axes of identity affect the ways in which art is produced, circulated, and consumed. While students will be familiarized with the conventional history of modern and contemporary American art, they will also be challenged to ask questions such as, how does identity shape the canons and categories of Art History? Is it always important to take an artist’s identity into account when interpreting their artwork? Does an artist from a marginalized group have a responsibility to address their identity in their art? And how does identity affect our own scholarly approaches to art and visual culture?  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 39G | CCN: 31503

  Wednesday | 10:00 - 12:00PMThis class is about renaissance humanists and how we can use digital means, as well as traditional ones, to study them. Our particular focus is on the ways people were connected in the renaissance -- as patrons, as readers, as travelers, as correspondents. Students will gather data about the travels and connections of their individual humanists. Then, working in groups, they will form databases and use mapping and network analysis on their data to chart interconnections between these historical figures over time. Figures to be studied will include Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus, Durer, Isabella d'Este, Henry VIII, and other patrons, artists, and writers of this period.

Italy will be shown in its unique position between the Northern countries and the Mediterranean, allowing for porous borders of forms and contents in visual and textual media. One main focus will lay on the artistic exchange in centers such as Venice and Rome and the courts, another on the experience of the viewers and consumers of the time: What was the function of art? How do specific genres of texts relate to the artistic production? Every lecture will have a thematic core of art objects or theoretical interests, complemented by a short discussion of a related literary genre or example of a contemporary text (excerpts from canti, prayer books, treatises, sonnets, letters, workshop manuals, contracts, legal documents, novelle, lives of Saints and artists, etc.).

  Tuesday, Thursday: 11:00 - 12:30PMThis course surveys Greek sculpture, painting, and architecture from the Persian invasions to the death of Alexander the Great. In addition to close study of the major works (Olympia, the Riace bronzes, the Parthenon, Praxiteles’ Knidian Aphrodite and Hermes, the Mausoleum, etc.), we shall pay particular regard to their cultural context and to key issues such as the relation between Greek art and life, nakedness and gender, war and the warrior, the symposion, narrative strategies, art and politics, the luxury crafts, and the status of the creative artist. Wherever possible, newly discovered work will be included and given special attention.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and Chronological period (I).

  Mon. | Wed. | Fri. | 3:00 - 4:00PMThis class focuses on theories and visualizations of race in the United States during the twentieth century. Class sessions will be organized around chronological case studies of diverse subjects made in varied media, including Thomas Dewing’s tonalist paintings, baby albums, the art of the Harlem Renaissance, photographs of WWII Japanese American internment, civil rights movement posters, and conceptual art by the collective ASCO. Drawing on critical theories of race and representation, in this course we will interrogate complex and sometimes vexing notions of race, ethnicity, visuality, visibility, authorship, identity and display in historical context.  This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (C) and Chronological period (III).

  Mon. | Wed. | Fri. | 2:00 - 3:00PMThis course will introduce to Buddhist art and architecture in Tibet and Mongolia through architectural examples and case studies roughly following chronological order from imperial Tibet in the 7th century until the rule of Gelug protagonists in the early 20th century. We will learn about specifics of Tibetan Buddhist architecture and unique cases of Mongolian nomadic temple building; organization of space in different types of Buddhist architecture, their unique iconographic programs, and will discuss, where possible, how images were placed and used in the original context. 
Through examining art and architecture, the course will also explore the political, social, and cutlural relations between Tibet and Mongolia developed through centuries. We will ask how each culture addressed such critical issues as, for example, “image” in a Buddhist context, portraiture and representation of lamas and protagonists, and how a Tibetan Buddhist sect--the Gelugpa--gained its domineering presence across borders in the later periods.
Structured around two thematic units “Architectural Space and Iconographies” and “Politics of Representation,” the course will encourage thinking critically about the methodology applied in the study of Tibetan and Mongolian arts. Since our primary focus will be on Buddhist art and architecture, the course will also discuss essential Buddhist terms and concepts as well as the most prominent Buddhist deities.
No pre-requisites are required to enroll in this course.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (B) and Chronological period (II).

  Tuesday, Thursday | 5:00 - 6:30PMThis course explores modern collections and interpretations of ancient arts broadly and globally defined to include, for example, “prehistoric” arts and indigenous “traditional” arts that have very contemporary expressions (e.g., aboriginal Australia; San cultures of South Africa), focusing on the study of these arts in the professional disciplines of art history, archaeology, and anthropology. Because these disciplines originated as academic investigations in the West (especially in German, French, and British museums and universities in the nineteenth century), it is not surprising that one of the chief topics—a focus—of ancient art studies has been the ancient art of the Western tradition, namely, the art of the Greco-Roman world in relation to its immediate historical antecedents (especially Egyptian and ancient Near Eastern arts). But ancient arts from around the world have also been the subject of “Western” investigation, increasingly interacting with the study of the same arts by scholars whose cultural and intellectual foundations lie outside the “West.” These developments will be considered in five thematic units: (1) Classical Naturalism and Anthropomorphism; (2) Ancient Egyptian Conceptualism; (3) The “Origins of Art”; (4) The Anthropology of “Primitive” Art; and (5) Art Outside Culture?This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (E) and Chronological period (I) or (III). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 190T.2/Rhetoric 136 | CCN: 31488

  Mon. | Wed. | Fri. | 10:00 - 11:00AMThe course surveys critical controversies surrounding fakes, forgeries, multiples, counterfeits, imitations, and appropriations from the Late Renaissance to the present day, in European, American, Australian and Chinese art. Each of the images and objects we will examine sparked extensive debate in art history, philosophy, anthropology, social theory or legal studies, around which we will build our own discussions. Through a series of historical case studies, we will track how copies are excised—and sometimes reinstated—into the status of art, and delve into the impact of the copy on the rhetorics of authorship, genius, individuality, expertise and technology. We will be reading  theoretical texts on copies in various historical and cultural contexts, with an eye towards learning the various disciplinary methods that have been taken up to define and evaluate them. Two writing assignments and a final research paper are designed to develop our awareness to the rhetorics of visual and material analysis, and of historical narratives of invention, imitation and appropriation.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (E) and Chronological period (III).

    Gregory Levine, 
  Thursday | 2:00 - 5:00PMThis seminar seeks to learn from artists in Japan responding to the seismic, tsunami, and radiological disasters that struck Japan on March 3, 2011  and to ask larger questions about representation and disaster: how and where does creative response take place in the aftermath of hyper-scale natural destruction, horrifying loss of life, and multiple forms of dislocation and trauma? How do the visual arts express individual and collective meanings and visualize home, landscape, and “forbidden zones” and “wastelands,” as well as ongoing but not necessarily visible conditions of natural and human-caused precarity? How, indeed, can representation happen; how does it take place, both as active response and in relationship to physical, geographical, and ecological place? How do “aftermath” and “art” push against each other, how does visual expression make sensory (sensible) what is non-visible, and how might art refuse the (human) conditions and politics that contribute to precarity in conjunction with geophysical or planetary events? How might the arts help heal?Engaging the work of multiple artists—including Arakawa Tomoo and Ei, Chim↑Pom, Hatakeyama Naoya, Kawakubo Yoi., Shiga Lieko, amd Suga Yusukei—we will consider how 3/11 representation witnesses, struggles to understand, heals, disobeys, and protests specific human causes and responses. How have such artists deployed or upended “traditional” or established media, imageries, formats, and performance? How do site-specific work and off-site/global works respond? How has post-3/11 creative work in Japan sought to change Japan; what sorts of visual and political imaginaries do we find? How have galleries, museums, and web-based and social media shown and circulated art responding to 3/11? How does creative work sustain healing and protest? What can we learn from Japan’s new disaster literatures (shinsai bungaku) and disaster art (shinsai bijutsu)?Working firstly from the responses of artists to 3/11, the seminar will also consider representation and disaster historically in Japan—noting premodern representations of “misfortune” and the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923—alongside California earthquakes and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Given the radioactive contamination issuing from Fukushima, we will also address artists responding to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and to nuclear contamination at the Nevada Test Site.Key texts for the class (purchase not required) include: Anne N. Morse and Anne E. Havinga, ed. In the Wake: Japanese Photographers Respond to 3/11 (2015); Lisbette Gebhardt and Yuki Masami, eds., Literature and Art after “Fukushima:” Four Approaches (2014); Gennifer Weisenfeld, Imaging Disaster: Tokyo and the Visual Culture of Japan’s Great Earthquake of 1923 (2012); Rebecca Solnit, Savage Dreams: A Journey into the Hidden Wars of the American West (1994).
Participants will prepare weekly assignments and complete a formal research paper or, potentially, a historically based multi/alternate-media/format project. The seminar will also address academic research and writing. The seminar may be taken for 2 units.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (B) and Chronological period (III). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 234 | CCN: 16472   

    Gregory Levine, 
  Tuesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmWhat do display (a placeholder for contexts separate from the modern museum and gallery) and exhibition offer critical study of “Japanese art,” ancient to contemporary? Put to the task of listing such spaces—and thinking of events as much as things—we might begin with the following:Religious enshrinement and ritual; funerals/memorials and icon unveilings (kaichō, degaichō); imperial/aristocratic collections (e.g. Shōsōin, Reizeike) and elite access; airings (bakuryō, mushiboshi) of court, warrior, and temple-shrine treasures; Shogunal visits (onari) and display of continental art objects; Chakai and tea utensil ensembles; Meiji period exhibitions (hakurankai), national patrimony, and public viewing; Japan at the World’s Fairs; modern official painting exhibitions (Inten, Bunten); exhibitions of “Japanese folk art;” alternative happenings, street theater, and avant-garde performance; postwar overseas loan exhibitions of Japanese art; Japanese artists at the Venice Biennial and other invitational shows…By whom, how, and why have these categories of display/exhibition been configured and enacted, and what sorts of objects (materials, styles, identities, ontologies, histories) do they depend on, make visible (or hide), and empower? How do they operate in relationship to art theory/discourse, histories of collecting, gender, class, race-ethnicity, art world economies, and nationalism? To what ends (creative, ritual, relational, performative, social, and ideological) are these events organized? How do objects “program” response? Who curates, views, reviews, or challenges?Study of selected case studies will proceed from primary texts and representations (diaries and documents, treatises, newspapers, art criticism, exhibition catalogs; photographic representation, ethnography…) alongside comparative cases outside Japan and critical writings in visual studies and museology. Participants will prepare weekly critical responses and presentations, and (for 4 units) complete a contained object/site-focused research project and formal written essay. The seminar may be taken for 2 units. Advanced undergraduates with prior course work in art history may apply to participate with a brief explanation of interest and the course’s relevance to major area(s).

  Friday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThis is a hands-on seminar designed to introduce qualified students to the "nuts and bolts" of Greek and Roman art, in the form of intensive study of selected objects in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology on campus.We shall focus upon sculpture, vases, and coins, paying special attention to object histories, materials, techniques, detection of re-cutting and restorations, identification of subject matter, style and provenance, classification, and description. Students will select their own objects for study, subject to the approval of the instructor and the Museum's conservation staff. Two brief in-class presentations and a final paper are required.Participants must be juniors, seniors, or graduates at pre-MA level. They must have taken at least one course in Greek or Roman art or archaeology (not necessarily in the History of Art Department). Enrollment is limited to 9.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and Chronological period (I).

  Wednesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmThe Proseminar is required of first-year PhD students in History of Art; it is open to first-year students in other programs by permission of the instructor. In a mixture of lectures, discussion of readings, and student presentations, the seminar engages some of the main writers, movements of thoughts, and institutional, professional, and cultural developments in the formation of art history as a discipline. Though its focus is largely historiographic—looking back at key developments, such as the formation of “formalism” as the history of vision, the rise of iconology, and the interventions of the sociology and social history of art—it also deals with contemporary intersections (visual culture studies, world art studies, “global” temporalities – periodizations, and the new neuropsychologies of art). Some attention will also be paid to “practical” issues in art-historical training today, such as the role of foreign languages and fieldwork, the challenges of archival projects, and the structure of employment. Students will make brief presentations on readings, lead group discussions on individual seminar topics, and present a critical research paper on aspects of current art-historical practice in light of historiographic and conceptual considerations.

    Henrike C. Lange, 
  Monday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThis graduate seminar opens a wide historiographic panorama on Botticelli’s life and works from his time to the present day. Following the participants’ interests, we will focus with increasing intensity on the nineteenth-century making of Botticelli (Pater, Ruskin, the Pre-Raphaelites), on the early modern sources (from the first anonymous notes to Vasari), and their reading in the late nineteenth century (Aby Warburg’s 1893 dissertation, Sandro Botticellis “Geburt der Venus” und “Frühling”: Eine Untersuchung über die Vorstellungen von der Antike in der italienischen Frührenaissance) to the late twentieth century’s theoretical approaches to Botticelli’s intensely erotic, devastatingly beautiful, and at times likewise devastatingly violent imagery (Georges Didi-Huberman’s 1999 Ouvrir Vénus: Nudité, rêve, cruauté).
We will discuss themes of the body and nature, allegories, Antiquity, nudity, heroes, Madonne, Rome as commemorated in Botticelli’s Sistine Chapel frescoes, Dante as imagined in Botticelli’s illustrations for the Divine Comedy, the Medici and Savonarola as major factors in the social fabric around the artist, his graphic work, his mannerism, and the responses to Botticelli in the twentieth century (from the spheres of advertising to Andy Warhol). With the last chapter, we will enter the current discussions of the innovative exhibit “Botticelli Reimagined” (organised by the V&A and the Gemäldegalerie – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, on view in London 5 March 2016 – 3 July 2016). This most recent exhibit on Botticelli involves Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, and Bill Viola as well as those earlier artistic responses to Botticelli by Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edgar Degas, and René Magritte.
            While the course aims at increasing the awareness for the different historiographic lenses one is used to look at early modern artists in general, it is in constant dialogue with the works. Botticelli’s paintings will therefore appear in a likewise reflected sequence of different art historical approaches, from the material study of the conservator’s perspective to iconographical analysis with appropriate biblical and ancient sources, and approaches from theory. At the end of the course, we will have developed a more complex and more complete image of Botticelli’s works on the one hand, and of the long history of writings about these works on the other hand.The course will be held in English; all required readings are in English. Additional readings in Italian, German, French, and Spanish will be discussed in class according to the participants’ individual levels of reading knowledge in these languages.

Students will be introduced to the processes of art production and conservation through the technical analysis of artifacts.  We will also consider the theoretical dimensions of conservation and the ways materials change over time with a view to sharpening analytical skills.

  Friday | 9:15 - 11:15amThis class will be both a pedagogy course and a pre-professional workshop. It will encourage you to think in larger terms about the function of pedagogy in art history–what we learn, what we teach, who we are as teachers in this field.  You will develop strategies to lead a good section and to grade exams effectively, but also to help students think and write in visual terms, to guide them to a more critical mode of reading, to direct them in independent research, and to ensure that they work to the best of their potential.Beyond that, this class is a workshop designed to help you plan what your teaching will be like when you are designing and instructing courses on your own. Throughout the semester you will be thinking about a class that you would like to teach some day in your field. You will make up paper assignments and exams for that class, and eventually you will draft a syllabus and part of your first lecture for that class. Your final project will be a “teaching portfolio” which will incorporate your syllabus, assignments, and a “teaching statement” explaining your personal philosophy of teaching. We will also be talking about the job market, interviewing, and job talks.This seminar satisfies a University-wide requirement that all first-time Graduate Student Instructors take a pedagogy course. It can be taken concurrently with a first teaching assignment or in the semester before beginning teaching.

  Tuesday, Thursday: 11:00 - 12:30PMWhat form can be given to modernity?  What were the national, colonial, class and gender politics of modern self-fashioning in late 19th-century French art?  On what basis should we evaluate avant-garde practice? This class will focus on the period from the 1860s to 1900, considering not only the avant-garde painting movements typically called Impressionism and Post-Impressionism but also the broader visual culture of late 19th-century France. Thus the course will examine orientalism and primitivism as well as the impact of technological transformation, mass production, universal exhibitions, and reproductive technologies such as photography and the illustrated press.This is a rich and fascinating period of art-making as well as cultural and technological transformation. This class will necessarily focus on the case-studies that I find most illuminating: for instance, the art of painters Manet, Monet, Degas, Cassatt, and Seurat and sculptors Bartholdi and Carpeaux, the Eiffel Tower and the Universal Exhibitions of 1889 and 1900.  But many artists and much art will not be covered extensively, including perhaps some of your favorites, for example, Renoir or Van Gogh. What will receive more extensive consideration than usual are sculpture and new technologies, including photography, photosculpture, industrial construction, and mass entertainments such as the Universal Exhibitions and wax museums.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical areas (A) and Chronological period (III).

  Wednesday | 5:15 - 7:15pmThe seminar and residency will explore the work of the most influential psychoanalyst writing in English today, Christopher Bollas, who will be scholar-in-residence at the Townsend Center in the first week of November 2016. Bollas is widely known for his pioneering, polymathic, and maverick investigations of unconscious perception of objects and the object world, including human beings—work that has been highly suggestive for many domains of the humanities and social sciences—and more recently for his exploration of fractured unconsciousness (anxiety, hysteria, breakdown, and schizophrenia). Prior to Bollas’s visit, we will discuss his published works (including The Freudian Moment, The Shadow of the Object, Being a Character, and When the Sun Bursts: The Enigma of Schizophrenia) as well as forthcoming and in-progress work that he will provide. Students will present their own projects to the group, and will develop questions to be tabled for seminars with Bollas himself and for one-on-one meetings with him during his residency.The three advance seminars will be convened by Professor Whitney Davis (History of Art) and Professor Alan Tansman (East Asian Languages and Cultures, and Director of the Townsend Center), and will meet on three Wednesdays (September 21 and October 5 and 18) from 5:15 – 7 p.m. Participants must attend all three sessions, participate in one-on-one meetings with Bollas, and attend the associated public events of his residency that take place daily from October 31 through November 4.The mini-course is open to graduate students in any program, for 1-unit credit.

  Tuesday | 9:00 - 12:00pmTaking the work of Pieter Bruegel as its visual focus, this seminar considers how group identification was formed, and what defined exclusion from those groups, in northern Europe of the early- to mid-16th century.  We will focus on questions integral to a renaissance conception of social belonging: local identities (urban/cultured vs. rural/natural, communal vs. national/imperial); the normative body and physical othering (gendering, the disabled, the racially other); and dwelling vs. a state of placelessness (vagrants, beggars, itinerant artists, other sorts of travelers, prisoners).  We will consider Bruegel’s paintings, prints and drawings as the testimony of an artist thinking about what it means to belong, or not, in renaissance Europe, and we will read primary texts and documents about ‘monsters’, vagrants, and soldiers; travel literature and “underworld” texts. This class may be taken for 2 units (without research component) or for 4. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 24 | CCN: 33936

  Thursday | 9:00 - 12:00pmDigital photography and image processing have radically transformed the production and distribution of visual culture. Although these tools now allow us access to new types of data, and some of them have been widely adopted as infrastructural components of art historical publishing and pedagogy, they have yet to be critically examined for the methodolical contributions they might make to the field. Over the semester, students will be introduced to many of these technologies (including laser scanning, photogrammetry, Photoshop, and 3D modeling and rendering) and will learn to use them firsthand in the lab and during field trips to local museums and cultural heritage sites. Questions we will ask over the course of the semester include the following:

How can we tell when an image has been altered?

How is digital documentation used for cultural heritage and historical preservation?

How can these tools be used to situate a work of art in its original visual ecology? How are museums doing this with interactive displays?

What is the broader impact of these technologies as they are utilized in legal, commercial, and medical contexts?

  Tuesday | Thursday: 9:30 - 11:00amThis course is an introduction to visual art in Europe and the USA since the 14th century with the main emphasis on painting and sculpture.  Rather than attempting to offer a sweeping synthetic narrative of the development of art during five centuries (an impossible task!), this course intensively focuses upon a roughly chronological set of case-studies, sometimes of single works, sometimes of one or two artists’ careers.  These relatively intensive case-studies will pose fundamental problems about the character and purposes of art in different historical circumstances. Together, however, the lectures will reconstruct the broader historical transformations of art, its production and reception during this period. We will explore the ways visual culture can function as a stabilizing force as well as the ways art can contribute to social and political transformation, even revolution.  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 35 | CCN: 31991

  Tuesday | Thursday: 8:00 - 9:30amThis introductory survey poses a challenge: to look and think critically about the art and architecture of Japan, ancient to contemporary. We will study a range of artistic/architectural categories and styles across a long historical span: objects and structures of the Neolithic and Tumuli eras; Buddhist  icons; pictorial and calligraphic works related to the brush arts in East Asia; figural and landscape works of the medieval to early modern eras (narrative paintings, portraits, and woodblock prints); ceramic and lacquer arts; Buddhist temples, Shintō shrines, and castles; modern and contemporary art in a global context; and so on. We will consider: diverse visual, material, and spatial presences and practices; social-political histories; gender and race; and inter-regional, transnational encounter and translation. We will ask questions such as: why do images of the Buddha seem to look alike (do they really?); why are rough earthenware tea bowls among the most treasured artistic objects in Japan; what’s up with the representation of “Geisha;” what is a Zen rock garden; why is Hokusai’s famous “Great Wave” print a “great work of European art”; and so forth.

Course sessions will be organized around chronological case studies of diverse subjects made in varied media and may incorporate: Native American landscape architecture, Spanish maps and missions, Russian ethnographic illustrations, advertisements spurring the Gold Rush, paintings of Mexican Ranchos and the Western landscape, photographs of San Francisco’s Chinatown and Japanese internment, Polynesian-inspired surfing films, and Black Panther posters. This class will visit campus and Bay Area museums with related collections. It is designed for majors and non-majors with interests in art history, art practice, architecture, landscape design, ethnic studies, and the history of California.

  Monday | Wednesday: 5:00 - 6:30pmThis course is required of majors in History of Art. It reviews major paradigms of art-historical method and theory in relation to relevant developments in philosophy, aesthetics, history, anthropology, and other disciplines. Topics include antiquarianism, the legacy of critical idealism, stylistic analysis and connoisseurship, formalism, iconography, visual studies and vision science, gender in the arts, world art studies, digital horizons in art history, and neuroaesthetics among others. The course is appropriate for students who have taken lecture and/or seminar courses in various fields of art history (e.g., in Modern Art or Asian Art) and/or in closely cognate subjects (e.g., in Classical Archaeology, Critical Theory, or Aesthetics). It is not suitable for students with no background in art history; it is not a first course in or introduction to the history of art.

  Mon. | Wed. | Fri. | 11:00 - 12:00pmThis course introduces tools and methods of the Digital Humanities as they can be used in studying the art and literature of the early modern period. Our focus is on how, around 1600, things were in motion: people, but also objects and ideas. By 1600, more than a century had gone by since the invention of printing, the ‘discovery’ of the Americas, and the adoption of near-mass-production methods in artists’ workshops. Technologies of navigation and mapping made travel more possible, and both texts and images were being widely distributed for both economic and ideological reasons. Digital tools offer us ways to track, visualize, and interpret some of these mobilities.
The class will be broken into three loosely interrelated projects across disciplines (history, art history, literature), each of which will involve both individual and group work. In each project you will gather and interpret data, will learn a digital tool or set of tools, and will develop a sense of how working digitally in this field changes the scope and potential of the questions that we, as humanists, ask of our cultural materials.
There are no prerequisites for this course. We certainly do not expect that you know any coding, but we welcome anybody who does!This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (II).  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 134A | CCN: 31997

  Tuesday | Thursday: 2:00 - 3:30pmThis course introduces the art and architecture of Buddhist temples in Japan. The Buddhist temple (tera)—monastery, convent, private chapel, hub of devotion and popular culture, and so forth—has been a key religious space in Japan and has had an enduring impact upon architecture and the visual arts. We will examine selected sites and explore their histories and art histories, keeping an eye on broader themes: what were temple architectural and artistic requirements; how did painted and sculpted icons make deities and Buddhist teachings present for religious communities; and how were ensembles of art and architecture developed in relation to doctrine and ritual? We will also consider the preservation of temple architecture and the transformation of icons into works of art during the 19th and 20th centuries.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (B) and Chronological period (I) or (II).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA C145A/Classics C175F | CCN: 33100

  Tuesday | Thursday: 12:30 - 2:00pmThe art of painting was highly valued in ancient Italy from the earliest times. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the pre-Roman cultures of Italy—such as the Greeks, Leucanians, and Etruscans—all made extensive use of painting in various contexts.  This course will examine the relationship between Roman painting and the earlier pictorial traditions of ancient Italy, particularly that of the Etruscans.A number of questions will be pursued.  What role did painting play in Etruscan life?  How “public” were the tomb paintings of the Etruscans, and what is the relationship of Etruscan funerary imagery to daily life?  What paintings were available for later Romans to see when they took over Etruscan cities and cemeteries?  And more importantly, what sort of Etruscan innovations, conventions, and subject matter were adopted (or not) by the Romans?  What sort of paintings do we hear about in the writings of Latin authors?  Battle paintings, for example, carried in triumphal processions, and described by Roman historians; or Greek ‘old master’ paintings purchased for extravagant sums by art collectors like Lucullus and Hortensius, and cherished as their prize possessions—to the dismay of Roman moralists.  What kinds of pictures were set up as votives in Roman temples and public spaces?  What designs and subjects did ordinary Romans choose to have painted on the walls of their homes, their villas, and their tombs?This course will present the surviving evidence for a wide range of pictorial representation.  It will include a sampling of the surviving paintings from Etruscan tombs; the earliest pictorial remains from the city of Rome itself; the elaborate suites of painted rooms found in the houses of Pompeii and Herculaneum on the Bay of Naples; and Roman mosaics—‘paintings in stone’—from Italy, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean.  Some topics to be considered: the funerary and non funerary themes found in Etruscan tomb painting; the Etruscan contribution to Roman painting; the ‘four styles’ of Pompeian interior decoration; the architect Vitruvius’ denunciation of contemporary painting in the early Augustan period; the reproduction of Greek ‘old master’ paintings from pattern books; the surviving paintings of the Domus Aurea, the emperor Nero’s gigantic ‘Golden House’ in Rome.There will be a mid-term exam, a short paper, and a final exam.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (I).  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 188A | CCN: 32906

  Mon. | Wed. | Fri. | 10:00 - 11:00amThe Western Hemisphere was a setting for outstanding accomplishments in the visual arts for millennia before the arrival of Europeans in the so-called “New World.” This course explores the indigenous artistic traditions of what is now Latin America, from the earliest monuments of the formative periods (e.g. Olmec and Chavín), through acclaimed eras of aesthetic and technological achievement (e.g. Maya and Moche), to the later Inca and Aztec (i.e. Mexica) imperial periods. Our subject will encompass diverse genre including painting and sculpture, textiles and metalwork, architecture and performance. Attention will focus on the two cultural areas that traditionally have received the most attention from researchers: Mesoamerica (including what is today Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras) and the central Andes (modern Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador). We will also critique the drawing of those boundaries—both spatial and temporal—that define "Pre-Columbian" art and culture. More than a recitation of periods, styles, and monuments, we will assess the varieties of evidence available for interpretations of artworks that were created, for the most part, in settings without written texts.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (C) and Chronological period (I) or (II), based on the topic of the final research paper or project. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192A | CCN: 32037

  Tuesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmThe seminar will look into questions provoked by modern practices of Asian artists that take their homes, exhibitions, and workshops across continents. While in the world of globalization we all are uprooted in one way or another, a question of belonging seems to be a complex one with contemporary artists, especially with those who chose to live outside their homes of origin.  How does contemporary art respond to these frequent changes in social and cultural life of these artists? How do contemporary Asian artists view, make use of, and think of traditions? 
The seminar will start with “Eurasia,” a conceptual framework explored by several important artists in Europe and Asia in the twentieth-century, including Josef Beuys and Nam June Paik. This concept stretched beyond geographical definition of a continent or a specific locale; it rather suggested questions raised by these artists in response to the Cold War, intercontinental migration and connected practices of exhibitions and performances.
We will then discuss art and issues of belonging provoked by such well-known artists who live across continents, as Gonkar Gyatso, Tsherin Sherpa and Enkhbold. We will also read and discuss about recent biennales, including the 56th Venice Biennale, their participatory and inclusion policies. The seminar will include meeting and interviewing contemporary Asian artists in the Bay Area.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (B) and Chronological period (III).  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192T.1 | CCN: 33403

  Wednesday | 2:00 - 5:00pm"Psychologies of Art” will map important psychological, psychoanalytical, and pathological patterns in art, in the history of art, and in art theory from the late Middle Ages to the present day.
In the first third we will trace themes such as art and empathy, the psychological aspects of Christian art and iconography, the emotional implications of the maniera greca / maniera latina conflict, and the representation of emotions and psychological states between the middle ages and the early modern age.
The second third of the course will be focused on specific figures of depression and madness (such as Dante’s Count Ugolino in literature and in the visual arts, the emotional charge of figures in Giotto, the gender psychology of Botticelli’s paintings, Dürer’s Melancholia and her sisters, Michelangelo and the distancing self-analysis in some of his writings, and the rewriting of those themes in European art and thought (Lessing, Burke, Reynolds, Lavater, Warburg, Klibansky, Panofsky, Saxl).
The last third of the class prepares the issues of modernity and the “Ornament of the Masses” (Kracauer) through the question of fetishism, the new nineteenth-century concepts of childhood (Walter Benjamin), the history of art therapy and Gestalt psychology, Freud’s readings of Michelangelo’s works, Gombrich’s psychological perspectives, and the self-therapeutic works of Frida Kahlo.
Depending on students’ interests and disciplinary backgrounds, the acts of diagnostic early photography (Lombroso) will lead, on the one hand, to approaches in modern theory to images of suffering and the dead (Susan Sontag, Georges Didi-Huberman), and to the images, memory, and memorialization of modern catastrophes and their mass psychology on the other hand (Gerhard Richter’s September). On a parallel track to the last third of the class, the history of wars and military history painting, later military and war photography, offers views into the psychological impact through image-making of the American Civil War, Colonial Wars in British India, the avant-garde artists and poets in their relationship to World War One, Picasso’s iconographies of World War Two, and more recent examples from journalism as response to the undefeated act of reading in ruins (Cadava). Twentieth-century examples for student presentations can include advertisement and the atomic age as well as students’ takes on the psychologies of the contemporary art market in relation to examples from the historical phases studied in the seminar.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (E) and Chronological period (II) or (III), based on the topic of the final research paper or project.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192DH | CCN: 32898

  Thursday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThe Spanish born artist, who was active in Rome and Naples during the first half of the seventeenth-century, has left a series of works that are remarkable for their repetitiveness. Thumbnail photos of his oil paintings in catalogue raisonées betray obsessive repetition. This seminar will consider how figurative iteration, reversibility and material degradation in Ribera’s etchings provided an experimental practice. The seminar will also consider Ribera’s production in light of the late work of Caravaggio in Naples, Sicily and Malta, Ribera’s representation of torture and martyrdom, his graphic procedures, and the politics of representation in viceregal Naples, Imperial Spain and Colonial Latin America.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) or (C), based on the topic of the final research paper or project and Chronological period (II). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192G | CCN: 32043

  Wednesday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThis seminar explores art’s public presence in the United States from the late nineteenth century to the present. Class sessions will consider works ranging from monumental sculptures and murals to performances and ephemeral expression, focusing on how various audiences have understood, valued, and contested the “use” of art in their public lives. Through readings, discussions and visits to sites around the Bay Area, we will investigate how place and community might instantiated in, formulated through, or defamiliarized by artworks. We will also conduct hands-on sessions on commissioning processes, funding models, public critique, education and maintenance. Using the campus landscape, each student will conduct a project synthesizing course materials and independent research employing digital humanities techniques to reflect on how art can be made or remade in public.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (C) and Chronological period (III).Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 230 | CCN: 32044

  Wednesday | 10:00 - 1:00pmThis graduate seminar will focus on Dunhuang, the richest Buddhist cave site in China. Over the course of the semester, we will trace shifts in the design and construction of its nearly 400 devotional caves over a millennium, from the Northern Liang through the Yuan dynasties (4th-14th centuries), and think about how this single site could serve such a diverse, evolving Buddhist community. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which Dunhuang’s caves were experienced as complete sculptural and pictorial environments meant to answer practical programmatic needs and to enable new forms of Buddhist practice. We will also consider some of the vast body of ephemeral material—pictorial and textual—removed from the site’s famous Manuscript Cave and now in collections in Britain, France, India, China, and elsewhere. Students from the History of Art and related fields (East Asian Languages, History, Buddhist Studies) are all welcome.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 240 | CCN: 32045

  Friday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThis is an object-based course held under the auspices of the Mellon Curatorial Preparedness Program. It will focus on the bequest to U.C. Berkeley in 1997 of almost two dozen boxes of ancient artifacts by the distinguished classical archaeologist, architectural historian, and architect Norman Neuerburg (1926-1997): http://islapedia.com/index.php?title=NEUERBERG,_Norman; http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/18/news/mn-65517. These materials, which include Greek, Etruscan, and Roman pottery, terracottas, bronzes, and other artifacts, have never been studied and catalogued: this will be the task of our seminar. The agenda will include a funded 2-day field trip to Neuerburg’s architectural masterpiece and the repository of his personal papers, The Getty Villa.  Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192D | CCN: 34413   

    Koenraad Van Cleempoel
  Monday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThis course starts from the assumption that art and science where strongly related in the Renaissance, which we illustrate by studying a large corpus of scientific instruments, such as astrolabes, globes, sundials and armillary spheres. Representing the concept of ‘materialised knowledge’ we approach them both conceptually – as carriers of ideas – and materially. There is a particular emphasis on the ‘Northern Renaissance’ and the Flemish context: between c. 1525 and c. 1580 the university city of Louvain became Europe’s most important center for instrument making partly due to the research and technical skills of Gerard Mercator (1512-1594) and Gemma Frisius (1508-1555). This high reputation is due in equal measure to the combination of the beauty and the precision of these instruments. The decorative aspects took their inspiration from contemporary manuals by Antwerp artists, while their functional aspects embodied the most up-to-date knowledge of the time as distilled by contemporary mathematical practitioners. It is this perfect harmony of aesthetics and science that made the Louvain instruments so sought after in the European market. Many instruments were also sold in Antwerp via the Plantin Press to Spanish collectors. The newly built library of Philip’s II Escorial housed many Flemish instruments.The syllabus will also elaborate on representations of these instruments in paintings from the middle ages up to the 17th century, such as the Antwerp Cabinet interiors or the Rubens-Brueghel allegory of the senses, among others. This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (II).

  Tuesday | 9:30 - 12:30pmThis seminar will explore the early modern origins of three closely interrelated stylistic categories, the Gothic, grotesque, and arabesque, and the ways in which they engage with the perceived alterity of ornament.  Both the Gothic and grotesque were defined in terms of bodily deformity, femininity, perverse hybridity, and lack of regulation and control, and used to characterize the foreignness of the arabesque, and vice versa.  This course will interrogate the anxieties (and perhaps latent desires) underlying the formation and perception of these categories, including xenophobia, misogyny, and fear of the irrational and exotic.  We will closely examine illustrated books, prints, and buildings of the early modern world (e.g. France, Italy, colonial Latin America, South Asia).  The seminar will draw from other fields (such as anthropology and ethnomathematics) to consider the persistence of these categories in the uncontrollable reproduction and dissemination of ornament. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 290 | CCN: 15958   

    Whitney Davis, 
  Tuesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmBased on recent work by the instructor, the seminar develops and tests a comprehensive framework for analysis of pictoriality in the visual field, deploying certain traditions of art-historical reasoning in combination with intellectual resources drawn from philosophical psychology (especially the theory of depiction), visual studies, and phenomenological anthropology. Proceeding from a baseline distinction between images and pictures, it focuses on the matter of “imaging pictures”—that is, how pictures become visible, are “imaged” to have a particular “pictoriality,” in the visual field understood to be subject not only to invariant laws of geometrical optics but also to historically varying constructions of “the visible.” Special attention will be given to the famous proposition that “vision itself has a history.” Readings will be drawn largely from art theoretical and art historical literature, whether recent or not, that bears on these analytic considerations, but we will also address other models in present-day image studies. Student projects will investigate relevant historiographies, explore historical and cross-cultural variations in the imaging of pictures (i.e., particular historical constructions and contexts of pictorial bivisibility, bivirtuality, and birotationality), and/or test the strengths and weaknesses of the analytic model(s) in application to examples.Open to qualified undergraduates.

  Monday | 1:00 - 4:00pmThis graduate seminar will explore the ways in which forms of memory (personal, social, historical, etc.) have been recorded, made visual and material, contested and re-made in art and visual culture produced during critical times in Peruvian prehistory and history. Although Peru has long been the subject of studies by historians and archaeologists, Peruvian art history remains a small and emergent field with untapped potential. Seminar readings will be finalized based upon the interests of enrolled students, but will include case studies from pre-Hispanic art and archaeology, the survival and re-making of indigenous traditions and the fashioning of new criollo identities in a global context during the Spanish colonial era; uprisings and revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century; indigenismo and nationalism in the early and mid-twentieth century; and art and photography that addresses the violence of the 1980s and 90s and contemporary politics. International travel over spring break will be a required component of this seminar. Enrollment requires instructor approval. Priority for enrollment will be given to graduate students in South American art history and archaeology, as well as first- and second-year graduate students with other area specializations in art history. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 24 | CCN: 34046

  Monday | 11:00 - 12:00pmWhat does it mean to be a feminist now? What is feminism’s lineage? What does feminism look like? How can feminism teach us now? This course is designed to give students an introduction to key texts in feminist theory with an emphasis on their deployment in the visual arts.  In addition to reading and discussing these texts, students will be required to undertake feminist experiments in their daily lives. Assessment will be based on journal exercises.  Although the class is not limited to those identifying as women, major emphasis will be placed on implementing feminist strategies while identifying as female. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA N80 | CCN: 15543

  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday | 12:00 - 2:00PMThis course will offer a general overview of the history of twentieth-century art. We will begin with a brief look back into dominant trends of the nineteenth century and will conclude in the 1970s. Although many accounts of Modern Art tend to focus on US and European artists, we will also consider modernism in a global setting. The first three weeks tackle European modernism, week four shifts to the United States, and a global approach—which both builds upon and challenges the Eurocentric model—concludes the course. Through this course students will develop an understanding of the progression of modern art and the conditions for its development. Meets Arts & Literature, L&S Breadth

  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday | 10:00 - 12:00PMThis course introduces students to the major methodological and theoretical movements in art historical practice. Organized roughly chronologically, we begin with Vasari and artistic biography in the Renaissance, examine the origins of art historical scholarship in the eighteenth century, and then touch on a wide range of subsequent approaches, including Marxist, feminist, and post-colonial interpretations of art. The course emphasizes art history as a site of cultural critique and construction, contextualizing the various interventions in order to demonstrate their wider cultural relevance. As such, it asks students to reflect on the role of the discipline in today’s world. This class is required for majors in History of Art, but interested non-majors are invited to enroll as well. Meets Arts & Literature, L&S Breadth

  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday | 2:00 - 4:00PMDefine photography. Go ahead.Not as evident as it seems? One of the reasons may be the staggeringly quick evolution of the technology behind the production of pictures and the multiplicity of roles these images were/are made to play. The plurality indicated in the title of this course hints at the various avenues any class on photography could take as its narrative.This course, an introduction to the history of photography, will examine technological innovation. In that sense, chronology will matter. But beyond production, we will engage with how photography has been used, thinking about it thematically and conceptually. When, why, and how is photography political, commercial, scientific, and artistic? We will learn about photography’s pre-history and simultaneous invention(s) with Niepce and Daguerre; think about the photograph as document; consider its role in times of conflict and its relation to trauma; its subversive potential; what happens when color invades the frame; and the ubiquity and instant gratification of photography in today’s age of social networks and mobile devices.This course will rely heavily on visual analysis (give those eyes a workout!), description and argumentation. Readings will include both primary sources (artists’ and photographers’ statements) and essays by historians and theorists of photography (an average of 50 pages weekly). There will be short weekly reading responses and two longer essays, as well as creative assignments.
This is an introductory course with no prerequisites; however, English reading and writing skills must be developed enough to be able to meaningfully engage with images as well as complex theoretical readings. Participation in class is essential to success in this course.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (III).Meets Arts & Literature, L&S Breadth

  Wednesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmThis course explores representations of disability within Hebrew and Israeli culture. By focusing on literature, film, dance, and visual art, it looks at personal and socio-political conceptualizations of disability. This course pursues various applications of physical, mental, and emotional disability experiences and theories to Zionist, Jewish-Israeli narratives and rhetoric. Thus, while we will examine how the social context of disability in Israel affects representations of disability, we will also consider the ways in which disabled experiences and the notion of disability in general raise questions about Israeli subjectivity.
While in the past the experience of disability has been viewed as a condition of personal deficit and misfortune, our course will explore the work of writers, artists, scholars and activists, who have reinterpreted disability as a fact of life and a form of human variation. By discussing representations of people with disabilities, the course will provide in-depth analysis of: the roles and stereotypes of disabled figures in the Zionist movement, women with disabilities in Israeli Film, people with disabilities as artists and performers, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Israeli disabled dance and performance, disability and the Holocaust, images of madness and emotional distress in Hebrew literature, and Crip and alternative self-representations by artists with disabilities.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (D) and Chronological period (III).   Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 36 | CCN: 46143

  Tuesday | Thursday: 9:30 - 11:00amThis course offers an introduction to the art and architecture of modern South, Southeast, and East Asia from 1800 to the present. Asia, of course, is as vast as it is diverse. Keeping this in mind, this course will not attempt an encyclopedic survey of Asian art. Instead, using a comparative perspective, each week will focus on a set of case studies—the work of particular artists and art movements or the architecture of specific Asian cities—to reconstruct an expansive history of art and architecture in Asia. Examples will range from modern painting, sculpture, photography, and architecture to contemporary new media, performances, installations, and participatory art projects. Class lectures will be complemented by a close examination of collections of Asian art on campus and in the Bay Area. Simultaneously, taking advantage of the presence of numerous diasporic Asian artists in the area, we will venture outside of the classroom to track histories of modern and contemporary Asian art in our localities, neighborhoods, and communities.

  Tuesday | Thursday: 2:00 - 3:30pmThis course will cover two millennia of art produced in China to serve ritual purposes and will focus on the role that the visual arts played in defining doctrine and belief in two traditions: Daoism and Buddhism. Major themes will include the problems that early artists in China faced in their efforts to represent the sublime bodies of perfected Daoist immortals and the Buddha, and their translation of imported Buddhist images into legible Chinese forms. We will also consider the relationship of images to sacred texts, personal practice, public ritual, and political propaganda, the ongoing conversation between Daoist and Buddhist artists, the assimilation of Tibetan thought and modes of representation in China, and the effect of foreign rule and patronage on Chinese and Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhist art.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area  (B) and Chronological period (I) or (II), based on the topic of the  final research paper or project.   Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 162 | CCN: 46217

  Tuesday | Thursday: 12:30 - 2:00pmThis course surveys the rich production of art from Venice, 1450-1600. We will study the development of the particularly Venetian style of painting, from the innovations of Giovanni Bellini and the Arcadian painting of Giorgione, through the long and influential career of Titian, to the paintings of Veronese and Tintoretto, among others.  Our focus will be on visual dialog as we explore the interconnections of painting with architecture, sculpture, engravings, and woodcuts. We will read contemporary criticism and literature as we situate artwork in the social, religious, and urban contexts of the city.  The art production often reflects Venice’s role as the capital of an empire, uniquely positioned between other Italian centers, Northern Europe, and Mediterranean cities such as Istanbul.  Topics will include artists as travelers and diplomats; the role of patrons, institutions, and audience; innovations in methods and media; and iconographic enigmas and intellectual delight. Readings for the course will expose students to a variety of methodologies, including historical sociology, feminist critique, comparative formal analysis, iconography, and comparisons with poetry and music.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (A) and Chronological period (II). *This course will not hold discussion sections, but you must enroll in one to register for the lecture. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 186C | CCN: 46144

  Tuesday | Thursday: 3:30 - 5:00pm This lecture course provides a hemispheric overview of contemporary art—starting around 1960—with an emphasis on the contested relationship between art, audiences, and museums. We take the broadest possible definition of “American art” as we look at art spanning North, Central, and South America to think critically about the many movements and counter-movements that have emerged in countries like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States. We will consider art in times of political turmoil and dictatorship to think about image-making during times of censorship. How has art increasingly migrated beyond the walls of the gallery—into public spaces for instance, or onto the internet? We will look at practices that confront the conventional boundaries of the art object and challenge the traditional publics of art institutions. While close attention will be paid to site-specificity, activist art, feminist and queer performance, earthworks, and street interventions, we will also investigate how photography, painting, and sculpture have been reshaped by new viewers and display practices. We will also account for the effects of globalization and itinerancy as we trace how art, artists, and viewers travel across borders (both imaginatively and literally). This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (C) and Chronological period (III).Meets the Graduate Certificate in Global Urban Humanities elective requirement.   Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192A | CCN: 15120

  Thursday | 2:00 - 5:00pmBringing together maritime history, environmental humanities, and art history, this seminar will examine the social, cultural, and economic significance of oceanic waters. Our deliberations will be situated around the Indian Ocean, the third largest water body and the world’s oldest cultural continuum that has facilitated the mobility of people, objects, and ideas over millennia. Connecting Europe, South America, East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, East Asia, and South and Southeast Asia through maritime networks, Indian Ocean trade has long played an important role in world history. Our task will be to map out the ways in which such oceanic networks also shaped the global history of art. Our discussions will unfold through specific case studies: a ca. 3rd-century BCE Hellenistic bronze Poseidon unearthed in India, 10th-century Chinese ceramics excavated in East Africa, Indian textiles found in 11th-century Egypt, and ivory and silk exported to Mexico from Southeast Asia in the 16th century, to give a few examples. Visits to the Asian Art Museum and the Hearst Museum of Anthropology will allow for a hands-on study of objects and artifacts. This engagement will be complemented by a close reading of a variety of primary texts including travel accounts by Arab and European explorers and treatises on maritime navigation. We will conclude in the 1700s, when European trading companies came to dominate the Indian Ocean shipping routes, ushering in a globalized economy of extractive colonialism. Our aim in this seminar will be to trace an art history of the global before the beginning of modern globalization.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (B) and Chronological period (I) or (II), based on the topic of the final research paper or project.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 192CU.1 | CCN: 21873

  Thursday | 9:30 - 12:30pmOutside the continent, Africa is overwhelmingly imagined as a rural space, albeit one that can take different forms - a green savannah teeming with exotic animals; a dark jungle where danger lurks behind twisting vines; or an impoverished village inhabited by naked children who stand before thatched huts, their bare feet dusty and pleading eyes ringed with flies.These images both offer a reductive account of the African countryside and obscure the rich history of urban life on the continent. For millennia, large, cosmopolitan, wealthy cities have been sites of florescence in artistic and intellectual production. Today, African cities are hubs for thriving art scenes, many of which take the city itself as their primary subject. In this seminar, we will explore urban aesthetics through a close, multidisciplinary analysis of case studies drawn primarily from a West African axis spanning from Senegal to Nigeria. We will consider the following: How do African artists engage with and represent the city? How has art been used to define the urban, and to demarcate and define specific urban spaces? How is artistic production entangled with urban economies, politics, and spiritualities? Our inquiry will lead us to an examination of a wide range of objects, including architecture, maps, fashion, murals, statues, markets, festivals, music videos, and studio art.This course fulfills the following requirements for the History of Art major: Geographical areas (D) and Chronological period (III).

  Tuesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmIn this practice- and results-oriented seminar, in group work, team work, and individual research we will explore current cross-disciplinary scholarship (and relevant artifacts and archives) on seven topics commonly understood to bear on the question of "the origins of art": what is art and what is it for?; when (and how) did art "begin"? (non-human, pre-human, and prehistoric art); contemporary indigenous artistic expression ("traditional" arts in their contemporary moments); art and the brain; children's art; art and illness; the "end of art"?. Overall, we will emphasize (1) the interaction between theories of artistic origins and concrete practices in the visual and spatial arts; (2) the tensions and debates between scientific and humanistic approaches to the basic issues; (3) and the role of the discipline of art history in a much broader discourse that includes neuroscience, psychology, prehistory, aesthetics, art therapy, transnational art exhibition, and other forms of knowledge. In addition, we will identify and explore relevant campus, local, and online resources for studying and teaching the topics in question. Our collective goal will be to develop useful contexts and robust content for a new lower division course to be offered in Spring 2018 that could be broadly attractive to undergraduates all across campus, especially non-humanists, and that might also generate an ongoing online/virtual forum. Both graduate students and undergraduates have relevant backgrounds and stakes in this endeavor, and the seminar aims to find ways to actualize this.This course fulfills the following Major requirements: Geographical area (E) and Chronological period (III). Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 200 | CCN: 15075

  Wednesday | 2:00 - 5:00pmThe Proseminar is required of first-year PhD students in History of Art and is open to students from other programs interested in engaging with the visual. In the last three decades, a range of political and methodological interjections have substantively reshaped the idea of art history. If postcolonial theory and deconstruction have undermined the notion of a stable seeing and knowing subject, new methodologies such as sensory histories and digital humanities have expanded the scope and scale of what falls within the domain of art history. Where do we go from here? The thrust of this proseminar is both historiographic and pragmatic. Beginning with the Enlightenment and the birth of modern disciplinarity, we will track the histories, genealogies, methods, and debates that have shaped art history. We will pay close attention to authors and texts that have come to define the discipline. We will be equally attentive to voices that have remained outside of such (mostly western) exemplary discursive paradigms in order to tease out the global contours of art history. Debates in allied fields such as visual anthropology and cultural studies will also allow us to situate the questions and concerns of art history within a wide intellectual horizon. Then, moving from historiography to practice, we will attend to the pragmatics of fieldwork, grant writing, and archival research. Our aim will be not only to think critically about art history but also to interrogate our own subject position in relation to the field.

  Monday | 1:00 - 4:00pmThis seminar will grapple with the unique indeterminacy of the term “creole,” defined by one dictionary as: “ in the West Indies and parts of America- a. a native-born person of European, especially Spanish, ancestry; b. a native-born person of mixed European and African ancestry who speaks a French or Spanish creole; c. a native-born Black person as distinguished from one brought from Africa.” “Creole” thus describes white, black, or mixed-race persons, born not in Europe or Africa, but in the colonies. The term is colorblind, speaking instead to a shared displacement of persons from their (European and African) ancestral cultures to a foreign site where they were born. “Creole” binds unlike people on the basis of culture and history rather than biology: blacks and whites and people of mixed race who, because of the history of colonialism and slavery, share a geographic displacement from their genealogical and cultural origins. What first generation Creoles share is not being born where their parents were born. The word “Creole” implies that the condition of being born in the colonies determines identity in ways that supersede race, language, nation, and social status. It is a capacious and ambiguous term, referring to people of African, French, Spanish, and Portuguese descent (among others); to slaves and to slave-owners; to the colonized and to colonizers.  Creoles were simultaneously relatives of Africans and Europeans and foreigners in relation to them.“Creole” also signifies cultural invention, the fabrication of a new culture that distances Europeans and Africans alike from their original “pure” identity.  “Creolization” was, in the words of FrançoiseVergès, “the process whereby individuals of different cultures, languages, and religions were thrown together and invented a new language, Creole, a new culture, and a new social organization.” Yet “Creole” also raised the specter of cultural inferiority, the assimilation of whites and blacks and the possibility of irreversible racial degeneration. For centuries, the French ascribed these contradictory and shifting attributes to Creoles who were sometimes their relatives,Bearing in mind the historically and geographically shifting French definitions of Creole, this seminar will examine painting and prints and will put special emphasis on the genre of portraiture. Case studies include the illustrated 18th-century history of Saint-Domingue by the Martiniquan Moreau de Saint-Méry; representations of the Haitian Revolution, especially its violence and military officers; depictions of and by Caribbean men and women “of color” living in Paris, such as the novelist Alexandre Dumas père (who was continually caricatured), the painters Guillaume Guillon Lethière and Théodore Chasseriau, and Baudelaire’s lover Jeanne Duval portrayed by both Courbet and Manet; and Edgar Degas’s portraits of his Creole family in New Orleans. Key to our examination will be the history of slavery; the “social death” of persons deemed objects; constructions of race; the historical tensions between black slaves and people of color; abolitionist iconography; revolution; violence, trauma, and the disaggregation of bodies; caricature; the vexed status of the Creole family; miscegenation, filiation, illegitimacy, and incest; and the borders between the animate and inanimate.I am now completing my book Creole Looking and we will read much of my writing as I hope to benefit from your thinking. But we will also read a lively pertinent literature by authors such as Moreau de Saint-Méry, Lafcadio Hearn, Hegel, Frantz Fanon, Saidiya Hartman, Joan Dayan, Françoise Vergès, Paul Gilroy, Stuart Hall, Orlando Patterson, Doris Garraway, Benedict Anderson, Monique Allewaert, Sibylle Fischer, and Caribbean theorists of Creolité such as Edouard Glissant, Patrick Chamoiseau and Raphaël Confiant. I encourage students to read my book Extremities. Painting Empire in post-Revolutionary France (2002) this summer as we will discuss it at our second meeting.

  Wednesday | 9:00 - 12:00pmWe art historians know to interrogate "history" and the ways we draw connections between past events, persons, and things, but how might we also interrogate accounts of the future? This course explores a number of future-oriented speculations in the practices and theories of twentieth and twentieth-century art worlds, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which future-making is not an evenly distributed good, yet the futurity of art--configured in a variety of different ways--has time and again been claimed to counter the amnesias of empire, colonialism, and social death. At other junctures, of course, appeals to the future have worked to perform and expand the threat of forgetting, with troubling results. Case studies for consideration will include historical Futurist projects in Italy, North Africa, South America, and elsewhere, 1960s cybernetic projects in both market centers and so-called peripheries, the critical aesthetics of Afrofuturism, and the hallucinatory optimism of Gulf Futurism, among others. Meets the Graduate Certificate in Global Urban Humanities elective requirementHigher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA Design  HA 375 | CCN: 14987

  Tuesday | 2:00 - 4:00pmThis class is both a pedagogy course and a pre-professional workshop. It will encourage you to think both broadly and pragmatically about the function of pedagogy in art history in particular: what we learn, how we teach, and who we are as teachers in this field. You will develop strategies to lead sections and to grade papers and exams effectively. We will discuss strategies to help students think and write in visual terms, to guide them to a more critical mode of reading, to mentor them in independent research, and to ensure that they work to the best of their potential. We will spend time learning about resources on campus to support student learning, undergraduate research, undergraduate-graduate mentoring, teaching assessment, and to strengthen equity, diversity, and inclusion in the classroom.This class is also designed to help you envision and plan what your own teaching will be like when you are designing and instructing courses. Throughout the semester, you will develop a syllabus, paper assignments, exams, and part of a first lecture for a class that you would like to teach some day in your field. Your final project will be a teaching portfolio, which will incorporate this work and a “teaching statement” explaining your personal philosophy of teaching. We will also talk about the formation and development of our academic identities as scholars and teachers, as you begin to look ahead to the job market.This seminar satisfies a University-wide requirement that all first-time Graduate Student Instructors take a pedagogy course. It can be taken concurrently with a first teaching assignment or in the semester before beginning teaching. This course is designed for doctoral students in History of Art but is open to students from other programs as well.Instructor approval required.

  Wednesday | 9:00 - 12:00pmThis seminar will focus on the politics of French art during a period characterized by multiple revolutions and regimes changes (the Bourbon monarchy, the Revolution of 1789, the Napoleonic empire, the Bourbon monarchy’s restoration, the Revolution of 1830, the Revolution of 1848, and Napoleon III’s coup d’état of 1851). This violent period of political and cultural upheaval witnessed extraordinary transformations in French art. While this art has often been interpreted in terms of stylistic change (Rococo to Classicism to Romanticism), it has also inspired a major methodological shift in the history of art: “the social history of art” began with the seminal work of T.J. Clark in the 1970s and that of his student Thomas Crow in the 1980s. We will examine this literature, focusing on the relation between artistic and social change, considering not only political and institutional pressures upon artists, but also the shifting conceptions of art’s purpose and audience. Crucial too will be this period’s shifting constructions of gender, sexuality, nation, race, slavery, and empire.

From fall 2013, graduate seminars have had more museum, collection, and site visits within the context of their graduate seminars, and a new course has been designed and offered on object analysis in museum conservation studios and sites of production. Two other core graduate courses focus on Material Culture studies and on exhibitions. Additionally, each semester advanced graduate students have had the opportunity to intern in museum collections rich in the materials that form the focus of their special expertise: in 2013-14 Laure Marest-Caffey was in the Department of The Art of the Ancient World at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and William Ma was at the Peabody-Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts in the Department of Asian Export Art. In the spring of 2015 Kappy Mintie was in the Department of Photography at the Amon Carter Museum and Sasha Rossman in the Department of Drawings and Prints at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. Currently (fall 2015) Emma Silverman is interning at LACMA in contemporary art and Elaine Yau is in the Visual Collections of the Bancroft Library. In Spring semester 2016 Jessica Stair will be interning in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum and Elizabeth MacFadden will be in the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. U.C. students are currently producing an exhibition that will open in May 2016 using Berkeley’s far-ranging object collections. The purpose of the Mellon initiative is to give students greater flexibility in career direction, and to enrich their art historical research with knowledge of materials and workmanship, with stronger links to museum collections and staff, and with a broader intellectual toolbox.Please join us for "Return of Ten Thousand Dharmas: A Celebration in …Lawrence Alloway: Critic and Curator (Getty Research Institute), which …History of Art Commencement exercises will take place on Tuesday, May 16 at …Students who participated in a special curatorial component of the course …Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignInstructors: Beate Fricke, Diliana Angelova, 
  This past year's Travel seminar involved a weeklong intensive tour of the city's monuments, both ancient and modern, journeyed across the city's most historic neighborhoods, from the old Sultanahmet district---home to Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and the immense Sultan Ahmed Mosque---to the former Italian citadel of Galata over the Golden horn.  The seminar's key themes revolved around Byzantine frescoes, architectural effects of iconoclasm, both Christian and Muslim; the relationship between Byzantine and Ottoman design; trans-Mediterranenan travel and trade; and Republican modernaization. Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignInstructors: Andrew Stewart, Christopher Hallett, 
  This years trip to Italy gave students the opportunity to explore the remains of the luxrious past of the Roman elite.The seminar's theme reflected the interests of the ancient Roman "one percent": the acquisition and display of expensive luxury goods, extravagant villa culture, and an abiding love of Hellenistic art and literature. Some of the sites that were visited included the House of Faun, Herculaneum, the Villa of the Papyri, and the Cave at Sperlonga.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignInstructors: Elizabeth Honig, Margaretta Lovell, 
  The seminar to England gave students an opportunity to visit some of the great Tudor Homes such as Penshurst, Hampton Court, Burghley House, Little Moreton Hall and Bolsover Castel. Students learned of the craftmanship, early modern technologies, hospitality and nature-based designs of the Neo-Tudor Period. Students worked on research topics as diverse as the neo Tudor design in American suburbia to the reformation of the country house chapel.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignInstructors: Todd Olson, 
  The Spring 2012 seminar began as a graduate reading group in Fall 2011 that examined the mutual impact of the visual cultures of early modern Spain and colonial Latin America. The working assumption was that understanding a painter such as Velázquez or an anonymous 17th-century Mexican artist is inextricable from an understanding of a history of the global migration of images and artifacts. The seminar entailed a ten-day intensive examination of Spanish and Latin American art held in British and Spanish collections. In London we visited the British Museum’s Department of Prints and Drawings, meeting with the keeper of Spanish drawings and prints, the National Gallery and Apsley House. In Madrid the seminar explored the city (including the Plaza del Sol, the Plaza Mayor, the Palacio Real, and the Iglesia de San Ginés). On the first full day in the city the participants met in front of Velázquez’s Las Meninas at the Prado to begin our ten-hour exploration of the museum’s impressive collection. The graduate students also studied works in the Museo de América, which holds an impressive collection of colonial Latin American art: Casta paintings, feather work, Virgins of Guadalupe, enconchados (works of inlaid mother of pearl), and a crowned nun are but a few of the many fascinating objects that became the basis for research papers. The seminar also enjoyed informal conversations over coffee with Dr. Luisa Elena (Coco) Alcalá, Professor of Art History at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and went on a special tour led by Dr. Miguel Falomir, Head of the Department of Italian Renaissance Painting at the Prado, of the Casón del Buen Retiro, which boasts a ceiling fresco by Luca Giordano. In addition there were visits to the Museo Thyssen Bornemisza, the Museo Reina Sofia, the Convento de las Descalzas Reales, and the Escorial. Some participants conducted research in the Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid and the Museo Municipal de Antequera in the south of Spain.Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignIf your interests include art and travel, Berkeley's History of Art Department has a fine tradition of graduate travel seminars, research around the world and participation in international symposiums.The Travel Seminar is made possible by a generous gift to the department from the Estate of Judith Lee Stronach.

At least six of these must be seminars taken with five different faculty members in the Department. History of Art 200, the Proseminar, is required of all entering students, regardless of any previous historiography or methodology classes. History of Art 300, Teaching for GSIs , is required for all Graduate Student Instructors.

Post-MA students are expected to take six seminars, four of which must be in the History of Art department. They must also take the Proseminar. History of Art 375, Teaching for GSIs, is required for all Graduate Student Instructors.Two languages other than English as determined in consultation with their faculty advisor.  Newly admitted students are encouraged to discuss with their planned advisor which languages are most suitable for their program of study. In some cases, summer study before the fall of Year One is recommended.The language requirements may be satisfied in three ways : 
(1) At least one language requirement must be met by passing the departmental language examination;
(2) One language requirement may be met by passing an advanced literature course in the source language with a grade of  B or better,
(3) One language requirement may be met by two years of college-level coursework in the language with grades of “B” or better taken in the previous five years.  The final course in the sequence must be taken at Berkeley.Departmental Language Exams
The departmental language exams are given three times a year: the week before classes begin in the fall and spring semesters, and during the last week of spring semester.  No language exams are given during the summer.  Each exam is two and a half hours long and consists of two passages. The first passage is approximately 200 words, which must be translated into idiomatic, accurate English.  The second passage is approximately 600 words and must be summarized into an English paragraph of approximately 200 words. Sample exams are available in the department office.All incoming graduate students must sit for at least one exam the week before their first semester.Students who fail a language exam are required to retake the exam each time it is offered until a passing score is achieved.  Students who fail the language exam that they take when they first arrive are expected to enroll in courses during their first semester and continue taking courses until the departmental examination is passed.Procedure:Students beginning stage two prepare a written proposal defining the scope, approach, and rationale of the dissertation. The student now formalizes the choice of dissertation advisor(s), who consult on the preparation of the prospectus, helping the student devise a plan of study toward the Ph.D. Qualifying Exam.  (see Appendix D. for “Guidelines on Writing a Dissertation Prospectus,”)  Further discussions and suggestions take place at a colloquium, scheduled four to six months prior to the qualifying examination.  The Colloquium Committee, nominated by the student and approved by the Graduate Advisor, consists of two or more faculty members from History of Art and one or more from an outside department (all must be members of the Berkeley Academic Senate) for a total of four members. At the colloquium, the examination’s exact scope is reviewed and determined. This involves selecting a general field for the exams, special topics, and a related outside subject, providing the appropriate background for dissertation research.The examination is conducted by a five-member committee nominated by the student and advisors. Paperwork must be filed with the Graduate Division prior to the Qualifying exam; please see the Graduate Student Services Advisor for the appropriate forms.  The committee is normally the Colloquium Committee plus a chair chosen by the student. The exam has two parts: a four hour written portion and an oral examination, held approximately one week later. The examination tests the student’s basic knowledge of a general field, detailed knowledge of special topics within it, and the ability to integrate studies in an appropriate outside field with work in the History of Art.  [See Appendix E in the Departmental Handbook, “Guidelines for the Qualifying Examination for the Ph.D. in History of Art.”] Upon passage of the qualifying exam, students must immediately file for doctoral candidacy with the Graduate Division. Please see the Graduate Student Services Advisor for the appropriate paperwork. All students must advance to candidacy by June 30 of their fourth year. Exceptions to any of the stated requirements concerning membership on a Colloquium, Qualifying Exam, or Dissertation Committee must be approved by the Graduate Advisor.Click here for Graduate Division's definition of the Qualifying Examination.The dissertation is a book-length study of a problem in the history of art.  The dissertation is written under the supervision of a committee nominated by the graduate advisor in consultation with the student.  The committee consists of three Academic Senate members from the Berkeley campus.  One committee member must be from an outside department. Dissertation chapters should be submitted to the committee, together with appropriate illustrations, as they are written.  The committee must receive the entire dissertation, including illustrations, at least three months before the filing deadline.Annual Review of Ph.D. CandidatesAll dissertation stage doctoral students must meet annually with at least two members of the committee to review and evaluate dissertation progress and plan for the next year.  Students who are not in residence are expected to do this via email or videoconference.  The Head Graduate Advisor will request an annual report on progress that is put together by the graduate student in consultation with their dissertation chair. Please join us for "Return of Ten Thousand Dharmas: A Celebration in …Lawrence Alloway: Critic and Curator (Getty Research Institute), which …History of Art Commencement exercises will take place on Tuesday, May 16 at …Students who participated in a special curatorial component of the course …Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignThe Department of History of Art offers a two-stage integrated master's  and doctoral program (MA/PhD) in preparation for college teaching,  writing, and specialized curatorial careers. Students are not admitted  to work for a terminal MA degree, though students may apply for the MA  after meeting Stage I requirements toward the PhD.

Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Advisor at any time during the fall and spring semesters. Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year. Transfer students should plan to take two history of art courses in their first semester. Students need to establish their area of focus by the second semester of their junior year. Advantages of Declaring Early
Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy both a more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with multiple members of the faculty, as well as greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters and Science (L&S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special programs of study, e.g., study abroad, internships, independent study, a double major, and the Honors Program.

The focus must be approved by an Undergraduate Faculty Advisor.Examples include (but are not limited to): The Ancient World                           Art and GenderThe Renaissance World                  Modernities and the ArtsThe Body in Art                                Globalism and the ArtsArt and Religion                               Urban CulturePopular Culture                               Material Culture Advising and Appointments with Major AdvisorsDeclared majors must see an Undergraduate Advisor, in person each semester during the registration period (advisors are listed on the Department website and in the Department office). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisors also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisors are typically not available during the official University holidays or recesses. Advising appointments can be made by signing up online:http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisors must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses (History of Art 193, 194, H195, 199), and some special programs.Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines (e.g. course enrollment). To make the most efficient use of advising appointments for course enrollment, students should consider carefully the department’s course descriptions, and plan a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the advisor. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisors may decline to provide last-minute advising. Advisor codes will only be given out over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is unable to come to campus for reason of a serious emergency. Departmental Undergraduate Advisors do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters and Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&S advisor in 206 Evans Hall.Transfer of CreditUndergraduate Advisors may credit courses taken at other institutions toward completion of the History of Art major at UC Berkeley. This process is independent of the transfer of credit toward completion of L&S requirements for graduation. Transfer students should come to their first departmental advising appointment with copies of transcripts from all institutions they have attended previously as well as information about the content and requirements of the courses they wish to transfer. Courses taken at community colleges may only fulfill Lower Division requirements for the History of Art major. Coursework from other universities or 4-year colleges may be considered for Upper Division major requirements. Please note as well the residency requirements under “Special Restrictions for all Majors.”UC Berkeley Summer Session Courses and Major RequirementsTwo Summer Session lecture courses—in History of Art or for the requirement of one course taught outside the department—and an Art Practice course may be credited to completion of the major. Approval of Other CoursesOn occasion, courses taught in other departments may fulfill major requirements with the approval in advance by a History of Art Undergraduate Advisor. Grades and CreditsLetter Grade: All courses to be counted toward completion of the Major, with the exception of the Art Practice requirement which may only be taken Pass/Not Pass, must be taken for a letter grade, earning a C- minus or higher. Majors must attain at least a C (2.0) average overall in all of the courses required in the major program.Declaring the History of Art Major: Prior to declaring the major, students must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course.AP Credit: Course credit may be given to students who receive a score of four or five on the Advanced Placement (AP) Examination in History of Art. This credit may be used to satisfy one lower division course requirement.ResidencyA minimum of five upper division courses must be taken in the History of Art Department at Berkeley, of which one must be a 4-unit seminar. L&S requirements note that you must complete a minimum of 18 units of upper division courses (excluding study abroad units), 12 of which must satisfy the requirements for this major.Note that after you become a senior (with 90 semester units earned) you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence in at least two semesters; there is a Modified Senior Residence Requirement for participants in EAP/Non-EAP or UCB-DC programs. See L&S Residency Requirements for details.Suggestions for All Majors       Foreign languages Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of a foreign language. Study of one or more languages may also be useful to various arts related jobs.      Course loads vary but students should be aware that 15 units is considered a normal load; 13 units is the minimum for a full time student. AppealsIf, at any time, a student has a complaint, the Department has an “Undergraduate Appeals Procedure” which should be followed. A copy of this procedure may be obtained from the Undergraduate Assistant or at Appeals to the Deans' Conference. Its purpose is to permit students in the History of Art Department to resolve complaints at the department level prior to filing complaints pursuant to the Berkeley Campus Student Grievance Procedure. On Tuesday, May 2nd, History of Art undergraduate Ariana Pemberton will …Please join us for "Return of Ten Thousand Dharmas: A Celebration in …Three students in History of Art have been awarded Undergraduate Merit …Lawrence Alloway: Critic and Curator (Getty Research Institute), which …Higher Education Web Development by WebvantaDesign by Francisco Aveledo, FA DesignStudents who declare the major in History of Art from the Fall 2017 semester will complete requirements in the redesigned major shown under the Fall 2017+ tab. Those who declared prior to the Fall 2017 semester will complete requirements under the previous major, listed on this page. The Major in History of Art is designed to give students a solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses—Lower division, Upper Division, Seminar, and Honors Program—the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics, while allowing flexibility for students to their pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.

44-52 units total

I. LOWER DIVISION (4 courses)

A. Three History of Art Courses (9-12 units)

Majors must complete 9 to 12 units of Lower Division course work in the History of Art.
