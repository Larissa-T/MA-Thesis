There will be talks on philosophical topics (one main lecture and some shorter, more ‘degree specific’ ones), a general admissions-related talk and a chance to talk to students already at Oxford.  You can find out more about the courses on the Undergraduate Admissions pages of the university website.The event will be on Saturday 6th May 2017, from mid-morning to mid-afternoon.  Registration will be from 10.30am, and the formal programme will be over by 2.45pm, though we hope that some staff and students may be around for a little longer to field any remaining questions informally. Please fill out the registration form if you wish to attend.The event will be held in the Andrew Wiles Building, an excellent new space next door to the Philosophy Faculty, and which is home to the Mathematical Institute.The event is principally aimed at those in school year 12, who are thinking of applying to university next academic year. It doesn’t matter whether you are taking A levels; you could be taking the IB, pre-U qualifications, or other courses which would be suitable for university entrance.  You certainly do not need to be studying philosophy at present, or philosophical subjects studied under other labels – these are not an entrance requirement for any of our degrees.We have agreed with our friends in the Maths Institute security staffing cover for a limit of 150 attendees, so sadly in order to make this open to as many potential students as possible we will have to restrict entry just to them. Please fill out the registration form if you wish to attend. This means that we cannot accommodate parents or teachers. There are, of course, many attractions in Oxford for family members who might be in the city for the day!Open Day Registration FormUniversity Open DaysTravel and parking adviceFinding the Philosophy FacultyIf you are interested in one of these degree programmes, and are on target to achieve results in your current qualifications at the level indicated, then yes, absolutely.  We’ll be pleased to see you, and hope you’ll find the day interesting.  A quick summary can’t cover all of the nuances of the full prospectus, but this table gives an idea:DegreeEssentialRecommendedHelpful (not required)Standard Offer GradesLiterae HumanioresCourse I (only): Latin and/or Greek  AAA, IB 39 (666 at higher level)Philosophy & Modern LanguagesA modern language for chosen course  AAA, IB 39 (666 at higher level)Philosophy & Theology  Essay-based subjectAAA, IB 39 (666 at higher level)Philosophy, Politics & Economics  Mathematics, HistoryAAA, IB 39 (666 at higher level)Computer Science & PhilosophyMathematicsFurther Mathematics or a scienceAn essay-based subjectA*AA, IB 39 (766 at higher level)Mathematics & PhilosophyMathematicsFurther Mathematics A*A*A, IB 39 (766 at higher level)Physics & PhilosophyPhysics, MathematicsMechanics module in MathsFurther Mathematics, Arts subjectA*AA, IB 39 (766 at higher level)Psychology, Philosophy & Linguistics Mathematics, science subjectsEnglish language (for Linguistics)A*AA, IB 39 (766 at higher level) There’s a version of Literae Humaniores, Course 2, which does not require classical languages to A level (or an equivalent level in other qualifications); there are some modern languages which can be studied as a ‘beginner’ in Philosophy and Modern Languages.  For either, you’ll still need to have an aptitude for languages!  In Psychology, Philosophy & Linguistics (PPL) you apply for just two of the three subjects, and each pair has a separate course code, which is very different from Philosophy, Politics & Economics (PPE) where you apply for all three (though you can study just two from second year onwards).  For some degrees there will be a requirement to get an A* or equivalent in a specific subject; Physics and Philosophy will want an A* in Physics, Mathematics or Further Mathematics (or 7 at higher level on the IB in Maths or Physics).  Standard offer grades are listed for A levels and the International Baccalaureate, but can be found on-line for many other qualifications.Sadly we cannot provide overnight accommodation for the event, which we appreciate will make it difficult for those from further away to come. We are investigating recording some of the talks so that they can be viewed more widely at a later date.Lunch will not be provided, and the café in the building is shut at the weekend, but there will be an area indoors to eat a packed lunch if you bring your own food, and we hope there will be current students around to talk to.  There are a few local eateries, but the time allocated for lunch may make it difficult to get very far from the building and return in time for the afternoon sessions.Data protectionWe will need to take and store some personal details to handle your booking.  Because we plan to have degree-specific sessions in the afternoon it would be useful to know, to give an idea of numbers for room allocation, which degree you’re most interested in.  So we need your permission to use some specific information for the event. Please fill out the registration form if you wish to attend.We also ask you for a few further details, which do not directly affect the running of this event but are part of a cooperative endeavour to help develop a wider picture of access to Higher Education.  You may well be asked for the same information from a number of universities for the same purpose.  See http://heat.ac.uk/It makes no difference in applying for the Open Day whether you give this further data and your permission, and you won’t benefit personally by letting the data be used.  However, future generations across the whole of UK education may benefit from our ability to track the usefulness of various types of training and events from school right the way through to getting established in a career.  So we’d be very grateful for your help.Oxford UniversityOxford's ResearchFees and fundingLibrariesMuseums and CollectionsOpen daysOxford GlossaryProspective undergraduatesProspective graduate studentsCurrent Oxford studentsCurrent Oxford staffVisitors/TouristsMediaAlumniTeachersBusinesses/PartnershipsContact searchJobs and VacanciesTerm datesMapGiving to OxfordMedieval and modern history has been studied at Oxford for longer than at almost any other university: a Regius Professor of Modern History was first appointed in 1724, and undergraduate examinations began in 1850.The History Faculty has more than 90 permanent academic staff. Of these, 15 are statutory Professors, or Readers. The majority of permanent academic staff, are joint appointees whose teaching responsibilities encompass both the Faculty and the individual college of appointment. The Faculty also encompasses at any one time a number of historians employed by colleges – College Lecturers and short-term Junior Research Fellows – as well as those on fixed-term employment with the Faculty: Departmental Lecturers providing teaching for postholders on research leave, and research assistants on funded research projects. Its wider membership includes colleagues in a number of other faculties and departments across the University who work as historians or in closely cognate disciplines.The University of Oxford is one of the world's most encompassing centres for the study of history. The faculty has nearly twelve hundred undergraduates, and almost five hundred graduate students attracted from around the world.In this history lecture series Professor Stephen Gunn look at the effects of war on the people of England in the 1500s. This lecture series was recorded in Hilary Term 2015 and is part of the annual James Ford Lectures in British History series at the Examination Schools in Oxford University.More podcasts relating to the Faculty of HistoryWhen Martin Luther nailed a sheet of paper to the church door of a small university town on 31 October 1517, he set off a process that changed the Western world for ever.Luther’s ideas spread like wildfire. His attack on the Church soon convulsed Germany, divided Europe and polarised people’s beliefs. They triggered decades of religious persecution, social unrest and war. And in the long run, his ideas paradoxically helped break the grip of religion in every sphere of life.But the man who started the Reformation was deeply flawed. He was a religious fundamentalist, a Jew-hater and a political reactionary. He was a fervent believer who was tormented by doubt, a brilliant writer who shaped the German language and a vicious and foul-mouthed polemicist. He was a married ex-monk who liberated human sexuality from the stigma of sin, but also a man who insisted that women should know their place. For him the Devil was not just a figure of speech but a very real and physical presence. In this first historical biography for many decades, distinguished historian Lyndal Roper gives us a flesh-and-blood figure, warts and all. She reveals the often contradictory psychological forces that drove Luther forward – insecurity and self-righteousness, anger and humility – and the dynamics they unleashed which turned a small act of protest into a battle against the power of the Church.More publications from the Faculty of HistoryThe Oxford Centre for Global History was established by the History Faculty in June 2011 to reflect its strong commitment to the field. Global History in Oxford is defined broadly as the global movement of people, goods, and ideas and the consequences that flow from them. Chronologically, it extends across all historical periods from ancient to late modern.The Centre is particularly keen to encourage cooperation between historians of different periods, as well as places, in the study of themes of global significance. It will support research projects, and host workshops, seminars, and conferences. A key part of the Centre’s role is to facilitate the research of all those in Oxford who are keen to develop a global history dimension in their work. http://global.history.ox.ac.ukMore recent research projects and centres from the Faculty of HistoryFor more information, visit the History Faculty websiteUndergraduate coursesUniversity websiteGraduate coursesUniversity websiteResearchLink to faculty websiteAcademic staffLink to faculty websiteOxford UniversityOxford's ResearchFees and fundingLibrariesMuseums and CollectionsOpen daysOxford GlossaryProspective undergraduatesProspective graduate studentsCurrent Oxford studentsCurrent Oxford staffVisitors/TouristsMediaAlumniTeachersBusinesses/PartnershipsContact searchJobs and VacanciesTerm datesMapGiving to OxfordEstablished in 2008 (but looking back to several centuries of linguistic studies at Oxford), the Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics is the youngest Faculty within the Humanities Division. With its research and teaching profile which encompasses Theoretical Linguistics, Experimental Linguistics, and Historical and Comparative Linguistics it offers a uniquely stimulating and diverse academic environment. Among its 20 postholders there are specialists in Phonology, Phonetics, Semantics, Syntax, Psycholinguistics, Sociolinguistics, the linguistics of all major European languages, as well as Classical and Indo-European Comparative Philology.The Faculty is housed in the Centre for Linguistics and Philology, which occupies part of the former Clarendon Press Institute on the east side of Walton Street. Most graduate courses in Linguistics and Philology are held in the building, and offices for both academic and administrative staff are also located here; facilities for graduate students include a common room, computer workstations and printing and photocopying equipment.The Faculty also maintains two Laboratories for experimental research, the Language and Brain Laboratory for Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics and the Phonetics Laboratory. Both of these are situated in a separate building in the immediate vicinity of the Centre for Linguistics and Philology.The Language and Brain Laboratory was established in 2008 as part of the Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics. It is an active research laboratory covering all aspects of linguistics, including phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics.

The Faculty offers expertise in French, German, Italian, Modern Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Polish and Czech, as well as in a range of other languages spoken in Europe. Colleagues across the various languages work together in various interdisciplinary projects and research centres, which bring specialists in language and literature together with historians, philosophers, and social studies scholars.The Faculty is divided into seven sub-faculties: French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and other Slavonic Languages, Spanish and Modern Greek. It includes 9 established professorships as well as 15 individuals with the title of professor and 80 permanent academic post holders. The colleges, which are responsible for undergraduate admissions and undergraduate tutorial teaching, admit a total of about 270 students a year to read for the Honour School of Modern Languages and its joint schools with Classics, English, History, Philosophy, Oriental Studies, and Linguistics. The Modern Languages Faculty Board is responsible for the admission and supervision of graduate students. There are about 60 graduates taking taught Masters degrees, and about 120 research students.This conference brings together an outstanding panel of scholars and experts in Mesoamerican studies.

Diderot was the editor of the Encyclopédie, that Trojan horse of Enlightenment ideas, as well as a novelist, playwright, art critic and philosopher. His Letter on the Blind of 1749 is essential reading for anyone interested in Enlightenment philosophy or eighteenth-century literature because it contradicts a central assumption of Western literature and philosophy, and of the Enlightenment in particular, namely that moral and philosophical insight is dependent on seeing. Kate Tunstall’s essay guides the reader through the Letter, its anecdotes, ideas and its conversational mode of presenting them, and it situates the Letter in relation both to the Encyclopedie and to a rich tradition of writing about and, most importantly, talking and listening to the blind.More publications from the Faculty of Medieval and Modern LanguagesFind publications in different languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, Modern Greek, CzechThis project proposes for the first time to use the traded objects themselves, 15th-century books which still survive in their thousands, as essential and unquestionable evidence of the booktrade, to substantially complement current research on the booktrade based almost solely on scattered documentary evidence (printers contracts, litigations, booksellers stock lists, wills etc.).For more information, visit the Medieval and Modern Languages Faculty websiteUndergraduate coursesUniversity websiteGraduate coursesUniversity websiteResearchLink to faculty websiteAcademic staffLink to faculty websiteOxford UniversityOxford's ResearchFees and fundingLibrariesMuseums and CollectionsOpen daysOxford GlossaryProspective undergraduatesProspective graduate studentsCurrent Oxford studentsCurrent Oxford staffVisitors/TouristsMediaAlumniTeachersBusinesses/PartnershipsContact searchJobs and VacanciesTerm datesMapGiving to OxfordThe Faculty of Classics encompasses research and teaching in all aspects of ancient Greece and Rome, and their neighbours.

In particular biographies offer important insights into the dynamics underlying ancient performance of the self and social behaviour, issues currently of crucial importance in classical studies. They also raise complex issues of narrativity and fictionalization. This volume examines a range of ancient texts which are or purport to be biographical and explores how formal narrative categories such as time, space and character are constructed and how they address (highlight, question, thematize, underscore or problematize) the borderline between historicity and fictionality. In doing so, it makes a major contribution not only to the study of ancient biographical writing but also to broader narratological approaches to ancient texts.More Publications from the Faculty of Classics.This Leverhulme Trust-funded project, running from 2016 to 2019, is undertaking the first systematic study of the concept of anachronism in Greco-Roman antiquity and of the role played by the idea of anachronism in the formation of the concept of antiquity itself.The project, led by Professor Tim Rood and Professor John Marincola, looks at both classical and modern material, pairing close analysis of surviving literary and material evidence from classical antiquity with detailed study of the post-classical term ‘anachronism’, and with modern theoretical writings that link the notion of anachronism with the conceptualization of antiquity. More Research Projects and Centres from the Faculty of ClassicsFor more information, visit the Classics Faculty websiteUndergraduate coursesUniversity websiteGraduate coursesUniversity websiteResearchLink to faculty websiteAcademic staffLink to faculty websiteOxford UniversityOxford's ResearchFees and fundingLibrariesMuseums and CollectionsOpen daysOxford GlossaryProspective undergraduatesProspective graduate studentsCurrent Oxford studentsCurrent Oxford staffVisitors/TouristsMediaAlumniTeachersBusinesses/PartnershipsContact searchJobs and VacanciesTerm datesMapGiving to OxfordOxford’s English Faculty is the largest in Britain, and one of the most illustrious Schools of English in the world.

At any one time, there are roughly a thousand students studying within the Faculty at undergraduate level, and another three hundred at graduate level in the largest English graduate school in the country.Traditionally teaching and research in the Faculty has covered the entire history of literature in English from the Anglo-Saxon period to the present day, along with language studies. More recent growth areas include world literature and film studies.Each lecture in this series focuses on a single play by Shakespeare, and employs a range of different approaches to try to understand a central critical question about it. Rather than providing overarching readings or interpretations, the series aims to show the variety of different ways we might understand Shakespeare, the kinds of evidence that might be used to strengthen our critical analysis, and, above all, the enjoyable and unavoidable fact that Shakespeare's plays tend to generate our questions rather than answer them.More podcasts relating to the Faculty of English Language and Literature.Fiona Stafford explores the various relationships between human lifestyles and trees, from mytholody to medicine.

As an internationally renowned centre of teaching and research in all aspects of music, it is an exciting and stimulating environment in which to work and study.Our undergraduate and graduate curricula are strong in traditional musicological and musical skills – for musicologists, performers and composers – but are also notably wide-ranging and imaginative. They reflect the spectrum of contemporary developments in music and musicology: from the 13th-century motet to global hip-hop; from ethnomusicology to music psychology; from historically informed performance practice to electroacoustic composition. Alongside our formal programmes, we organise a wide variety of concerts, masterclasses, workshops, public lectures and conferences. Our resources include the celebrated Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a high-spec electronic music studio, a prize-winning library, an Indonesian gamelan and specialised resources for the study of performance. Students work closely with our resident ensembles, which include the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment, the Cavaleri String Quartet and Contrapunctus. And all this is complemented by the exceptionally rich musical and academic life of the wider University and its colleges, with world-famous choirs, University orchestras and chamber groups, jazz and contemporary music ensembles, as well as the unrivalled resources of the Bodleian Library.Our research, too, covers a broad spectrum, including European music from 800 to the present day, ethnomusicology, composition, opera studies, film and popular musics, music theory and analysis, the psychology of music and performance studies. The Faculty is home to the European Research Council’s €1.7m research centre, Music, Digitization, Mediation: Towards Interdisciplinary Music Studies. And our own work is greatly enriched by a roster of regular visitors from the worlds of musicology, performance and composition, and from the wider professional musical world.In this series TORCH Knowledge Exchange Fellow, Professor Laura Tunbridge from the Faculty of Music, introduces music by German Romantic composer Robert Schumann, focusing particularly on the late works being featured in the Oxford Lieder Festival (14-29 October, 2016). Prof. Tunbridge discusses the challenges of performing and interpreting this music with Professor Barry Murnane and Richard Wigmore, and performers Sarah Connolly, James Gilchrist, Tim Horton, Eugene Asti, and Roger Vignoles.More podcasts from the Faculty of MusicThe idea of a global history of music, which may be traced back to enlightenment forerunners, and has been reiterated in the 1970s by the music historian Leo Treitler, among others. The present situation in various branches of western musicology is characterised by specialisation – on European music history on the one hand, on ethnological or sociological fieldwork on the other. Research on specific musical cultures sometimes lacks comparative outreach or is insufficiently reflected in the wider discipline. The historical depth of other civilisations is often underrated by western scholarship, and a concern for the world’s musical past, shared with non-western speakers, is rarely visible.Postcolonial critique has challenged the West’s self-ascribed position at the heart of world history. In the light of this challenge, how might a historical understanding of western music in the world proceed? How should it position, or justify itself? Who might be authorised to speak for, or against, it? What would ‘western music’ look like in an account of music history that aspired to be truly global?More research projects and centres from the Faculty of MusicFor more information, visit the Music Faculty websiteEventshttp://www.music.ox.ac.uk/events/ Undergraduate coursesUniversity websiteGraduate coursesUniversity websiteResearchLink to faculty websiteAcademic staffLink to faculty websiteOxford UniversityOxford's ResearchFees and fundingLibrariesMuseums and CollectionsOpen daysOxford GlossaryProspective undergraduatesProspective graduate studentsCurrent Oxford studentsCurrent Oxford staffVisitors/TouristsMediaAlumniTeachersBusinesses/PartnershipsContact searchJobs and VacanciesTerm datesMapGiving to OxfordAmong subjects in the Humanities, Oriental Studies is unique in introducing students to cultures and civilisations that do not usually form part of the mainstream curriculum in British schools. The courses present both the major traditions of the regions studied and, in most cases, their modern developments. All courses include language, literature, history and culture,and there are a wide range of options in such fields as art and archaeology, history, literature, philosophy, religion and modern social studies.The following are the principal areas of study: Islamic World, Hebrew and Jewish Studies, Eastern Christianity, Egyptology and Ancient Near East, South and Inner Asia and East Asian Studies.In addition to the above subject areas, a major benefaction from the Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai has fully endowed a new Chair of Buddhist Studies at Oxford.Oriental Studies has a long history in Oxford. The Bodleian and other libraries have acquired magnificent collections. The Oriental Institute, Bodleian Japanese, Indian Institute, Bodleian K B Chen China Centre Libraries, and the Leopold Muller Memorial Library for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, offer loan collections in their respective fields. Adjacent to the Oriental Institute is the Ashmolean Museum, which houses superb collections. The Sackler Library includes the principal library for Egyptology and Ancient Near Eastern Studies.Most courses offer the opportunity to spend time in the region being studied. The Arabic courseincludes a year in the Middle East, the Persian and Turkish courses a year in Iran or Turkey respectively, the Hebrew course an optional year in Israel. Both the Chinese and Japanese coursesinclude a year abroad for all undergraduates in their second year, where they attend a course at a university which has been especially designed for Oxford’s undergraduates.Lectures and workshops on the study and research of Ancient Egypt and Egyptology.More podcasts from the Faculty of Oriental StudiesRecent research in the history of early modern South Asia has emphasized its remarkable commercial, political and cultural successes. By the middle of the seventeenth century the region had emerged as the world’s premiere exporter of craft manufactures. Externally, the Mughal imperial state had established itself as a major player in the exchanges between Asia’s emerging ‘universal’ empires, and within the region had devised a framework of rule effective in its ability to incorporate regional power-holders in return for support for their own local authority. The region was also home to an extraordinarily fertile linguistic and literary landscape, in which regional vernaculars flourished and in a complex interplay with the cosmopolitan languages of Persian and Sanskrit. Underpinning these changes and linking together the worlds of court and household, temple and lodge, market, manufactory and military camp, were developing networks of specialists - service and scribal people - who constituted a vital resource as much in the households of local elites as at the courts of imperial and regional states.More research projects and centres from the Faculty of Oriental StudiesFor more information, visit the Oriental Studies websiteUndergraduate coursesUniversity websiteGraduate coursesUniversity websiteResearchLink to faculty websiteAcademic staffLink to faculty website Oxford UniversityOxford's ResearchFees and fundingLibrariesMuseums and CollectionsOpen daysOxford GlossaryProspective undergraduatesProspective graduate studentsCurrent Oxford studentsCurrent Oxford staffVisitors/TouristsMediaAlumniTeachersBusinesses/PartnershipsContact searchJobs and VacanciesTerm datesMapGiving to OxfordOxford is one of the world's great centres for philosophy.

Alexander Neckam, from St Albans, is recorded as giving biblical and moral lectures as early as 1193, on the Psalms of David and the Wisdom of Solomon. One of the first major University buildings (still intact and recently described as ‘the loveliest room in England') was the Divinity School, which was begun in 1423 to cater for Theology lectures. So we have a long history behind us, of which Oxford's beautiful setting and many historic buildings remind us.Nevertheless, we are very much aware that present and future success cannot rest on past achievements. Recent developments include our work in the Study of Religion and in the major religious traditions of the world, and also our exploration of the interface between science and religion.At the heart of the Faculty of Theology and Religion are those who hold full-time permanent positions and who have a particular responsibility for teaching, research and the delivery of the syllabus, as well as academic leadership. These University postholders number 23 in all; they are Professors and University Lecturers. Each is attached to a College: some have greater responsibilities to undergraduates, and others to graduates. But the Faculty is further enriched by its 100 or so other members; they include research fellows and College chaplains, lecturers and tutors, and they are involved in teaching, largely through tutorials.For more information about what life is like at the Faculty, visit the Theology and Religion blog.Sacrifice is at the heart of religion. It is not surprising, then, that the 'turn to religion' we have witnessed over the past two decades has led to a renewed interest in sacrifice as well. In light of this, the Centre for Theology and Modern European Thought at the University of Oxford presents five interviews with contributors to the recently-published book Sacrifice and Modern Thought (ed. Zachhuber and Meszaros, 2013). At around 15 minutes in length, each interview provides an insight into how the modern fascination for the topic of sacrifice has evolved, and how the concept of sacrifice in turn has shaped theological debate, the literary imagination and anthropological theory. We hope you enjoy the recordings.More podcasts from the Theology and Religion FacultyThe Arts and Humanities Research Council has made a grant of £199,258 to Professor Joshua Hordern, Associate Professor of Christian Ethics, for this 18 month project (January 2017-June 2018).
