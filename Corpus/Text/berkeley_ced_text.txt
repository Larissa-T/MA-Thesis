The Ph.D. in architecture is a research degree appropriate for those seeking careers in teaching and scholarship in architecture and its related areas, or in roles in government or professional consultation that require depth in specialization and experience in research. Berkeley’s Ph.D. program in architecture is interdisciplinary in outlook, reaching into the various disciplines related to architecture and incorporating substantial knowledge from outside fields. Students admitted to this program carry out a program of advanced study and research, both on the basis of formal class work and of individual investigation. Work centers on three related fields of study, the major field (the basis for the dissertation), and one-to-two minor fields, at least one of which must be from a discipline outside architecture.The Ph.D. degree emphasizes course work and supervised independent research in one of the following areas of study:Major fields outside these fields or combinations thereof may also be proposed at the time of admission.Course work is individually developed through consultation with an academic adviser. Outside fields of study may take advantage of the University’s varied resources. Recent graduates have completed outside fields in anthropology, art history, business administration, city and regional planning, computer science, various engineering fields, psychology, women’s studies, geography and sociology.The following are members of the Ph.D faculty who oversee Ph.D. students in the Architecture Department. Please also review the current list of all faculty in the Architecture Department for other faculty and specialities.

	The Department of City and Regional Planning (DCRP) and Department of Architecture offer a concurrent degree program for exceptionally well-qualified students who hold the five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree or a four-year bachelor of arts/bachelor of science degree in architecture, as well as those who have completed equivalent degrees in related disciplines. This program allows completion of the Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) and the Master of City Planning (M.C.P.) degrees with a savings of 12 units (one semester’s course work).
	The concurrent program in city planning and architecture aims to combine the study of urban and planning issues with the design of buildings and sites. By providing a range of essential skills as well as a broad understanding of the social, economic, and natural factors that shape the physical environment, the concurrent degree program in architecture and city planning accomplishes what neither program achieves alone.
	The concurrent program in city planning and architecture integrates understanding of urban and planning issues with building and sites. As the disciplines of city planning and architecture have evolved in the past few decades, their education and practice have become more specialized. Architecture usually focused on the design of buildings and complexes, while city and regional planning has typically focused on overall management and policy of environments in both urban and regional settings. In the current world of practice, there is a great need for professionals who are able to combine an understanding of complex architectural design with larger-scale urban and regional issues that represent the social, economic and natural factors that influence and shape the physical environment. By providing an all-encompassing understanding and a range of essential skills for effectively impacting and enhancing the built environment, the concurrent degree program in city planning and architecture accomplishes both of these dual and often not-so-converging roles.
	The M.Arch. portion of the concurrent program requires completion of 24 to 72 semester units, depending upon the student’s undergraduate degree; the M.C.P. segment calls for 36 semester units. No special curriculum applies to this concurrent program; rather, the requirements of both programs must be satisfied by students enrolled in the concurrent program. Both departments expect that students will coordinate with their advisors the individual study plans for the concurrent degree relative to their interests. In the M.C.P. curriculum, students must declare an area of concentration and complete a core of courses selected to complement their backgrounds and interests. In the M.Arch. curriculum, students must complete a set of core of courses in several areas including history, theory, structures, etc., and declare the thesis intention. The areas of emphases for students in the concurrent program include housing, urban design, project development, and community design, among others.
	Students in the concurrent program may chose between three options to fulfill their final requirements for the concurrent degree: (1) produce one combined research thesis in an area of emphasis with four faculty members including two from DCRP and two from ARCH; (2) produce an independent study design or research thesis in ARCH and a parallel professional report in DCRP; or (3) complete a design thesis in a thesis studio in ARCH and a professional or client report in DCRP.
	The program is chaired by Nezar AlSayyad, Professor of Architecture, City and Regional Planning, and Urban Design, who also serves as graduate adviser for the program. Faculty who serve on concurrent program projects include:
	Graduates of the concurrent M.C.P./M.Arch. degree program work in a variety of companies and organizations. Our alumni hold positions in several organizations including architectural firms, planning consultancies, public policy institutes, development companies, city governments, nonprofit and non-governmental corporations and research institutions.

	The Department of Architecture and the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning (LAEP) offer a concurrent program in building and site design that leads to the Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) and Master of Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.) degrees. The program combines knowledge of ecological and social factors with the design of buildings and sites. As the professions of architecture and landscape architecture have matured over the past century, teaching and practice of the disciplines have become increasingly specialized. Architectural education and practice have focused on the design of individual buildings, with little emphasis on site design and environmental issues. Landscape architecture, on the other hand, typically has not been concerned with understanding and creating architectural form, but focuses on the design of outdoor spaces at a variety of scales, from small gardens or parks to large natural landscapes in cities and regions.
	Today, professionals are needed who combine an understanding of individual building design with larger-scale site design and the cultural and natural factors that shape environments at all scales. Neither program alone can provide the range of skills and understanding that the College of Environmental Design considers essential in improving the quality of the built environment.
	The concurrent program requires 72 units of coursework for students who have satisfied all prerequisites, and a minimum of 24 units in each department.
	The concurrent program is intended for exceptionally qualified students who have either an undergraduate degree (B.A. or B.S.) or a professional undergraduate degree (B.Arch. or B.L.A.) in architecture or landscape architecture and who satisfy either the two-year Master of Architecture admission prerequisites or the two-year Master of Landscape Architecture admission prerequisites.
	Application to the concurrent degree program is competitive, and admission is contingent upon the applicant showing that he or she will be able to successfully complete the requirements for both degrees within three years. Applicants must be competitive with the two-year master’s applicants in the second department. Applicants may receive admission into two programs, one program, or neither program. Applicants will be notified of the admission decision separately by each department.
	The following courses or their equivalents are required for admission to the concurrent degree program. Students without this background will be required to take these courses for elective credit.
	* Note: Physics and calculus are prerequisites for this course and must be taken prior to enrollment in the concurrent degree program.

	The Department of City and Regional Planning (DCRP) and the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning (LAEP) jointly offer a program of study with an emphasis in urban design and environmental planning. The program is intended for exceptionally qualified students who have a bachelor’s degree or equivalent in city and regional planning, landscape architecture, architecture, or a related field. Successful completion leads to the degrees of Master of City Planning (M.C.P.) and Master of Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.). Depending on the student’s undergraduate degree, the program can be completed in three or four years.
	The concurrent program combines a common framework of theory and method while permitting specialization in one of two areas: environmental planning or urban design. The common core includes history and theory of the development of urban areas; basic characteristics of land, water, and climate and how they relate to development and conservation; social and environmental spatial concepts; environmental measurement, including physical, social, and psychological measures; economic values associated with land conservation and development; and infrastructure. In addition to the common core, students must also complete an option core, an area of specialization, and a thesis or professional project.
	The environmental planning option emphasizes training in the planning process, development economics, political institutions and law, and regulatory policy and administration. It aims to educate students to apply this training to decisions about the appropriate use of land and natural resources. Environmental planning candidates should have a basic knowledge of ecological principles relevant to planning and design, as well as competence in graphic communication skills. An undergraduate degree in the natural sciences, landscape architecture, or planning is typically required for admission to the concurrent program in environmental planning.
	The urban design option focuses on the design and planning of the physical environment in ways that best respond to people’s needs, values, and aspirations. Course work consists of design, theory, history, survey and measurement, and implementation. Urban design candidates should have competence in basic design, landscape materials, and graphic communication skills. Typically an undergraduate degree in environmental design, architecture, or landscape architecture is required for admission to the concurrent program in urban design.

Topics include contour, scale, perspective, color, tone, texture, and design.  Coming soon  Special Topics in Digital Design Theories and MethodsThis seminar focuses on video media and filmic mode of representation, Emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century as an unprecedented means of capturing time, cinema, at its best, attempts to delineate “time” -- makes visible or comprehensible “temporal dimension.”  According to Bergson, “time, identified as duration in the impetus given to consciousness by sensation, links the past, present, and future in a seamless continuum”1. WIthin cinematic space, this temporal scale is manifested as “material duration” where its formal and narrative structure together with light form the “architecture (as re-presentation and manifestation) of time.”From the perspective of a maker (a producer of space), this seminar will explore film and video media as modes of re-examinations and fabrication of temporal scale in architecture. Through both comparative and directed study, we will  attempt  to  utilize  film/video  media  and  their  inherent  methods  together  with  architectural  conventions;  i.e. diagrams and orthographic projections, as measuring / computation devises to calibrate form and space in building design.Within the context of this study, we will acknowledge the critical differences in the tectonic nature of architecture and film media. Through a series of film as case studies each week, we will critically investigate specific theoretical, structural, and technological constraints inherent to each medium. Another underlying objective of the seminar is to investigate the relationship of space and time as both cultural and phenomenological construct. Particularly, the proliferation and advancement of information technology, the effects of globalization and cross-breeding of ideas, as they rapidly and perpetually re-defined our shifting perception of space and time.Arch 130 provides an introduction to the ideas that have informed design thinking from the 19th century to the present, with an emphasis on the debates of the last four decades. The course explores significant changes in theory and practice across the design disciplines and professions (with particular emphasis on architecture), and considers how they are connected to larger social and historical forces. Students will be introduced to important tendencies in both critical reflection and design, and explore their interconnection through case studies of building, urban spaces and cities.Readings and lectures situate debates about design theory at UC Berkeley in a broader national and international framework and explore the how past approaches continue to shape those that are influential today. Key issues extend from the role of industrialization in 19th century design thinking, through the rise of modernism and postmodernism, to recent issues surrounding digital technology, sustainability and globalization. Special Topics in Architectural Theory"Design & Diffrence: Spaces of Queer Theory"
This seminar examines the relationship between space, power and identity through recent arguments around queer theory and the politics of cultural difference. Over the last two decades queer theory has undergone a series of shifts and transformations, as challenges to heteronormativity and the institutional production of gendered and sexed identities have been enriched by intersecting considerations of class, race, religion, nationhood, ecology and economy, amongst others. This seminar will provide a cross-disciplinary introduction to these debates, while also considering the urban and architectural contexts in which identities are produced, lived and transformed. Readings and discussions are organized  around a sequence of thematic sections, each two weeks in length. In the first week of each theme, we will consider specific embodiments of queer theory; in the second, we will explore the mediating role of space in the formation of identities, through case studies at scales extending from the domestic interior to the transnational territory: Part I: thresholds: Spaces of queer theory  Part II: transsections: Transgender histories and architectures Part III: dis/embodiments: Queering disability: Rethinking “standards” and universal design Part IV: visibilities: Queer visibilities: Pinkwashing, gentrification, and activism Part V: un/natures Queer ecologies: Unnatural subjects and the urban/rural divide. Part VI: queer necropolitics: The carceral city and LGBTQ abolition movements Conclusion: futurities: Activism and queer spaces of political imaginationThe course is open to graduate students (Arch 239) and upper division undergraduates (Arch 139). Students of all academic disciplines, orientations and identities are welcome to take part. Course requirements include weekly reading responses, a class presentation and a creative/research project.Presentations by leaders in the Bay Area professional community on a variety of topics related to green buildings, offering perspectives from the fields of architecture, engineering, consulting, urbanism, and research.  We have a stellar line-up of dynamic speakers who have been keynote speakers at a variety of venues - it’s as if we’re bringing the conference to you!  So why not end the week with a bit of decompression, enjoy some insights some of the leading professionals in our industry.  The class can be taken for variable units.  For 1 unit, there is required weekly attendance, reading, and one end-of-semester written assignment (details will be on the bSpace site).  For 2 units, there will be additional writing assignments. A bSpace site will be available as the semester approaches - look there for the Schedule of Speakers (under Syllabus), and for more information about the writing assignments for 2 units (under Assignments). This is a five week "module" course. It will meet the first five weeks of the semester only. "Healthy Buildings"This is a five week module class And will run from 29 Sept to 27 Oct 2017The UN Declaration on Human Rights states, “healthyenvironments are a human right”. But what are healthy environments, and how do we design healthy environments for all and know that they are working as intended? This course will look at the elements of healthy environments, including physical characteristics such as indoor air quality, lighting, materials, as well as psychological and sociological characteristics of comfort, privacy, and control. Lectures and case studies will look at a range of building types, such as student apartments, housing for the elderly, schools, workplaces, and communities. Students will have readings, short in-class assignments, homework, and one project. This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of the history of the built environment from its beginnings to about 1500CE. The scope is broad in geographical, cultural, and architectural terms, combining architectural and urban history with anthropology, and geography. It is also an introduction to historical methods in architectural history. Students will learn a variety of ways to look at the history of buildings and cities while they learn both canonical monuments and less celebrated examples. Although the prime emphasis is on the Mediterranean basin, a substantial number of lectures will be devoted to architecture in Asia, Africa, and Meso-America. Students interested in history, art history, anthropology, archaeology, architecture, sociology, planning, material culture, cities, and urbanism will find it an excellent introduction to the subject, as well as to the humanities in general. Students from all departments and at all levels are welcome! Satisfies the general breadth requirement for Historical Studies and Arts and Literature.. "Writing on the Walls"We all pass by ugly buildings everyday, often in silent, unconscious protest, or register beautiful ones fleetingly, alas, through a windshield. This turning away leaves us unprepared to judge, and more importantly, to demand better. Yet architecture is the most public of arts. We all use it everyday and this makes us all arbiters of it. This ART OF WRITING course aims to empower students to seek out their own critical voices in writing about their surroundings. It will help students sharpen their eye and to show them how to lay out plainly, but with sophistication, the ramifications of various kinds of interventions in the built environment. The campus will be the course's quarry. Students will tour Berkeley's buildings and landscape and read them against both architectural criticism and essays by authors such as John McPhee, John Updike, Christopher Hitchens, Sue Allison, Wendell Berry, and Patricia Hampl.  his seminar is aimed at introducing two different ways of dealing with space. The first mode —utopian thought— has been around for long time and, at least since the “socialist utopians” of the industrial revolution, has been a key influence on urban design and planning. The first part of this course will focus on these attempts and on the influence that they still have on present days urban planning and design. Beginning with a discussion on the concept of utopia, the class will then look at the influence of utopian thought in several contemporary urban and planning case studies.
The second mode of thinking is suggested by the recent emergence of the concept of heterotopia. While utopias deal largely with physical space, this concept points at the existence of "other spaces" that coexist and overlap with the physical environment and create a multiple layering of spatial meanings, conflicts, and uses. Taking heterotopia as its starting point, in the second part of the seminar we'll discuss the characteristics of these social spaces and look for examples of it. Many California architects came from other places: Maybeck from New York via the  Ecole Des Beaux Arts; Schindler and Neutra from Vienna; Frank Gehry from Chicago. But, once they arrived, their encounters with the Golden State produced new and original forms of architecture. This seminar will examine the qualities of the state’s environment, culture, economy, and population that have produced unique buildings and landscapes during the 20th century. We will look at both Northern and Southern California, starting with canonical designers then moving beyond them to consider lesser-known regional architects whose work embodies local characteristics. We will base our investigations on existing research but even more on direct experience of buildings and an understanding of their capacity to respond to regional considerations such as history, climate, landscape and culture. The course is organized around lectures, discussion of the readings and student presentations  Description: Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate. (F,SP)  "Bio-inspired Design & Fabrication"Building on the positive experience of the previous year, Studio One 2017-18 will once again focus on the topic of Bio-inspired Design and Fabrication and thereby venture out into the unchartered territories between architecture, engineering, and biology. The main goal of the studio is to gain knowledge from the analysis of living systems to find solutions to problems, create new inventions and innovations, and transfer this knowledge to building and architectural systems. Even though nature cannot be directly copied, the living world can provide architects and engineers with a wealth of analogues and inspirations for their own creative designs. The basic motivation behind the transfer of biological solutions to technical applications is the assumption that optimized biological structures have been developed in the course of 3,8 billion years of evolution that could also be significant and convincing in technical developments. Nature has numerous of “ingenious solutions” available that can often be understood intuitively. However, it is seldom easy to explain the underlying mechanism, and in particular to explain how these principles can be applied to technology. It is this discrepancy that makes the field of bio-inspired design and fabrication so relevant for the future. In order to shed light on this question, the studio seeks to forge new interdisciplinary alliances and cross-professional partnerships. Based on this framework, the studio will bridge the areas of biomimetics, computational design, structural analysis, material-based fabrication and construction. In studio, the students will follow an inquiry-oriented, experiment-based, and project-driven research agenda. Based on an intensive, critical, and analytical approach to cutting-edge design and construction methods, the studio aims to go one step further by taking inspiration from the flexible and resilient structures found in plants and insects. By closely investigating biological structures for their efficiency and adaptability as well as abstracting their underlying construction principles into suitable architectural systems, the studio will challenge our present understanding with new bio-inspired fabrication and construction concepts.While in the first semester of the program, the students will mainly work individually and in small groups, the aim of the second semester is to join forces and push one idea into a bigger scale together. Over the course of the program, students will design and fabricate small-scale models, mid-sized prototypes, and large-scale demonstrators that showcase the potential of bio-inspired concepts and anticipate a new foundation for a lightweight, multifunctional, and sustainable architecture.  This course is a Primer interrogating the myriad development forces which produce our streets,neighborhoods, towns, cities and regions, as well as our global slums and blighted urban landscapes. Aspiring to empower design and planning professionals with greater agency to participate in the creation of urban places, the class will develop a critical understanding of development practices and their impact on social, economic and urban form. Sought through a broad understanding of fundamental real estate development processes and enterprises, students will be challenged to explore how the benefits of their design and planning expertise might be extended to more people, mitigate systemic urban problems, and to more effectively impact what type of urban environments we make. Seminar topics will attempt to demystify real estate development explored through a review of selected Case Studies and weekly lectures by the Instructor and invited design, planning and development industry professionals. This course will investigate how Development, Architecture and Urbanism are intertwined, contending that cities are our most sustainable resource, holding the key to our social, economic, and culturally equitable future, as well as our planet’s environmental stewardship.This course will promote an interdisciplinary approach for design professionals and policy makers who collaborate together in the development of cities, designed to include Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Urban Design, City &amp; Regional Planning, and Law and Business graduate students. Extended Description
"Narrative & Form: Cinema & Architecture"The seminar will include a group of sessions in which the students will be exposed to different films that are in particular interest to the relationship between narrative and space. We will ask the reverse question: how can one describe space, architecture via the vehicle of cinematic image (how was Antonoini’s cinema a promoter of modernity in Italy di-associating himself from the romantic/nostalgic of the Italian landscape.We will be presenting the four chapters of John Berger’s Ways of Seeing in which he is looking at forms of pictorial representations. We will challenge the students to choose a venue in Berkeley/Oakland and conclude the seminar by creating a short film that will represent some of the paradigms elaborated in the seminar.Different films from Gitai’s work, Kadosh, Kippur, Lullaby to my father based on his Bauhaus- trained father and from his series on architecture will also be presented.Amos Gitai is an acclaimed Israeli filmmaker, widely known for making documentaries and feature films, surrounding the Middle East and Jewish-Arab conflict.Gitai's work was presented in several major retrospective in Pompidou Center Paris, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) New-York, the Lincoln Center New-York and the British Film Institute London. To date Gitai has created over 90 works of art over 38 years. Between 1999 and 2011 seven of his films were entered in the Cannes Film Festival for the Palme d'Or as well as the Venice Film Festival for the Golden Lion award. He received several prestigious prizes, in particular the Leopard of Honor at the Locarno International Film Festival (2008), the Roberto Rossellini prize (2005), the Robert Bresson prize (2013) and the Paradjanov prize (2014). His recent feature film, Rabin, The Last Day, was presented at the 72th Venice Film Festival. Extended Description"Playground Design & the Giant Eye"This seminar establishes the groundwork for a design-build studio in spring 2018 on playground design involving an interactive learning structure.  The Giant Eye is a model of the human visual pathway all the way to the brain that children (and adults) can move through in order to experience anatomy three-dimenionally. As a small building, it is also a sculpture, a contribution to the playground landscape, and at any scale it is a playful, engaging learning experience.  In the fall 2017 we will visit the site, make some basic decisions regarding scale and materials, review literature on playground theory, and directly experience EyeBody theory as developed by Peter Grunwald, EyeBody.  Students who take this seminar do not have to take the studio in the spring, and those who are unable to take the seminar are still eligible to take the studio in the spring, but this seminar will help the studio students be able to produce construction drawings by spring break, so that contraction can proceed on schedule.  Learning outcomes: foundations of playground theory, practical experience in site analysis, practical experience in interviewing clients, how the human visual system works. Virtual Reality is progressively emerging as a particularly adequate medium not only to visualize architecture, but to design it too. The capacities that VR offers to experience space virtually may be the closest approximation to actual physical experience currently available to designers. But can this newly found capacity impact the process of design itself? This graduate seminar will engage in an open reflection and active experimentation on several dimensions of VR that may affect how we conceive and experience environments at design stage. Some of the topics to be explored include daylighting simulation and representation in virtual reality; linking parametric design and VR; modeling, representation and analysis of significant examples in recent architecture history; and 360 VR filming of relevant buildings. The seminar will use the equipment and resources included in the newly created VR Lab at Wurster Hall, and will explore potential connections both with the Center for Augmented Cognition and the VR Club at Berkeley.  We will build as much urban fabric in the next forty years as we have in all the previous 10,000 years of human history.  At this same time, we collect more detailed, specific information every seventy-two hours than we did in all of human history until 2007. This information is digital, increasingly spatialized, and substantially urban in its character. Yet data is not knowledge. This radical quantitative increase in the amount of urban fabric is inseparable from a radical qualitative increase in the nature of human uncertainty. This is due to the inherent unpredictability around the effects that unprecedented anthropogenic change in our climate and global ecology will have on our natural and built environments. As part of ced’s participation in the San Francisco Bay Area Resilient by Design Challenge (www.resilientbayarea.org,) students in this seminar will learn and deploy a range of techniques in site analysis and representation. This effort will be supported by collaboration with other partners in the CED’s team, including Aecom, CCA, CMG Landscape Architects, Silvestrum, Skeo and IDEO. Preparing the Bay Area for the effects of climate change will involve preparing for, and managing, the certain uncertainties of climate change and sea level rise. And any problem in uncertainty is always already a problem of representation.  For architect and planners, who draw what would otherwise be unseen or unforeseen—that is, both existing conditions and proposed constructions—this is especially true. The construction and consideration of this new urban fabric will have to be imagined and represented in powerfully adaptive ways. Such techniques will draw on the best traditions of urban representation even as they also inaugurate speculative, innovative, and instrumental proposals for imagining cities in time and space—all subject to the radical contingency of uncertain circumstances.TTherefore, thus course is dedicated to research at the intersection of data, the city, and drawing. As such, it involves a combination of practices — research, reading, representation and technique – often encountered separately, yet whose combination and synthesis is essential to understanding the limits and possibilities of contemporary urban representation.The course is divided into three four-week modules, each of which deals with specific technologies, techniques, and conceptual approaches around drawing the city; mapping, drawing, and their graphic synthesis. Each module will contain a combination of critical and historical reading, precedent studies, software workshops, and the production/revision of drawings. The course is open to students with all levels of experience and from all backgrounds by interview with the instructor.  This seminar focuses on video media and filmic mode of representation, Emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century as an unprecedented means of capturing time, cinema, at its best, attempts to delineate “time” -- makes visible or comprehensible “temporal dimension.”  According to Bergson, “time, identified as duration in the impetus given to consciousness by sensation, links the past, present, and future in a seamless continuum”1.

This class also focuses on practical and effective applications of a wide range of data mining and machine learning techniques to a variety of real-world problems in the field of the design and operation of buildings. "Flexible Hybrid Structures "This class lies at the intersection of design, architecture, engineering, and computer science and aims to attract students from across the campus. In this interdisciplinary framework, students will explore the design possibilities that emerge from combining soft, flexible, and elastic materials with bespoke 3D-printed joinery.The topics in this class will include a general introduction to bending-active structures and a special focus on hybrid systems that either combine different materials or take advantage of highly differentiated material characteristics. In small teams, students will investigate inspirational case studies of bending and folding principles in nature and technology and present the underlying mechanisms and possible range of applications to their colleagues in the class. Based on this knowledge, students will conduct physical experiments, which explore the idea of using large elastic deformations of initially straight or planar rods and plates in order to generate and stabilize geometrically complex shapes. In parallel to these physical experiments, students will also learn how to recreate their designs by using digital form-finding simulations. By synchronizing their hands-on tests with digital simulations, the students will be able to follow an iterative design process and explore the larger design space of flexible structures and mechanisms. . This seminar will reevaluate of the material nature of buildings by studying and understanding construction details and the new technologies that are revolutionizing design construction and labor relations in architecture. Nowhere in architecture is bodily contact felt more readily than in realm of detail. Small when compared to a building’s overall mass, details should be considered the building’s basic genetic in-print determining not just the architecture’s
appearance but also its performance. Each detail contributes to the meaning of the whole and simultaneously represents a microcosm of the larger entity. For Le Corbusier this idea could be traced back to nature where the smallest cell determines the validity of the whole.
Through dedicated lectures by local practitioners, research, analysis, and interpretation of case studies and self generated design investigations we
will explore and understand formal and material innovation and the increasingly global nature of architectural practice; consultants, suppliers, and fabricators as well as the understanding of the critical role of computers in architecture. Finally we will also discuss the ethical dimension of detailing as the choice of materials and their combination has a potential impact on world resources, environments, and economy.Structure
The course is structured in three parts:
1) Discussions of essays by scholars and practitioners an detailing, practice and materials
2) A series of lectures by Bay Area practitioners focused on detailing work in their practices
3)An  in depth case-study  of significant buildings focusing on design ethos of the architect practice , construction
technique, materials leading to the design and the making of  one 1: 1 detail intended to develop and advance your mown design work.TASKS.
1)Weekly reading response Attendance and Participation in Discussions
You are required to prepare a brief response of three critical questions to all of the assigned readings of no more
than 150 words, which you may be asked to read aloud at the start of the class discussions each week. Your
response should not be a summary; rather it should present critical issues/questions the reading has raised for you.
You may also use it to suggest connections/conflicts with previous readings, or perhaps establish a link with work
you are doing in other courses. A copy of your response must be submitted at the beginning of each class. These
will form an integral part of the final grade you receive for class participation. Attendance is mandatory. Regular,
enthusiastic and informed participation in class discussions is an important part of your contribution to the class.2)CASE Studies Leading to the construction of one detail:
Choose buildings case studies that are of interest to you and that will lead to the 1:1 design a detail it may be a different scale depending on the chosen detail).
    
.Focus on the different assemblies/materials
a) Give us a general context, site and climatic context
b) General architectural context of the architect work. Illustrate the building identify the detail’s location/s
c) Present the details in 11X14” sheets of paper (as many as necessary )presented horizontally. Include a graphic
scale.
d) Choose the case studies with some thesis or subject in mind; for example the staging of parts, de-mountability, ergonomics,
accessibility, economy, durability or serial applicability. This seminar looks at the implications of off-site fabrication in architecture: consistent, protected environments; worker efficiency and safety; coordination of trades; cheaper, semi-skilled labor; construction periods shortened; and completion dates more predictable. Off-site fabrication can allow for increased refinement and trial assemblies. However, it may also create monotonous sameness when the processes and results are not considered with care. Prerequisites: 160/ 260 Introduction to Construction or consent of instructor. This seminar looks at the implications of off-site fabrication in architecture: consistent, protected environments; worker efficiency and safety; coordination of trades; cheaper, semi-skilled labor; construction periods shortened; and completion dates more predictable. Off-site fabrication can allow for increased refinement and trial assemblies. However, it may also create monotonous sameness when the processes and results are not considered with care.This seminar will take a closer look at the implications of off-site fabrication in architectural production. It will move through three steps: in the initial weeks, we will look at precedents for off-site fabrication in architecture and construction, establishing an intellectual framework for subsequent work. Following this, we will look more closely at some common opportunities for off-site fabrication today. Finally, students will present their own research on local fabrication opportunities. This research will include a detailed report on fabrication opportunities, based on your interviews with architects and fabricators.During the course of the semester, readings and visits to fabricators should allow sufficient opportunity for everyone to develop a clear sense of the way off-site fabrication fits into architectural production. I hope we will also begin to develop a sense of what is unique about San Francisco's fabrication community. I have begun to understand local opportunities during the past few years, but I still have much to learn and am looking forward to you teaching me.Students are not expected to have practice or construction experience for this class, although those who do will have an advantage. By the end of the semester, you should expect to have developed an understanding of the various ways that off-site fabrication fits within design and construction systems, from approaches that cheapen design to those that result in refined architectural output."Case Studies in Modern Architecture"This survey of the “built discourses” of modern architecture reviews attempts to define modernity as a mode of design practice and a way of life. Through case studies of individual buildings, lectures examine developments in style, theory, graphic representation, construction technology and interior programming. "Architecture and Innovation" This course is required  for all students enrolled in the Studio One program. Some seats may be available for interested graduate students. Please contact the instructor for more information.When we look at housing developments where identical single-family homes are repeated for miles, it is difficult to think of innovation as a key factor in architectural production. On the other hand, if we think of the work of most architects, innovation – driven by a mix of the architect’s ideas, use of new materials, technological advances, new production processes, and changes in their socio-economic context– is always sought after. Often, though, architectural innovation remains only as an idea on paper, or as one-of-the-kind product, even when intended to respond to a broader market.
The latter case is the topic of this seminar. The seminar is organized around case studies (selected and developed with the students) of architectural innovations that ‘failed’. The case studies should not be utopian proposals with no chance of being produced. Rather, they should be ideas, proposals, and actual buildings that while based on seemingly good ideas aimed to a broad market, remained “one-off”. his seminar is aimed at introducing two different ways of dealing with space. The first mode —utopian thought— has been around for long time and, at least since the “socialist utopians” of the industrial revolution, has been a key influence on urban design and planning. The first part of this course will focus on these attempts and on the influence that they still have on present days urban planning and design. Beginning with a discussion on the concept of utopia, the class will then look at the influence of utopian thought in several contemporary urban and planning case studies.
The second mode of thinking is suggested by the recent emergence of the concept of heterotopia. While utopias deal largely with physical space, this concept points at the existence of "other spaces" that coexist and overlap with the physical environment and create a multiple layering of spatial meanings, conflicts, and uses. Taking heterotopia as its starting point, in the second part of the seminar we'll discuss the characteristics of these social spaces and look for examples of it. Many California architects came from other places: Maybeck from New York via the  Ecole Des Beaux Arts; Schindler and Neutra from Vienna; Frank Gehry from Chicago. But, once they arrived, their encounters with the Golden State produced new and original forms of architecture. This seminar will examine the qualities of the state’s environment, culture, economy, and population that have produced unique buildings and landscapes during the 20th century. We will look at both Northern and Southern California, starting with canonical designers then moving beyond them to consider lesser-known regional architects whose work embodies local characteristics. We will base our investigations on existing research but even more on direct experience of buildings and an understanding of their capacity to respond to regional considerations such as history, climate, landscape and culture. The course is organized around lectures, discussion of the readings and student presentations.During the period from 1950 to 1980, new highway programs, the spread of automobile ownership, economic growth, and more people on the move produced a uniquely American roadside landscape. Roadside strips appeared, lined with monumental signs and billboards, with buildings and parking lots designed to capture automobile traffic.  Cultural commentators from Lewis Mumford to first lady Ladybird Johnson were appalled by these chaotic landscapes, an attitude summed up by Peter Blake’s 1964 diatribe, God’s Own Junkyard. Well-known geographers analyzed “Visual Blight in America.” With a few exceptions such as the work of J.B. Jackson, such negative readings dominated until the 1972 appearance of Learning from Las Vegas by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott-Brown and Steven Izenour. They argued for a newly positive and analytical perspective on mobility and the commercial vernacular.  Replaced by limited-access Interstates, these roadside landscapes are now objects for retrospective nostalgia. 
This research seminar will explore the cultural, social, and spatial contexts and significance of these landscapes, focused around a series of documentary photographs of roads and roadside scenes taken by J.B. Jackson, David Lowenthal, Richard Longstreth and Chester Liebs from 1950 to 1970 and recently exhibited in Montpellier, France.  
After several introductory classes surveying the basic literature on the topic, ranging from Jackson, Blake and Venturi, Scott-Brown and Izenour to Vladimir Nabokov, students will select their own related research topic. Possible topics include novelistic and filmic representations, ‘New Topographic’ photography, mobility, tourism, architecture, etc. The information and interpretations students produce will become supplementary material for an exhibition based on the collection of photographs, to open in Spring, 2018. This is the introductory course in methods of inquiry in architecture research to be required of all entering Ph.D. students in all areas of the program. The purpose is to train students in predissertation and prethesis research strategies, expose them to variety of inquiry methods including the value of scholarly research, the nature of evidence, critical reading as content analysis and writing, presenting and illustrating scholarship in the various disciplines of architecture. This course situates case studies in architectural research in relation to major intellectual debates in the Anglo-American academic system since 1945. Weekly readings and discussions onnect specific approaches represented in our course texts to influential paradigms of research epistemology and practice in the humanities and social sciences on the Berkeley campus and beyond. As part of our effort to understand the relationship between architectural research and the wider context of intellectual debates, faculty and students will collaborate on the production of a temporal knowledge map, to be used as a resource in our seminar discussions and in student research projects. Both faculty and students will situate their research interests in relation to the map, connecting our respective scholarly positions to wider fields of debate in the department and on campus.
 
The course is team taught, with all six members of the HTS faculty resident in the Department in the Fall of 2017 taking part. Each faculty member leads a two-week module of the class. The modules are organized thematically, around faculty teaching and research interests, providing students with an introduction to the collective breadth and intellectual differences within our program. The first week of each module creates an intellectual context for the analysis of a major text in the second week. The readings employed to frame each of the major texts will also assist us in constructing bridges to our knowledge map of the Berkeley campus. In the process, students will gain an understanding of the richness and potential of campus debates, their histories and global connections. Weekly assignments (described in further detail below) will mix close readings of texts with attention to wider intellectual, social and historical issues.ARCH 299 [Staff] Below are currently offered courses for the fall 2017 semester. For any other course information, see the UC Berkeley Online Schedule of Classes.Course Format: Two hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week.Prerequisites: Env Des 1 with C- or better.Description: (Formerly Env Des 11A) Introductory studio course: theories of representation and the use of several visual means, including freehand drawing and digital media, to analyze and convey ideas regarding the environment. Topics include contour, scale, perspective, color, tone, texture, and design.  Coming soon  Special Topics in Digital Design Theories and MethodsThis seminar focuses on video media and filmic mode of representation, Emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century as an unprecedented means of capturing time, cinema, at its best, attempts to delineate “time” -- makes visible or comprehensible “temporal dimension.”  According to Bergson, “time, identified as duration in the impetus given to consciousness by sensation, links the past, present, and future in a seamless continuum”1. WIthin cinematic space, this temporal scale is manifested as “material duration” where its formal and narrative structure together with light form the “architecture (as re-presentation and manifestation) of time.”From the perspective of a maker (a producer of space), this seminar will explore film and video media as modes of re-examinations and fabrication of temporal scale in architecture. Through both comparative and directed study, we will  attempt  to  utilize  film/video  media  and  their  inherent  methods  together  with  architectural  conventions;  i.e. diagrams and orthographic projections, as measuring / computation devises to calibrate form and space in building design.Within the context of this study, we will acknowledge the critical differences in the tectonic nature of architecture and film media. Through a series of film as case studies each week, we will critically investigate specific theoretical, structural, and technological constraints inherent to each medium. Another underlying objective of the seminar is to investigate the relationship of space and time as both cultural and phenomenological construct. Particularly, the proliferation and advancement of information technology, the effects of globalization and cross-breeding of ideas, as they rapidly and perpetually re-defined our shifting perception of space and time.Arch 130 provides an introduction to the ideas that have informed design thinking from the 19th century to the present, with an emphasis on the debates of the last four decades. The course explores significant changes in theory and practice across the design disciplines and professions (with particular emphasis on architecture), and considers how they are connected to larger social and historical forces. Students will be introduced to important tendencies in both critical reflection and design, and explore their interconnection through case studies of building, urban spaces and cities.Readings and lectures situate debates about design theory at UC Berkeley in a broader national and international framework and explore the how past approaches continue to shape those that are influential today. Key issues extend from the role of industrialization in 19th century design thinking, through the rise of modernism and postmodernism, to recent issues surrounding digital technology, sustainability and globalization. Special Topics in Architectural Theory"Design & Diffrence: Spaces of Queer Theory"
This seminar examines the relationship between space, power and identity through recent arguments around queer theory and the politics of cultural difference. Over the last two decades queer theory has undergone a series of shifts and transformations, as challenges to heteronormativity and the institutional production of gendered and sexed identities have been enriched by intersecting considerations of class, race, religion, nationhood, ecology and economy, amongst others. This seminar will provide a cross-disciplinary introduction to these debates, while also considering the urban and architectural contexts in which identities are produced, lived and transformed. Readings and discussions are organized  around a sequence of thematic sections, each two weeks in length. In the first week of each theme, we will consider specific embodiments of queer theory; in the second, we will explore the mediating role of space in the formation of identities, through case studies at scales extending from the domestic interior to the transnational territory: Part I: thresholds: Spaces of queer theory  Part II: transsections: Transgender histories and architectures Part III: dis/embodiments: Queering disability: Rethinking “standards” and universal design Part IV: visibilities: Queer visibilities: Pinkwashing, gentrification, and activism Part V: un/natures Queer ecologies: Unnatural subjects and the urban/rural divide. Part VI: queer necropolitics: The carceral city and LGBTQ abolition movements Conclusion: futurities: Activism and queer spaces of political imaginationThe course is open to graduate students (Arch 239) and upper division undergraduates (Arch 139). Students of all academic disciplines, orientations and identities are welcome to take part. Course requirements include weekly reading responses, a class presentation and a creative/research project.Presentations by leaders in the Bay Area professional community on a variety of topics related to green buildings, offering perspectives from the fields of architecture, engineering, consulting, urbanism, and research.  We have a stellar line-up of dynamic speakers who have been keynote speakers at a variety of venues - it’s as if we’re bringing the conference to you!  So why not end the week with a bit of decompression, enjoy some insights some of the leading professionals in our industry.  The class can be taken for variable units.  For 1 unit, there is required weekly attendance, reading, and one end-of-semester written assignment (details will be on the bSpace site).  For 2 units, there will be additional writing assignments. A bSpace site will be available as the semester approaches - look there for the Schedule of Speakers (under Syllabus), and for more information about the writing assignments for 2 units (under Assignments). This is a five week "module" course. It will meet the first five weeks of the semester only. "Healthy Buildings"This is a five week module class And will run from 29 Sept to 27 Oct 2017The UN Declaration on Human Rights states, “healthyenvironments are a human right”. But what are healthy environments, and how do we design healthy environments for all and know that they are working as intended? This course will look at the elements of healthy environments, including physical characteristics such as indoor air quality, lighting, materials, as well as psychological and sociological characteristics of comfort, privacy, and control. Lectures and case studies will look at a range of building types, such as student apartments, housing for the elderly, schools, workplaces, and communities. Students will have readings, short in-class assignments, homework, and one project. This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of the history of the built environment from its beginnings to about 1500CE. The scope is broad in geographical, cultural, and architectural terms, combining architectural and urban history with anthropology, and geography. It is also an introduction to historical methods in architectural history. Students will learn a variety of ways to look at the history of buildings and cities while they learn both canonical monuments and less celebrated examples. Although the prime emphasis is on the Mediterranean basin, a substantial number of lectures will be devoted to architecture in Asia, Africa, and Meso-America. Students interested in history, art history, anthropology, archaeology, architecture, sociology, planning, material culture, cities, and urbanism will find it an excellent introduction to the subject, as well as to the humanities in general. Students from all departments and at all levels are welcome! Satisfies the general breadth requirement for Historical Studies and Arts and Literature.. "Writing on the Walls"We all pass by ugly buildings everyday, often in silent, unconscious protest, or register beautiful ones fleetingly, alas, through a windshield. This turning away leaves us unprepared to judge, and more importantly, to demand better. Yet architecture is the most public of arts. We all use it everyday and this makes us all arbiters of it. This ART OF WRITING course aims to empower students to seek out their own critical voices in writing about their surroundings. It will help students sharpen their eye and to show them how to lay out plainly, but with sophistication, the ramifications of various kinds of interventions in the built environment. The campus will be the course's quarry. Students will tour Berkeley's buildings and landscape and read them against both architectural criticism and essays by authors such as John McPhee, John Updike, Christopher Hitchens, Sue Allison, Wendell Berry, and Patricia Hampl.  his seminar is aimed at introducing two different ways of dealing with space. The first mode —utopian thought— has been around for long time and, at least since the “socialist utopians” of the industrial revolution, has been a key influence on urban design and planning. The first part of this course will focus on these attempts and on the influence that they still have on present days urban planning and design. Beginning with a discussion on the concept of utopia, the class will then look at the influence of utopian thought in several contemporary urban and planning case studies.

We will base our investigations on existing research but even more on direct experience of buildings and an understanding of their capacity to respond to regional considerations such as history, climate, landscape and culture. The course is organized around lectures, discussion of the readings and student presentations  Description: Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate. (F,SP)  "Bio-inspired Design & Fabrication"Building on the positive experience of the previous year, Studio One 2017-18 will once again focus on the topic of Bio-inspired Design and Fabrication and thereby venture out into the unchartered territories between architecture, engineering, and biology. The main goal of the studio is to gain knowledge from the analysis of living systems to find solutions to problems, create new inventions and innovations, and transfer this knowledge to building and architectural systems. Even though nature cannot be directly copied, the living world can provide architects and engineers with a wealth of analogues and inspirations for their own creative designs. The basic motivation behind the transfer of biological solutions to technical applications is the assumption that optimized biological structures have been developed in the course of 3,8 billion years of evolution that could also be significant and convincing in technical developments. Nature has numerous of “ingenious solutions” available that can often be understood intuitively. However, it is seldom easy to explain the underlying mechanism, and in particular to explain how these principles can be applied to technology. It is this discrepancy that makes the field of bio-inspired design and fabrication so relevant for the future. In order to shed light on this question, the studio seeks to forge new interdisciplinary alliances and cross-professional partnerships. Based on this framework, the studio will bridge the areas of biomimetics, computational design, structural analysis, material-based fabrication and construction. In studio, the students will follow an inquiry-oriented, experiment-based, and project-driven research agenda. Based on an intensive, critical, and analytical approach to cutting-edge design and construction methods, the studio aims to go one step further by taking inspiration from the flexible and resilient structures found in plants and insects. By closely investigating biological structures for their efficiency and adaptability as well as abstracting their underlying construction principles into suitable architectural systems, the studio will challenge our present understanding with new bio-inspired fabrication and construction concepts.While in the first semester of the program, the students will mainly work individually and in small groups, the aim of the second semester is to join forces and push one idea into a bigger scale together. Over the course of the program, students will design and fabricate small-scale models, mid-sized prototypes, and large-scale demonstrators that showcase the potential of bio-inspired concepts and anticipate a new foundation for a lightweight, multifunctional, and sustainable architecture.  This course is a Primer interrogating the myriad development forces which produce our streets,neighborhoods, towns, cities and regions, as well as our global slums and blighted urban landscapes. Aspiring to empower design and planning professionals with greater agency to participate in the creation of urban places, the class will develop a critical understanding of development practices and their impact on social, economic and urban form. Sought through a broad understanding of fundamental real estate development processes and enterprises, students will be challenged to explore how the benefits of their design and planning expertise might be extended to more people, mitigate systemic urban problems, and to more effectively impact what type of urban environments we make. Seminar topics will attempt to demystify real estate development explored through a review of selected Case Studies and weekly lectures by the Instructor and invited design, planning and development industry professionals. This course will investigate how Development, Architecture and Urbanism are intertwined, contending that cities are our most sustainable resource, holding the key to our social, economic, and culturally equitable future, as well as our planet’s environmental stewardship.This course will promote an interdisciplinary approach for design professionals and policy makers who collaborate together in the development of cities, designed to include Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Urban Design, City &amp; Regional Planning, and Law and Business graduate students. Extended Description
"Narrative & Form: Cinema & Architecture"The seminar will include a group of sessions in which the students will be exposed to different films that are in particular interest to the relationship between narrative and space. We will ask the reverse question: how can one describe space, architecture via the vehicle of cinematic image (how was Antonoini’s cinema a promoter of modernity in Italy di-associating himself from the romantic/nostalgic of the Italian landscape.We will be presenting the four chapters of John Berger’s Ways of Seeing in which he is looking at forms of pictorial representations. We will challenge the students to choose a venue in Berkeley/Oakland and conclude the seminar by creating a short film that will represent some of the paradigms elaborated in the seminar.Different films from Gitai’s work, Kadosh, Kippur, Lullaby to my father based on his Bauhaus- trained father and from his series on architecture will also be presented.Amos Gitai is an acclaimed Israeli filmmaker, widely known for making documentaries and feature films, surrounding the Middle East and Jewish-Arab conflict.Gitai's work was presented in several major retrospective in Pompidou Center Paris, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) New-York, the Lincoln Center New-York and the British Film Institute London. To date Gitai has created over 90 works of art over 38 years. Between 1999 and 2011 seven of his films were entered in the Cannes Film Festival for the Palme d'Or as well as the Venice Film Festival for the Golden Lion award. He received several prestigious prizes, in particular the Leopard of Honor at the Locarno International Film Festival (2008), the Roberto Rossellini prize (2005), the Robert Bresson prize (2013) and the Paradjanov prize (2014). His recent feature film, Rabin, The Last Day, was presented at the 72th Venice Film Festival. Extended Description"Playground Design & the Giant Eye"This seminar establishes the groundwork for a design-build studio in spring 2018 on playground design involving an interactive learning structure.  The Giant Eye is a model of the human visual pathway all the way to the brain that children (and adults) can move through in order to experience anatomy three-dimenionally. As a small building, it is also a sculpture, a contribution to the playground landscape, and at any scale it is a playful, engaging learning experience.  In the fall 2017 we will visit the site, make some basic decisions regarding scale and materials, review literature on playground theory, and directly experience EyeBody theory as developed by Peter Grunwald, EyeBody.  Students who take this seminar do not have to take the studio in the spring, and those who are unable to take the seminar are still eligible to take the studio in the spring, but this seminar will help the studio students be able to produce construction drawings by spring break, so that contraction can proceed on schedule.  Learning outcomes: foundations of playground theory, practical experience in site analysis, practical experience in interviewing clients, how the human visual system works. Virtual Reality is progressively emerging as a particularly adequate medium not only to visualize architecture, but to design it too. The capacities that VR offers to experience space virtually may be the closest approximation to actual physical experience currently available to designers. But can this newly found capacity impact the process of design itself? This graduate seminar will engage in an open reflection and active experimentation on several dimensions of VR that may affect how we conceive and experience environments at design stage. Some of the topics to be explored include daylighting simulation and representation in virtual reality; linking parametric design and VR; modeling, representation and analysis of significant examples in recent architecture history; and 360 VR filming of relevant buildings. The seminar will use the equipment and resources included in the newly created VR Lab at Wurster Hall, and will explore potential connections both with the Center for Augmented Cognition and the VR Club at Berkeley.  We will build as much urban fabric in the next forty years as we have in all the previous 10,000 years of human history.  At this same time, we collect more detailed, specific information every seventy-two hours than we did in all of human history until 2007. This information is digital, increasingly spatialized, and substantially urban in its character. Yet data is not knowledge. This radical quantitative increase in the amount of urban fabric is inseparable from a radical qualitative increase in the nature of human uncertainty. This is due to the inherent unpredictability around the effects that unprecedented anthropogenic change in our climate and global ecology will have on our natural and built environments. As part of ced’s participation in the San Francisco Bay Area Resilient by Design Challenge (www.resilientbayarea.org,) students in this seminar will learn and deploy a range of techniques in site analysis and representation. This effort will be supported by collaboration with other partners in the CED’s team, including Aecom, CCA, CMG Landscape Architects, Silvestrum, Skeo and IDEO. Preparing the Bay Area for the effects of climate change will involve preparing for, and managing, the certain uncertainties of climate change and sea level rise. And any problem in uncertainty is always already a problem of representation.  For architect and planners, who draw what would otherwise be unseen or unforeseen—that is, both existing conditions and proposed constructions—this is especially true. The construction and consideration of this new urban fabric will have to be imagined and represented in powerfully adaptive ways. Such techniques will draw on the best traditions of urban representation even as they also inaugurate speculative, innovative, and instrumental proposals for imagining cities in time and space—all subject to the radical contingency of uncertain circumstances.TTherefore, thus course is dedicated to research at the intersection of data, the city, and drawing. As such, it involves a combination of practices — research, reading, representation and technique – often encountered separately, yet whose combination and synthesis is essential to understanding the limits and possibilities of contemporary urban representation.The course is divided into three four-week modules, each of which deals with specific technologies, techniques, and conceptual approaches around drawing the city; mapping, drawing, and their graphic synthesis. Each module will contain a combination of critical and historical reading, precedent studies, software workshops, and the production/revision of drawings. The course is open to students with all levels of experience and from all backgrounds by interview with the instructor.  This seminar focuses on video media and filmic mode of representation, Emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century as an unprecedented means of capturing time, cinema, at its best, attempts to delineate “time” -- makes visible or comprehensible “temporal dimension.”  According to Bergson, “time, identified as duration in the impetus given to consciousness by sensation, links the past, present, and future in a seamless continuum”1.

In the first week of each theme, we will consider specific embodiments of queer theory; in the second, we will explore the mediating role of space in the formation of identities, through case studies at scales extending from the domestic interior to the transnational territory: Part I: thresholds: Spaces of queer theory  Part II: transsections: Transgender histories and architectures Part III: dis/embodiments: Queering disability: Rethinking “standards” and universal design Part IV: visibilities: Queer visibilities: Pinkwashing, gentrification, and activism Part V: un/natures Queer ecologies: Unnatural subjects and the urban/rural divide. Part VI: queer necropolitics: The carceral city and LGBTQ abolition movements Conclusion: futurities: Activism and queer spaces of political imaginationThe course is open to graduate students (Arch 239) and upper division undergraduates (Arch 139). Students of all academic disciplines, orientations and identities are welcome to take part. Course requirements include weekly reading responses, a class presentation and a creative/research project.Research Methods in Building Science. Three hours of lecture/seminar per week. Prerequisites: Building Science MS/PhD, MArch, BA in Architecture and MS/PhD in Engineering students or consent of instructor. This interactive class provides training in research skills and critical thinking in the field of Building Science and Technology, with a focus on energy use, indoor environmental quality, and human well-being, comfort, and productivity. Readings will cover both building science theory and research methods, and classes will be organized around a series of individual and group homework. Topics will include literature review, the design of both lab-based and field experiments, physical measurements, post occupancy evaluation, statistical analysis and interpretation of data, data visualization and methods of enhancing the spread and impact of scientific results (Wikipedia editing and public presentations).  Throughout, we will discuss ways in which research can influence the design and operation of buildings, including through building standards and codes.  Depending on the status of students’ thesis work or research interest, there will be opportunities to develop your research plans with a specific focus on building science methodology. All graduate students with some knowledge of building science and an interest in related methods of inquiry are warmly welcomed. The main aim of this course is to provide students with knowledge and abilities to: 1) plan, develop, execute, interpret, and spread research in the building science/energy field; and 2) develop fact/data-based answers to design questions concerning impact of the built environment on humans, energy consumption, and sustainability. Presentations by leaders in the Bay Area professional community on a variety of topics related to green buildings, offering perspectives from the fields of architecture, engineering, consulting, urbanism, and research.  We have a stellar line-up of dynamic speakers who have been keynote speakers at a variety of venues - it’s as if we’re bringing the conference to you!  So why not end the week with a bit of decompression, enjoy some insights some of the leading professionals in our industry.  The class can be taken for variable units.  For 1 unit, there is required weekly attendance, reading, and one end-of-semester written assignment (details will be on the bSpace site).  For 2 units, there will be additional writing assignments. A bSpace site will be available as the semester approaches - look there for the Schedule of Speakers (under Syllabus), and for more information about the writing assignments for 2 units (under Assignments)."Introduction to Acoustics"This is a five week module class and will run from 25 August through 29 September 2017. "Healthy Buildings"This is a five week module class And will run from 29 Sept through 27 October 2017The UN Declaration on Human Rights states, “healthyenvironments are a human right”. But what are healthy environments, and how do we design healthy environments for all and know that they are working as intended? This course will look at the elements of healthy environments, including physical characteristics such as indoor air quality, lighting, materials, as well as psychological and sociological characteristics of comfort, privacy, and control. Lectures and case studies will look at a range of building types, such as student apartments, housing for the elderly, schools, workplaces, and communities. Students will have readings, short in-class assignments, homework, and one project. "Data Science for the Built Environment"This is a five week module class And will run from 3 Novemberr to 1 December 2017With the rapid growth of the application of sensing technologies and automation devices in the built environments, the management of these data streams and extracting valuable information has become a challenging task. This course provides an introduction to data management systems such as  elational databases and filtering methods and focuses on supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods with applications to the built environments. This class also focuses on practical and effective applications of a wide range of data mining and machine learning techniques to a variety of real-world problems in the field of the design and operation of buildings. "Flexible Hybrid Structures "This class lies at the intersection of design, architecture, engineering, and computer science and aims to attract students from across the campus. In this interdisciplinary framework, students will explore the design possibilities that emerge from combining soft, flexible, and elastic materials with bespoke 3D-printed joinery.The topics in this class will include a general introduction to bending-active structures and a special focus on hybrid systems that either combine different materials or take advantage of highly differentiated material characteristics. In small teams, students will investigate inspirational case studies of bending and folding principles in nature and technology and present the underlying mechanisms and possible range of applications to their colleagues in the class. Based on this knowledge, students will conduct physical experiments, which explore the idea of using large elastic deformations of initially straight or planar rods and plates in order to generate and stabilize geometrically complex shapes. In parallel to these physical experiments, students will also learn how to recreate their designs by using digital form-finding simulations. By synchronizing their hands-on tests with digital simulations, the students will be able to follow an iterative design process and explore the larger design space of flexible structures and mechanisms. . This seminar will reevaluate of the material nature of buildings by studying and understanding construction details and the new technologies that are revolutionizing design construction and labor relations in architecture. Nowhere in architecture is bodily contact felt more readily than in realm of detail. Small when compared to a building’s overall mass, details should be considered the building’s basic genetic in-print determining not just the architecture’s
appearance but also its performance. Each detail contributes to the meaning of the whole and simultaneously represents a microcosm of the larger entity. For Le Corbusier this idea could be traced back to nature where the smallest cell determines the validity of the whole.
Through dedicated lectures by local practitioners, research, analysis, and interpretation of case studies and self generated design investigations we
will explore and understand formal and material innovation and the increasingly global nature of architectural practice; consultants, suppliers, and fabricators as well as the understanding of the critical role of computers in architecture. Finally we will also discuss the ethical dimension of detailing as the choice of materials and their combination has a potential impact on world resources, environments, and economy.Structure
The course is structured in three parts:
1) Discussions of essays by scholars and practitioners an detailing, practice and materials
2) A series of lectures by Bay Area practitioners focused on detailing work in their practices
3)An  in depth case-study  of significant buildings focusing on design ethos of the architect practice , construction
technique, materials leading to the design and the making of  one 1: 1 detail intended to develop and advance your mown design work.TASKS.
1)Weekly reading response Attendance and Participation in Discussions
You are required to prepare a brief response of three critical questions to all of the assigned readings of no more
than 150 words, which you may be asked to read aloud at the start of the class discussions each week. Your
response should not be a summary; rather it should present critical issues/questions the reading has raised for you.
You may also use it to suggest connections/conflicts with previous readings, or perhaps establish a link with work
you are doing in other courses. A copy of your response must be submitted at the beginning of each class. These
will form an integral part of the final grade you receive for class participation. Attendance is mandatory. Regular,
enthusiastic and informed participation in class discussions is an important part of your contribution to the class.2)CASE Studies Leading to the construction of one detail:
Choose buildings case studies that are of interest to you and that will lead to the 1:1 design a detail it may be a different scale depending on the chosen detail).
    
.Focus on the different assemblies/materials
a) Give us a general context, site and climatic context
b) General architectural context of the architect work. Illustrate the building identify the detail’s location/s
c) Present the details in 11X14” sheets of paper (as many as necessary )presented horizontally. Include a graphic
scale.
d) Choose the case studies with some thesis or subject in mind; for example the staging of parts, de-mountability, ergonomics,
accessibility, economy, durability or serial applicability. This seminar looks at the implications of off-site fabrication in architecture: consistent, protected environments; worker efficiency and safety; coordination of trades; cheaper, semi-skilled labor; construction periods shortened; and completion dates more predictable. Off-site fabrication can allow for increased refinement and trial assemblies. However, it may also create monotonous sameness when the processes and results are not considered with care. Prerequisites: 160/ 260 Introduction to Construction or consent of instructor. This seminar looks at the implications of off-site fabrication in architecture: consistent, protected environments; worker efficiency and safety; coordination of trades; cheaper, semi-skilled labor; construction periods shortened; and completion dates more predictable. Off-site fabrication can allow for increased refinement and trial assemblies. However, it may also create monotonous sameness when the processes and results are not considered with care.This seminar will take a closer look at the implications of off-site fabrication in architectural production. It will move through three steps: in the initial weeks, we will look at precedents for off-site fabrication in architecture and construction, establishing an intellectual framework for subsequent work. Following this, we will look more closely at some common opportunities for off-site fabrication today. Finally, students will present their own research on local fabrication opportunities. This research will include a detailed report on fabrication opportunities, based on your interviews with architects and fabricators.During the course of the semester, readings and visits to fabricators should allow sufficient opportunity for everyone to develop a clear sense of the way off-site fabrication fits into architectural production. I hope we will also begin to develop a sense of what is unique about San Francisco's fabrication community. I have begun to understand local opportunities during the past few years, but I still have much to learn and am looking forward to you teaching me.Students are not expected to have practice or construction experience for this class, although those who do will have an advantage. By the end of the semester, you should expect to have developed an understanding of the various ways that off-site fabrication fits within design and construction systems, from approaches that cheapen design to those that result in refined architectural output."Case Studies in Modern Architecture"This survey of the “built discourses” of modern architecture reviews attempts to define modernity as a mode of design practice and a way of life. Through case studies of individual buildings, lectures examine developments in style, theory, graphic representation, construction technology and interior programming. "Architecture and Innovation" This course is required  for all students enrolled in the Studio One program. Some seats may be available for interested graduate students. Please contact the instructor for more information.When we look at housing developments where identical single-family homes are repeated for miles, it is difficult to think of innovation as a key factor in architectural production. On the other hand, if we think of the work of most architects, innovation – driven by a mix of the architect’s ideas, use of new materials, technological advances, new production processes, and changes in their socio-economic context– is always sought after. Often, though, architectural innovation remains only as an idea on paper, or as one-of-the-kind product, even when intended to respond to a broader market.
The latter case is the topic of this seminar. The seminar is organized around case studies (selected and developed with the students) of architectural innovations that ‘failed’. The case studies should not be utopian proposals with no chance of being produced. Rather, they should be ideas, proposals, and actual buildings that while based on seemingly good ideas aimed to a broad market, remained “one-off”. his seminar is aimed at introducing two different ways of dealing with space. The first mode —utopian thought— has been around for long time and, at least since the “socialist utopians” of the industrial revolution, has been a key influence on urban design and planning. The first part of this course will focus on these attempts and on the influence that they still have on present days urban planning and design. Beginning with a discussion on the concept of utopia, the class will then look at the influence of utopian thought in several contemporary urban and planning case studies.
The second mode of thinking is suggested by the recent emergence of the concept of heterotopia. While utopias deal largely with physical space, this concept points at the existence of "other spaces" that coexist and overlap with the physical environment and create a multiple layering of spatial meanings, conflicts, and uses. Taking heterotopia as its starting point, in the second part of the seminar we'll discuss the characteristics of these social spaces and look for examples of it. Many California architects came from other places: Maybeck from New York via the  Ecole Des Beaux Arts; Schindler and Neutra from Vienna; Frank Gehry from Chicago. But, once they arrived, their encounters with the Golden State produced new and original forms of architecture. This seminar will examine the qualities of the state’s environment, culture, economy, and population that have produced unique buildings and landscapes during the 20th century. We will look at both Northern and Southern California, starting with canonical designers then moving beyond them to consider lesser-known regional architects whose work embodies local characteristics. We will base our investigations on existing research but even more on direct experience of buildings and an understanding of their capacity to respond to regional considerations such as history, climate, landscape and culture. The course is organized around lectures, discussion of the readings and student presentations.During the period from 1950 to 1980, new highway programs, the spread of automobile ownership, economic growth, and more people on the move produced a uniquely American roadside landscape. Roadside strips appeared, lined with monumental signs and billboards, with buildings and parking lots designed to capture automobile traffic.  Cultural commentators from Lewis Mumford to first lady Ladybird Johnson were appalled by these chaotic landscapes, an attitude summed up by Peter Blake’s 1964 diatribe, God’s Own Junkyard. Well-known geographers analyzed “Visual Blight in America.” With a few exceptions such as the work of J.B. Jackson, such negative readings dominated until the 1972 appearance of Learning from Las Vegas by Robert Venturi, Denise Scott-Brown and Steven Izenour. They argued for a newly positive and analytical perspective on mobility and the commercial vernacular.  Replaced by limited-access Interstates, these roadside landscapes are now objects for retrospective nostalgia. 
This research seminar will explore the cultural, social, and spatial contexts and significance of these landscapes, focused around a series of documentary photographs of roads and roadside scenes taken by J.B. Jackson, David Lowenthal, Richard Longstreth and Chester Liebs from 1950 to 1970 and recently exhibited in Montpellier, France.  
After several introductory classes surveying the basic literature on the topic, ranging from Jackson, Blake and Venturi, Scott-Brown and Izenour to Vladimir Nabokov, students will select their own related research topic. Possible topics include novelistic and filmic representations, ‘New Topographic’ photography, mobility, tourism, architecture, etc. The information and interpretations students produce will become supplementary material for an exhibition based on the collection of photographs, to open in Spring, 2018. This is the introductory course in methods of inquiry in architecture research to be required of all entering Ph.D. students in all areas of the program. The purpose is to train students in predissertation and prethesis research strategies, expose them to variety of inquiry methods including the value of scholarly research, the nature of evidence, critical reading as content analysis and writing, presenting and illustrating scholarship in the various disciplines of architecture. This course situates case studies in architectural research in relation to major intellectual debates in the Anglo-American academic system since 1945. Weekly readings and discussions onnect specific approaches represented in our course texts to influential paradigms of research epistemology and practice in the humanities and social sciences on the Berkeley campus and beyond. As part of our effort to understand the relationship between architectural research and the wider context of intellectual debates, faculty and students will collaborate on the production of a temporal knowledge map, to be used as a resource in our seminar discussions and in student research projects. Both faculty and students will situate their research interests in relation to the map, connecting our respective scholarly positions to wider fields of debate in the department and on campus.
 
The course is team taught, with all six members of the HTS faculty resident in the Department in the Fall of 2017 taking part. Each faculty member leads a two-week module of the class. The modules are organized thematically, around faculty teaching and research interests, providing students with an introduction to the collective breadth and intellectual differences within our program. The first week of each module creates an intellectual context for the analysis of a major text in the second week. The readings employed to frame each of the major texts will also assist us in constructing bridges to our knowledge map of the Berkeley campus. In the process, students will gain an understanding of the richness and potential of campus debates, their histories and global connections. Weekly assignments (described in further detail below) will mix close readings of texts with attention to wider intellectual, social and historical issues.ARCH 299 [Staff]

Research topics are described further on the pages for each area. Also, research topics outside of these fields, or combinations of several areas, may be undertaken subject to approval of the applicable departmental committees and if supported by qualified departmental faculty members.Berkeley's undergraduate program in architecture leads to the bachelor of arts (B.A.) degree. The program combines required courses in environmental design and architecture with opportunities for highly varied individual programs. Through its core courses, the program offers a broad introduction to the field of architecture, and through studies in the various areas it provides opportunities to prepare for specialization in the field in the areas of architectural design and representation, architectural technologies and building performance, architectural history, and society and culture. In addition to offering a sound and well-rounded education, undergraduate studies can also provide pre-professional competency for entry-level employment in architecture, the option for graduate work in architecture, or further studies in a related environmental design field.Some graduates go on to obtain professional degrees in architecture or in other related fields; many others work in architectural practice, construction, government, or industry. Employment opportunities exist also at the community level, particularly in those communities that traditionally have not been served by professional architectural practice. The overall aim of the undergraduate program is to establish a strong foundation for a diversity of careers and to provide for mobility and flexibility to suit changing individual opportunities.All undergraduates follow the same path through their junior year. In the first two years, students take a breadth of lower-division courses and the introductory environmental design courses. The junior year is architecture-intensive. In the fall semester, students take a design studio and a history and humanities option. In the spring, the required courses include another studio, a course in history and a technology option.During the spring semester of the junior year, students choose either a design research track or a studio track for the senior year.The design research track option explores a particular theme for both the fall and spring semesters of the senior year. This theme changes each year, and is taught by a group of faculty members on a subject of their shared interest. For the fall semester, students enroll in a design research preparation seminar, and for the spring semester, students take a studio — led by the same faculty — in which they develop their research and explorations, culminating in a design project and documented in a pamphlet.See the ARCH 102A Project Track Preparation Seminar course description on the architecture fall courses page for the current project track description.The studio track option is studio-intensive, with more architecture courses required in addition to a design studio each semester. Studio-track students enroll in a structures course in the fall, and choose between an energy and environment or construction course in the spring.The B.A. degree is a pre-professional degree and provides the foundation for entry to a Master of Architecture program, the most widespread professional degree program in architecture in the United States. The B.A. degree can also be applied toward licensing requirements in the State of California. See the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) for more information on accreditation. See the California Architects Board and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) for more information on licensing.For licensing in California, the four-year Bachelor of the Arts in architecture (BA) has an experiential equivalent of 3 1/2 years (maximum credits allowed).

	The Undergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI) is a campuswide initiative to support departments in establishing educational goals and evaluation procedures for all undergraduate programs. As a result of the initiative, faculty and students have a shared understanding of the purpose of the major and what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study. The initiative is in keeping with the fundamental principle at Berkeley that the evaluation of student achievement should be locally defined, discipline specific, and faculty-driven.
	In its recent curriculum discussions, the faculty strongly supports a liberal arts education for undergraduates that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the department is that all courses are framed with this perspective. In addition to this goal, the department is introducing students to the discipline specific areas of knowledge that are needed by students who apply for graduate school in architecture.
	The discipline of architecture covers a wide range of discipline-specific subject areas that are integrated in the process of design.
	The goal of the undergraduate major is to make students familiar with and curious about engagement in and production of the built environment in historical, critical, technical, and social dimensions. The possibilities open to graduates in the major are broad, and this challenges the department to locate the terrain that is common to various aspects of the discipline as a formulation of the core lower-division courses, and then to offer at the upper division a set of “streams” of study, each of which inspires and prepares students to pursue a future endeavor. As these future endeavors cover a wide range of possibilities, there are several ways to view the undergraduate major: as a liberal arts education through the lens of architecture, perhaps leading to another course of study; as preparation for work in the profession with only an undergraduate degree; and as preparation for follow-up study at the graduate level in the discipline of architecture. Acceptance into strong graduate architecture programs requires a high level of proficiency in the core areas of the curriculum. In recent debates on the undergraduate curriculum, the faculty decided that the undergraduate major should continue to provide courses appropriate for students on each of these paths.
	The curriculum exposes students to five aspects of architecture and the broader field of environmental design:
	1. The Language of Architecture
	In essence, the language most particular to architecture is a graphic vocabulary that is the currency of exploration in the design studio. The mastery of this language, like the learning of any language, begins with vocabulary and grammar, and then moves on to the construction of meaning. This latter aspect is rigorously pursued in the design studio, and for those planning to go on to graduate study in architecture, a number of these upper-level studios offer an increasingly complex set of design challenges.
	In the Language of Architecture, students should learn to:
	2. The History and Theory of Architecture
	Courses in history and theory are intended to familiarize students with the development of the built environment in both western and eastern traditions, and to introduce recent and current theories of local and global importance. The introductory surveys in architectural history test students to both recognize and classify architectural styles; these courses are complemented by others that focus on the intersection of history and theory, and for which the writing of papers is the primary means of evaluation.
	In the History and Theory of Architecture, students should learn to:
	3. The Humanistic Applications of Architecture
	Many students enter this field of study in hopes of improving the conditions of the built environment as it relates to the daily life of individuals and communities. An emphasis in these aspects of the major can lead to graduate work in other disciplines, including environmental studies, law, global development and planning, and anthropology, or to a Ph.D. program in architecture.
	In the Humanistic Applications of Architecture, students should learn to:
	4. The Science and Technology of Architecture
	How buildings stand up, how they operate to distribute and control light and air, and the materials and connections with which they are made bring the understanding of the discipline from its paper representations of design and theory into the physical world. A set of core courses introduces students to the fundamentals of these areas, and a set of upper-division seminars allows more in-depth explorations of aspects of each, including the testing of structural ideas through design, current attitudes and goals for a sustainable building culture, and construction practices particular to certain materials or cultures.
	In the Science and Technology of Architecture, student should learn to:
	5. Research Methods
	Students should become proficient in the processes of academic research, learning to:
	The department intends to describe the potential streams of study and the learning goals more specifically in the program descriptions on the department’s website and in other materials that introduce students to the architecture major.
	All courses are currently assessed by the students at the end of the semester, and the questions asked in those evaluations will be edited, if necessary, to reflect the learning goals. The feedback from these evaluations and from other faculty/student discussions is that the level of satisfaction of undergraduate students is generally high.
	The department plans to develop a better method of maintaining contact with students over the longer term to obtain a more accurate picture of which paths they took within the major and which paths they follow after graduation, to see if the department’s assumptions are accurate.

	The complexity of modern structures requires the design and supervision of both architects and structural engineers. The growing inter-reliance of these two disciplines creates a demand for professionals capable of viewing a possible structure both as an architect and as a structural engineer. The concurrent M.Arch. and M.S. Structural Engineering program offered by the Department of Architecture and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Division of Structural Engineering, Mechanics, and Materials enables students to obtain this valuable combination of professional disciplines with up to 24 fewer units than if the two degrees were pursued separately.

The growing inter-reliance of these two disciplines creates a demand for professionals capable of viewing a possible structure both as an architect and as a structural engineer. The concurrent M.Arch. and M.S. Structural Engineering program offered by the Department of Architecture and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Division of Structural Engineering, Mechanics, and Materials enables students to obtain this valuable combination of professional disciplines with up to 24 fewer units than if the two degrees were pursued separately.

Our faculty are leaders in the fields of design, theory, and building technologies, and are joined each year by endowed professors who teach design studios related to their professional interests. A sampling of their research is described in the Center for Environmental Design Research Projects list.The M.Arch. program provides students seeking their first accredited professional degree with a comprehensive and challenging education leading to the practice of architecture. Graduate students have the flexibility to choose a variety of paths within a two-to-three-year rigorous program, depending upon previous education and experience. The department makes no restriction as to the field of undergraduate preparation. However, the length of the required residence period, the number of required semester course units, and the specific list of required courses may vary depending upon undergraduate major, professional and other work experience, and previous graduate study, if any.The basic course leading to the Master of Architecture degree takes three academic years and requires the completion of at least 72 units during that period of residence. Persons who hold a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree with a major in architecture may receive up to one year of advanced standing. The M.Arch Admissions Committee will determine advanced standing individually for each student during the admissions review.  Special one-year Master of Architecture programs are available to persons holding the five-year, professional undergraduate degree, Bachelor of Architecture, from an accredited school, or comparable five-year degrees from foreign universities and technical institutes.During the final year, M.Arch students have the option of participating in an intensive research studio or developing an individual thesis. Both options include a required seminar component in the fall followed by a spring studio.In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.The University of California, Berkeley, College of Environmental Design, Department of Architecture, offers the following NAAB-accredited degree programs:The most recent NAAB accreditation visit for all programs was 2016.For licensing in California, our 2- and 3-year, NAAB-accredited Masters of Archtitecture degree has an experiential equivalent of 5 years (maximum credits allowed). Candidates eligible as of January 1, 2005 or after are subject to IDP/IAP requirements.

Please see the California Architects Board website for more information about experience equivalents.The application cycle for the Master of Architecture program opens in September. Admission is for the fall semester of the following year. We do not accept spring-semester admissions. Please see Graduate Admissions for application deadlines and procedures.Students admitted to the Master of Architecture program are required to have taken college-level or equivalent calculus and introductory physics, including mechanics. These prerequisites must be completed by the time you enter (not apply to) the graduate program. At the very latest, you must take the courses in the summer preceding fall-semester entry. We will accept a calculus or physics course from any community college or university. We will accept a physics course taken without a lab. Students must pass these courses with a grade of at least a C minus. For those who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus or Physics in high school, the following scores will satisfy the prerequisites: 5 on the AP Calculus AB exam or at least a 3 on the AP Calculus BC exam; at least a 3 on the AP Physics B exam.The three-year Master of Architecture program is open to applicants with a B.A. or B.S. degree in any field.The core of the Master of Architecture curriculum is the design studio, and students admitted to the program plunge right into the studio regimen their first semester. The ability to draw and sketch is essential. Although no prerequisite coursework in this area is required, applicants are strongly encouraged to take studio art and/or a beginning design course in preparation for applying.The admissions committee looks for evidence that you have an aptitude for architecture and that Berkeley's program would be a good place for you to develop that aptitude. The ability to "conceptualize," think three-dimensionally, and communicate effectively both verbally and visually, plus some understanding of the architecture profession, is essential. If your academic preparation is in another field, it is important to incorporate into your statement why you have decided to move from your present field to architecture. What connections do you see bridging your past experiences with architecture?The opportunity to complete the Master of Architecture program with Advanced Standing in two years is granted to students with an exceptional undergraduate record in a focused pre-professional degree, including the B.A. or B.S. with a major in architecture. The advanced standing is at the discretion of the admissions committee, based on both studio work and academic achievement.(1) Admissions Criteria: complete description of application review & ranking process.Applicants to the Master of Architecture degrees are evaluated in three main areas:1. Statement and Letters (Evaluate applications in relation to: Diverse experiences, commitment to the discipline, potential for leadership);2. Academic Record (Evaluate applications in relation to: Curricular choices, scholastic achievement, potential to success in required coursework);3. Portfolio* (Evaluate application in relation to: Spatial sensibility, graphic clarity and creativity, potential as a designer) Relative weight given to the criteria:
Each of the three is weighted equally.Approximate schedule of the review cycle:
Deadline for submission for applications: Mid-December
First phase review: End of January
Second phase review: End of February
Final Decisions: Early March
All decisions to Graduate Division by March 15Ranking SystemFirst Phase: The M.Arch Admissions Committee members each review a portion of the applicant pool using the criteria listed above and ranking them from 1(weak) to 5(strong) and make a recommendation to either admit/review/deny. The cumulative scores are the basis of a ranking and about a third of the highest ranked applicants move on to the next phase where they are reviewed by additional members of the faculty.Second Phase: The applicants who move forward are then reviewed by two faculty reviewers using the same criteria and ranking method as above. Their cumulative scores create a numerical ranking which produce the final ranked list from which the M. Arch Admissions Committee selects the new students.Third Phase: The M.Arch Admissions Committee reviews the top half of the list to fill the department spaces assigned by the Graduate Division. The Committee uses the numbers, recommendations, and written comments from faculty reviewers. Again, the committee reviews each applicant in the three areas above and in relation to all the top ranked applicants to make the final admission decisions. The committee also considers the background and strengths that each individual can contribute to their entering class. This process allows students with varied backgrounds and emphasis into the program to support and maintain the different areas of interests we provide. For Graduate Division admissions ranking purposes, applicants will ultimately be in either:
Group A:  1-A; 2-A; or 3-A which signifies Program and Admit, or
Group D:  1-D; 2-D; or 3-D which signifies Program and DenyReview Committee Members:
The Admissions Committee is composed of members of the M.Arch Committee and includes the Chair of Graduate Advisors. It is a standing committee of approximately four to five members appointed by the Chair of the Department.GRE requirement:
Domestic applicants and those who attend universities where English is the language of instruction must take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) (general test) and have their scores reported to the Graduate Division by the Educational Testing Service.
The deadline to take the exam is November 30.Applicants from countries where English is not the official language must submit official evidence of English language profiecency. There are two standardized tests you may take: the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The deadlines for taking these exams is November 30.*The portfolio provides you the opportunity to show your creative ability. It need not necessarily be all architecture-related. In fact, if you have no experience in this area you would be wise to confine the examples to your best work, regardless of the media. The best results will emerge if you think of your exhibit in its entirety as a design project. The reviewers hope to see your projects displayed in a well-thought-out format, carefully executed. Most importantly, leave yourself plenty of time to think about and develop your creative work.The application cycle for the Master of Architecture program opens in September.

The building profession now requires a wider range of expertise in design, operation, and management than was required in the past, and new types of professional specialists have emerged to provide this expertise. Often these experts are educated outside of traditional architectural programs, frequently through studies in other disciplines.The Master of Science (M.S.) in Architecture is an academic, nonprofessional degree program that offers the opportunity for advanced research in the ever-broadening and increasingly complex subfields within architecture. Some students enter with a degree in architecture, or occasionally while here will get an additional Master of Architecture degree (the professional degree accredited for the practice of architecture).  But neither is required, and the undergraduate degrees of our entering M.S. students are diverse.The M.S. degree emphasizes course work and supervised independent research in one the following areas of study:Research topics outside of these fields or combinations of several areas may be proposed at the time of admission, or developed while in the program, if supported by qualified departmental faculty members, and subject to approval of the architecture M.S./Ph.D. committee.  Course work is individually developed through consultation with an academic adviser.The following are members of the M.S. - Ph.D faculty.

The environmental attributes studied (thermal, luminous, air quality, acoustic) have both physical and psychological dimensions. The intellectual objective of graduate research in building science is uncovering the processes by which a building affects its occupants, evaluating the human/economic/energy consequences of the effects, and incorporating this knowledge in new procedures to design more acceptable buildings.A secondary objective is to prepare the student for a career involving building science, by having them participate in important funded research ongoing at Berkeley, and by engaging them in the activities of the professional societies where research is presented, debated, and put into forms that influence design practice.Environmental requirements for occupant: health, satisfaction, comfort, and productivity. We have worked extensively on thermal comfort standards appropriate for energy-conserving building design, on lighting and are also involved in ventilation and air quality standards. We have also developed climatic requirements for pedestrian safety and comfort in the outdoor environment.Design of climatically-adapted buildings that conserve energy and that may help preserve (in naturally heated, cooled, lit and ventilated buildings) long-standing architectural traditions and patterns of habitation. Although the general principles by which such buildings operate are well-known, it is very difficult to predict their actual performance in terms acceptable to a designer. We have developed a number of computerized design methods to help put climatically-adapted architectural and energy efficient mechanical systems on a quantified footing.Integrated and personalized conditioning systems to improve the energy efficiency and living quality in buildings, both at the large commercial and the residential scale. Our past work has concentrated on heating and ventilating, lighting, windows and glazing, and new solutions that provide occupants with control of their personal environments. We work on radiant and underfloor air distribution systems. We also develop technology and post occupancy survey techniques with which one can diagnose how well a building is performing.Innovative structures and new fabrication techniques that transform the way buildings are designed, built, and operated. With this pioneering area, we are investigating a different approach to design and construction that integrates hitherto neglected structural behaviors such as bending and buckling as potential form-giving strategies for flexible and adaptive structural systems. By incorporating emerging building technologies such as elastic structures, smart materials, and 3D printing, we are exploring the potential of producing mass-customized functional parts that are tailor-made for their task and can provide a time and material-efficient alternative to traditional construction processes.  Parametric and generative design methods to support architects in designing sustainable buildings from early design stages. Design decisions with higher impact on future building energy consumption are typically made at conceptual stages. However, it has been difficult to develop ways to integrate energy and sustainability into those architecture design workflows. Taking advantage of recent developments in computational approaches, such as parametric and generative design, optimization through heuristics, and new evaluation metrics in daylighting and comfort, we develop innovative ways for early deployment of sustainability knowledge into pedagogical and professional practice.  Design and simulation in immersive environments allow architects to design and modify buildings within Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) platforms. Following the creation of our AR/VR Architecture laboratory, we are developing methods to support interactive design in immersive environments, and to simulate environmental factors from inside VR models. Using state-of-the-art, research grade simulation software, our platforms enable architects to get immediate and accurate feedback on the impact of design decisions on the sustainability performance of their buildings.Coursework is largely decided on an individual basis through consultation between the student and his or her advisor. In general, each student will be required to develop competence in a range of building science, technology and sustainability topics that border the main topic of interest. Students often participate in research projects conducted by the faculty for external sponsors. Thesis research can be structured in many ways, but must be based on an appropriate combination of theory, modeling, digital simulation, physical prototyping, and testing in the laboratory or field.The following are members of the Ph.D faculty who focus on the subject area of Building Science, Technology and Sustainability.

	Students may situate their research interest in the comprehensive area of History, Theory and Society, or may choose concentrations in Environmental Design & Urbanism in Developing Countries or Social and Cultural Processes in Architecture & Urban Design.
	The Environmental Design and Urbanism in Developing Countries concentration emphasizes an understanding of how the physical environment, in so-called “third world” nations is shaped by larger global, cultural, historic, social and economic forces.
	
	Unlike similar areas of study in other schools the Berkeley program is premised on two interlinked concepts: first, that the study of other cultures, societies, and peoples is a fundamental exercise for the creation of a better physical environment, and, second, that the first world can learn from the experiences of the third world as much as it can contribute to it.
	
	The area is conceived as a horizontal link between the different areas of the curriculum within and outside the department. Courses offered in the concentration are often classified under Social and Cultural Processes, History of Architecture, City and Regional Planning, and Global Metropolitan Studies. Enrolled students are also expected to take courses in the departments of Anthropology, Geography, History, Sociology or International and Area Studies as needed. Topics being pursued in this area include third world urbanization, urbanism, squatting, informal housing, colonial and post-colonial urban development, and traditional dwellings and settlements. The International Association for the Study of Traditional Environments, based in the College of Environmental Design, serves as the research arm of this area of emphasis.
	The following faculty are members of the M.S. - Ph.D. committee and serve on M.S. thesis and Ph.D. dissertation committees. Please also review the current list of all faculty in the Architecture Department.
	Social research in a professional school of architecture often focuses on serving the profession, but it can also serve as a form of cultural criticism in the tradition of the humanities.  Social research supports the profession through programming and evaluation research--those close observations of reality that can inspire new designs and refine existing paradigms. Alternatively, social research gives us the distance to stand back and observe what society is producing through its architecture and to comment on the wisdom or folly entailed.
	Contemporary social research helps the designer conceptualize and learn about the needs of different people in different roles. At first, much of the research in the US emphasized this behavioral level of analysis, but it has expanded over the last 45 years to include other levels. Accordingly, the field of person-environment studies now includes organizational, institutional, societal and cultural levels of analysis.
	As the research field has expanded, methods have also expanded. Because studies can be behavioral, organizational, institutional, and/or societal and cultural, methods are correspondingly varied. Increasingly, social researchers in architecture use qualitative, interpretive, and critical approaches to describe, analyze, understand, critique, and even advocate, while others might use quantitative and behavioral approaches to help resolve social-environmental problems in a wide array of settings.

Graduation Date: 1972 The Center for Environmental Design Research (CEDR) is a center that fosters research in environmental planning and design, ranging from the local environments of people within buildings to region-wide ecosystems, Research at CEDR is highly interdisciplinary utilizing skills and knowledge of people across campus in civil & environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering & computer science, public health, public policy, psychology, business, energy & resources, and more. The Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD) is a center that aims to critically investigate and help improve processes and outcomes that shape urban equity around the world through the collaborative and interdisciplinary research of students, faculty, and visiting scholars. Over its long history, IURD has sponsored research in numerous disciplines. Principal research areas involve creating inclusive cities, urban governance, healthy cities, place and mobility, understanding city science, and urban environment. In all of its research projects, IURD emphasizes interdisciplinary and cooperative study. As the first school to combine the disciplines of architecture, planning, and landscape architecture into a single college, CED was also among the first to conceptualize environmental design as inseparable from its social, political-economic, and cultural contexts. Across all three departments, CED’s faculty research local and global challenges with this unique concept of environmental design in mind. One of the premier architecture, landscape architecture, and city and regional planning libraries in North America, the Environmental Design Library includes more than 210,000 volumes and subscriptions, as well as thousands of electronic resources from around the world used to support the teaching and research programs of the College of Environmental Design. CED’s library contains a myriad of department specific collections, rare and limited edition books and original reproductions, as well as reference and research services provided by CED’s friendly and knowledgeable librarians.  The Environmental Design Archives holds more than 200 collections documenting the built and landscaped environment. These records span more than a century, 1890-2014, and contain primary source materials such as correspondence, reports, specifications, drawings, photographs, models, and artifacts. The Archives holds records of not only California’s early important architects, but also contemporary and lesser-known architects and designers from around the world.  The Visual Resources center is a library of teaching and research images, with over 82,000 digital images, over 300,000 35mm slides, and 37,000 lantern slides depicting architecture, landscapes, cities, and related material. In addition to the Center’s extensive collection of images, it also provides services that help faculty and students create digital images for classroom use, create digital images from slides or archival material, and to create digital version of 35mm slides and Lantern slides in the Center’s collection for teaching use.  The Cal Design Lab at Wurster Hall is an experimental studio space that promotes hands-on, interdisciplinary design activities. Faculty and students from UC Berkeley’s many schools and departments come together at the Cal Design Lab to work on critical design challenges. The goal of the lab is to be a nexus for design research and practice, and to facilitate discourse that transcends different design disciplines. The lab offers formal space for transdisciplinary seminars and projects, as well as informal space for student teams to work and interact with design coaches or mentors. Bio-inspired imagagery from the Studio One Program Studio One is a one-year post-professional program for students with an accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree. A two-semester studio course makes up the core of the program intended for those interested in exploring innovative and experimental design issues through a research-oriented and multidisciplinary approach. It is supplemented by seminars, lectures, and workshops in architectural design, engineering, and natural sciences with the opportunity to take electives at the College of Environmental Design. Students who complete the program will receive a post-professional Master of Architecture degree.Building on the positive experience of the previous year, Studio One will once again have the theme Bio-inspired Design and Fabrication and be directed by Assistant Professor Simon Schleicher. The goal of the studio is to pioneer a new design approach that arises from knowledge and experience of multiple disciplines and to deepen our newly established collaborations with academic and industry partners. Studio One seeks to forge interdisciplinary and cross-professional alliances to provoke a novel design paradigm based on the integration of multifaceted methodologies and informed processes. The main focus in this respect will be on re-examining and merging the areas of biomimetics, computational design, structural analysis, material-based fabrication and construction.The studio will follow an inquiry-oriented, experiment-based, and project-driven research agenda. Based on an intensive, critical, and analytical approach to cutting-edge design and construction methods, the studio aims to go one step further by taking inspiration from flexible and resilient structures found in nature. By closely investigating biological role models in the plant and insect world for their efficiency and adaptability and by abstracting their underlying construction principles into suitable architectural systems, the studio will challenge our present understanding with new bio-inspired fabrication and construction concepts. Studio One students will design and fabricate models and large-scale demonstrations that showcase the potential of biologically informed design concepts that anticipate a new foundation for lightweight, multifunctional, and sustainable architecture.Simon is an architectural designer, researcher, and educator from Germany. He is a member of a new research team Design Innovation from Nature.Simon aims to transfer bending and folding mechanisms found in plant movements to elastic systems in architecture In his research on bio-inspired compliant mechanisms. He was project manager for the first ICD/ITKE Research Pavilion 2010, which won the DETAIL prize and was nominated for the Mies van der Rohe Award. With his work, Simon has won further awards including the Gips-Schüle-Forschungspreis, the International Bionic-Award, the Ralph Adam Cram Award, the Imre Halasz Thesis Prize, the British Institution Award, and the Pininfarina-Förderpreis. During his study, Simon was recipient of a Merit-Based Full-Tuition Scholarship at MIT and received grants from the DAAD and from the prestigious German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes).Building on last year's research, Studio One 2017-18 will once again focus on the topic of Bio-inspired Design and Fabrication and thereby venture out into the unchartered territory between architecture, engineering, and biology.  The studio's main goal is to gain knowledge from the analysis of living systems to find solutions to problems, create new inventions and innovations, and transfer this knowledge to building and architectural systems. Even though nature cannot be directly copied, the living world can provide architects and engineers with a wealth of analogues and inspirations for their own creative designs. The basic motivation behind the transfer of biological solutions to technical applications is the assumption that optimized biological structures have been developed in the course of 3.8 billion years of evolution that could also be significant and convincing in technical development. Nature has numerous
“ingenious solutions” available that can often be understood intuitively. However, it is seldom easy to explain the underlying mechanism, and in particular to explain how these principles can be applied to technology. It is this discrepancy that makes the field of bio-inspired design and fabrication so relevant for the future.  In order to shed light on this question, the studio seeks to forge new interdisciplinary alliances and cross-professional partnerships. Based on this framework, the studio will bridge the areas of biomimetics, computational design, structural analysis, material-based fabrication and construction. In studio, the students will follow an inquiry-oriented, experiment-based, and project-driven research agenda. Based on an intensive, critical, and analytical approach to cutting-edge design and construction methods, the studio aims to go one step further by taking inspiration from the flexible and resilient structures found in plants and insects. By closely investigating biological structures for their efficiency and adaptability as well as abstracting their underlying construction principles into suitable architectural systems, the studio will challenge our present understanding with new bio-inspired fabrication and construction concepts. In the program's first semester, the students will mainly work individually and in small groups. During the second semester, the students will join forces to push one idea into a bigger scale as a team. Over the course of the program, students will design and fabricate small-scale models, mid-sized prototypes, and large-scale demonstrations that showcase the potential of bio-inspired concepts and anticipate a new foundation for a lightweight, multifunctional, and sustainable architecture.  In the last few years, Studio One has built up a network with academic research institutions, laboratories, and professionals inside and outside the building industry. Current research partners at UC Berkeley include Professor Robert Full with his poly-PEDAL Laboratory at the Department of Integrative Biology as well as Professor Ronald Fearing and his Biomimetic Millisystems Lab at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Together with these partners, Studio One is participating in the newly formed, campus-wide research initiative called Design Innovation from Nature. As part of this initiative, our students have collaborated with museums and collections including the University and Jepson Herbaria, the Essig Museum of Entomology, and UC Berkeley’s Botanical Garden. In recent field trips, Studio One students have reached out and visited inspirational offices, software developers, and manufacturers like Autodesk Pier9, Kreysler & Associates, and the Otherlab. Studio One has also found strong support from leading experts and professionals in the field of biomimetics and computational design and hosted guest lectures by Joanna Aizenberg, Jan Knippers, Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg, Mitsuhiro Kanada, Julian Lienhard, Sean Ahlquist, David Stasiuk, Josh Zabel, Andrew Wit, Simon Poppinga, Andrei Nejur, Riccardo La Magna, Valentin Koslowski, Julia Körner, Sophie Pennetier, Steffen Reichert, Anders Holden Deleuran, Enrique Soriano, Pep Tornabel, Thiemo Fildhuth, Milos Dimcic, Jan Brütting, Maria Yablonina, and Laia Mogas-Soldevila.Please visit the Design Innovation from Nature website for a list of upcoming lectures, field trips, and workshops.Bio-inspired imagagery from the Studio One Program Studio One is a one-year post-professional program for students with an accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree.

The course will be offered in the 2018-2019 academic year through UC Berkeley's College of Environmental Design. Students who complete the program will receive a post-professional Master of Architecture degree.Professor Nicholas de Monchaux with Geoff ManaughFor several hundred years, architects have abandoned the crafting of buildings to others. Instead, we devote our practice to a range of media: drawings, models, and, more recently, databases and even algorithms. These practices are explicitly, and now even more manifestly, virtual — quite literally, they exist primarily in their ability to effect. And at the core of this practice lies a relationship between truth — the surveyed conditions of reality — and fiction  — prediction and speculation on construction in the future. This balancing act is both uncomfortable and audacious. Drawing on narrative, speculative, and graphic practices, and employing a range of tools from the digital to the textual, Studio One in 2018-2019 will focus on imagining a particular set of futures for a remarkable landscape: the natural and manmade ecology of California. From the transnational landscapes of the U.S./Mexico border to the marijuana farms of Humboldt County, from the plastic dreams of Los Angeles to the silicon dreams of the San Francisco Bay Area, California is both one of the largest economies in the world and home to much of the world’s imagination about the relationship between technology, nature, and what it means to be human in the 21st century. It is also a landscape uniquely challenged by a range of contemporary forces, particularly the effects of anthropogenic climate change to technological transformations in media and labor, to a precipitous economic and social divide.For all of its influence on global culture, however, at least one more essential reason to deploy techniques of architectural speculation on this landscape is that so little memorable imprint has been made here at the building scale. California has mostly dreamed much larger and much smaller: from the sapphire-glass surfaces of intimate devices (whose connectivity spans the globe) to the heroic scale of highways and bridges, by way of the highly curated wastes and wildernesses that are this architecture’s necessary foil. Mining the rich visual and tectonic history of California dreaming — from Star Wars to psychedelia — we will construct a set of visual, spatial and architectural assertions about what it means to live at the end of a continent, at the end of drawing, at the end of nature, and at the beginning of a new relationship between architecture, media, ecology, and craft. Our chief medium will be drawing, but we will engage and embrace a world of devices and tools — from scripting through mapping and virtual reality — that are changing, and expanding, the capacity of architecture to influence the world.And so, embracing the techniques and history of world-building and  simulation from inside and outside architectural culture, yet grounded  in California’s own cultural and technological history, we will produce  instrumental speculations towards our shared future -- in California,  and in the world which California, distinctly, helps shape. Students in the one-year course will participate in a design studio taught by de Monchaux and Manaugh and receive specialized training in animation, digital fabrication, and rendering. The course will encourage students to take a variety of elective interdisciplinary classes at Berkeley. Studio guests will include legendary science fiction novelist Kim Stanley Robinson, “MythBusters” co-host Adam Savage (who began his career as a model-builder at Industrial Light and Magic), urbanist Allison Arieff, aerial photographer David Maisel, and others.Studio One is a one-year Master’s program in advanced design, offered at UC Berkeley’s College of Environmental Design since 2011 for students with an accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree. The topic and focus of the year-long program changes with each year’s director; past topics have included 3D printing, bio-inspired structures, and data-driven design.Applications for this 2018-2019 course are now being accepted. Interested students should apply online at grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply, specifying the one-year Masters of Architecture option in the College of Environmental Design.Nicholas de Monchaux is associate professor of architecture and urban design and director of the Berkeley Center for New Media.

This new Certificate Program for 2017 introduces design as the creative and critical means to innovate — to define, to imagine, and to advance a globally just future.The Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation assumes that innovation will not come from any one discipline, but rather from the meaningful integration of methods, technologies, knowledge, and thought from a wide range of different disciplines. As such, the certificate connects the design approaches and disciplines from four schools (College of Engineering, College of Environmental Design, College of Letters and Science – Arts and Humanities Division, and the Haas School of Business) to ensure that students know how to innovate. The program trains students to take responsibility for the entire life cycle of innovation, from idea to execution and beyond.Information about courses available and forms for this program are located on the BCDI curriculum page.Grand Canyon, Data from Intermap RadarThe Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) provides an academic structure for an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas around geospatial information and analysis.

Prerequisites: Open to majors in all fields.Survey of city planning as it has evolved in the United States since 1800 in response to physical, social, and economic problems; major concepts and procedures used by city planners and local governments to improve the urban environment.Introduction to City Planning is an upper division course in the Department of City and Regional Planning providing students with a study of the origins, history, and legal basis for contemporary urban planning. The course explores several key areas of planning practice in the United States including urban design, housing, transportation, and community and economic development. The course also examines key challenges and opportunities in urban planning including sustainability, environmental justice, immigration, and community health. Throughout the semester the course also examines issues of justice, equity, and access as these relate to planning practice, planning theory, and the built environment. Given the often overlooked or neglected issues related to race, class, and gender, among others, the course aims to situate these in the study of planning histories, theories, and practices to help inform a new generation of planners, advocates, and informed global citizens. Students will gain a perspective to see how these issues form the complex fabric of cities, regions, and nations, which must be considered and incorporated into planning analysis and decision-making.Economic Analysis for Planning(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.Introduction to economic concepts and thinking as used in planning. Micro-economic theory is reviewed and critiqued.This is an introductory course in the application of basic principles of economic analysis to problems of urban planning and policy. The course aims to cover the fundamentals of microeconomic theory and apply them to contemporary planning issues, including urban land use, transportation, housing, education, and economic development planning.In this course we will explore: (1) how economic forces and policies shape the formation, location, size, form, function, growth and decline of cities; (2) how the basic tools of microeconomic analysis can be used to evaluate and address city planning issues; and (3) how to analyze critically the strengths and weaknesses of various economic approaches and arguments to justify specific urban policies.The class is not intended as a comprehensive introduction to the field of microeconomics; rather, it is designed to acquaint students with the essential elements of qualitative economics that are most relevant to the practice of city planning and the study of cities. Throughout the course, we will debate the suitability of economic theories for explaining urban phenomena and guiding policy. The study of theory will be augmented by examples and exercise in applying economic analysis to current planning problems in California.(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Open to majors in all fields.This course examines how the concept of sustainable development applies to cities and urban regions and gives students insight into a variety of contemporary urban planning issues through the sustainability lens. The course combines lectures, discussions, student projects, and guest appearances by leading practitioners in Bay Area sustainability efforts. Ways to coordinate goals of environment, economy, and equity at different scales of planning are addressed, including the region, the city, the neighborhood, and the site.Major 21st century challenges around the world are leading to a renewed focus on planning: rapid urbanization along with environmental degradation and habitat loss, climate change, overcrowding and inadequate access to quality housing, services and infrastructure, and resource shortages and price spikes in food and fuel, among other worries. All of these problems have substantial implications for the present and long-term form and functioning of metropolitan regions, cities and towns. Moreover, human land use patterns are altering global ecosystems. Because these are collective problems, they require state intervention to fundamentally change the nature of urban development; and this implies the need for planning. However, in the US and many places, planning practices and urban policies for much of the 20th century worsened equitable and environmental outcomes in the pursuit of economic growth.Worries about the environmental impacts of urban development were behind the revival of interest in planning in the 1990s, with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) introducing the concept of sustainable development into planning via Local Agenda 21 initiatives. Continued urban growth, accompanied by increasing urban poverty and the formation of slums (areas without adequate water, sanitation, housing and rights of tenure) have also refocused attention on planning. As countries rapidly urbanize, the issue of sustainable cities has become an urgent focus of decision makers at every level.New approaches to planning focused on achieving sustainability at various scales (e.g. the region, city, neighborhood) can help us reduce the pace and impact of human induced climate change. We can re-shape our cities from being sprawling and car-dependent to being compact, public transport-based, with priority for pedestrian movement by focusing on transportation access vs. mobility. We can increase the availability of housing that is both affordable and ‘green’. These steps and others would go a long way towards reducing fuel demand. At the same time, planning can also play a role in identifying and eliminating spaces of environmental injustice and limiting the use of hazardous areas through land-use zoning, tax incentives, environmental remediation and the relocation of residents from high-risk areas. The planning process itself can promote inclusiveness and equity through meaningful participation and equitable decision-making criteria such as the precautionary principle.The concept of and movement towards sustainability is creating a common language and set of practices (measures, methods, goals) between the planning profession and the broader world of environmental science and management, public health, public policy, and other related fields. Historically, modern city and town planning has been an interdisciplinary field (with roots in public health, architecture, landscape architecture, housing reform and applied social sciences). The previous incarnation of planners as top-down, expert-driven, technical blueprint creators of ‘master plans’ is evolving (in some places faster than others) to cope with complex, newer forms of urbanization. Cities that ‘get it’ realize that sustainability requires planning frameworks that are inclusive, participatory, adaptive, strategic, and action-oriented. Now that the profession has embraced sustainability, new ideas and transdisciplinary connections are allowing planning to evolve and integrate with other fields for better management of urban growth.This course examines how the concept of sustainability and sustainable development applies to cities and urban regions. Students will get insight into a variety of contemporary urban planning issues, including environmental justice, through the sustainability lens. The course combines lectures, discussions, student projects, and guest speakers. Ways to coordinate goals of environment, economy, and equity at different scales of planning are addressed, including the region, the city, the neighborhood, and the site.By the end of this course, you should be able to:(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation, transportation, pollution, energy services, and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints, weak institutions, and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover, democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic, but present challenges with respect to priority setting, coordination, and corruption.To come.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.The course is concerned with the multidisciplinary field and practice of urban design. It includes a review of historical approaches to urban design and current movements in the field, as well as discussion of the elements of urban form, theories of good city form, scales of urban design, implementation approaches, and challenges and opportunities for the discipline. Learning from cities via fieldwork is an integral part of the course.To come.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.This course focuses on sustainable mobility in world cities, with an emphasis on the long-term importance of how land development can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mobility options. Integration of sustainable mobility issues into daily discussions about cities is essential to improve decisions, increase funding opportunities, raise awareness, and foster environments that are more equitable, environmentally friendly, and economically sound.Sustainable transportation systems are influenced by factors at various levels: At the micro-scale, elements of the built environment, such as sidewalks, bicycle lanes, traffic speeds, and roadway crossings, impact how people travel. At the macro-scale, where activities are located, and the transportation connections among them, determine whether one can feasibly use transit, a shared vehicle, a bicycle, or walk to a destination.  As a result, addressing sustainable transportation issues requires the bridging of many disciplines, including urban planning/design, economics, engineering, and others.The course is divided into four sections: 1. An introduction, aimed at bridging the current course with knowledge gained in CP 114 and other courses; 2. Mass Transit; 3. Bicycling and Walking; and 4. Land development as a long-term strategic choice for the success of sustainable transportation modes.By the end of the course, students will be able to:(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.The history of city planning and the city planning profession in the context of urban history. Principal focus on the evolution of North American planning practice and theory since the late 19th century; some comparative and earlier material.This course provides a survey of key themes and moments in the emergence of city planning as a discipline as well as explains the larger history of urbanism and city planning across the globe. Although some emphasis will be given to U.S. and European discourses and case studies, the course will also highlight other global and transnational connections to the influence of planning ideas and practices in general. The course partially follows a chronology, but also interrupts this chronology to highlight certain trans-historical continuities.Learning Objectives(4) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.Part one of a two-semester course sequence that introduces first-year students in the Master of City Planning (MCP) program to a suite of data collection, data analysis, problem solving, and presentation methods that are essential for practicing planners. 201A focuses on supporting integrated problem solving, using a case-based approach to introduce methods in sequenced building-blocks. 201A is a prerequisite to 201B; exceptions made with instructor approval.CP201A is the first part of a two-semester course sequence, consisting of two courses totaling eight units, that introduces first-year students in the Master of City Planning (MCP) program to a suite of data collection, data analysis, problem solving, and presentation methods that are essential for practicing planners. The course focuses on supporting integrated problem solving, using a case-based approach to introduce methods in sequenced building-blocks.  The first course, CP 201A, provides an overview of methods in planning, focusing on the analysis and presentation of secondary data. CP 201A is generally a prerequisite to CP201B, which focuses on original data collection and more advanced statistical techniques. The course also prepares MCP students for more advanced courses in statistics, GIS, urban design, qualitative methods, survey methods, and public participation.Through lectures, case studies, and assignments, students will achieve the following learning objectives:(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisites: City Planning 113A or equivalent.Examination of the interactions between transportation and land use systems; historical perspectives on transportation; characteristics of travel and demand estimation; evaluation of system performance; location theory; models of transportation and urban structure; empirical evidence of transportation-land use impacts; case study examinations. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C290U.The United States continues to grow and urbanize, and people are traveling more than ever. Building roads and highways has become more difficult and less popular, and the funding for new roads and transit systems has become more constrained. Climate change, congestion, pollution, and accidents caused by motor vehicle use are becoming more politically salient. Some even argue there is a cultural shift afoot among young adults in which auto ownership is no longer de rigeur.Meanwhile, many state and local governments in the US have been pursuing policies such as transit-oriented development, smart growth programs, urban growth boundaries, and zoning code reform. These regulatory interventions don’t require public funds, and they are thought to decrease auto use and increase walking and transit use. Economists have long argued that such efforts are relatively inefficient solutions to congestion, pollution and sprawl, but better options like road pricing and spatially efficient development impact fees have been harder to implement. Property rights advocates, along with a large share of the general public, often express opposition to smart growth and related policies.This course focuses on providing an historical and theoretical understanding of interrelationships between urban form, land development, transportation investments, and household travel, with a focus on U.S. urban areas. Does a less sprawling city lead to more transit use? Will people walk to work three blocks away if they can easily drive? Does building roads have economic benefits? As it turns out, questions like these are not simple. We spend much of the time of the course learning what is well understood and what is controversial, and how debates over current plans in the Bay Area take into account or fail to take into account this knowledge. In the last two weeks of the course, we also learn about and practice some of the classic land use and transportation planning methods.Students in the course apply what they have learned to critically reading and evaluating empirical research and policy recommendations, as evaluated by answering weekly questions about the readings; participating in class discussions; presenting a planning document and leading a class discussion about it; writing a short paper; completing a problem set; and taking a final examination.By the end of this course, students will:(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisite: Graduate standing or consent of instructorCovers pedestrian and bicycle transportation planning including benefits of active transportation, importance of urban design and network connectivity, and facility design. Examines policies and programs to support active transportation and the processes to create, implement, and evaluate bicycle and pedestrian plans.Active transportation constitutes any human-powered means of getting around, primarily through walking and bicycling. Integration of pedestrian and bicycle concerns into transportation planning is essential for creating a sustainable urban system. Pedestrian and bicycle transportation are influenced by micro-scale elements of the built environment, such as sidewalks, bicycle lanes, traffic speeds, and roadway crossings, as well as by macro-scale characteristics, such as community-wide pathway systems and regional land use and street grid patterns.  As a result, addressing active transportation issues requires the bridging of many disciplines, including urban planning/design, civil engineering, and others. This course brings experiences from professionals in many fields (both public and private) and researchers at the local and national level into the classroom to provide diverse perspectives on effective pedestrian and bicycle planning strategies. This course is designed to critically discuss the key issues affecting active transportation practice today:A series of short, individual and group assignments are intended to engage students in relevant issues, encourage critical thinking, and build written and verbal presentation skills. A semester-long project will allow student groups to work on real-world pedestrian and bicycle projects in a community and directly apply their knowledge from class. Throughout the course, students will be exposed to current issues and various national and international perspectives through films and guest lectures from widely-recognized experts in the field. (4) Four hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisite: 213 or 217 or consent of instructor.Studio on applying skills of urban transportation planning. Topics vary, focusing on specific urban sites and multi-modal issues, including those related to planning for mass transit and other alternatives to the private automobile. Recent emphasis given to planning and designing for transit villages and transit-based housing.To come.(3) Three hours of lecture per week. Prerequisites 113A or equivalent.Analysis of the urban, metropolitan, and regional economy for planning. Economic base and other macro models; impact analysis and projection of changing labor force and industrial structure; economic-demographic interaction; issues in growth, income distribution, planning controls; interregional growth and population distribution issues.This course provides a rigorous foundation in theories of regional economic development, linked to various techniques of analysis and implementation, and in theories of metropolitan economic structure, focusing on patterns of inequality within regions.   A core economics class in City and Regional Planning, it helps planners in a variety of subfields—from transportation to urban design to community development—understand how the regional economy works.  It also serves as an essential basis for further work in the housing, community and economic development specialization.The regional economic development portion of the course will cover the classic single-region and multiple-region theories of development.  We start with the definition of region, a short intellectual history of regional planning, and the roles of industrial location and industrial structure in regional development.  We next turn to theories and evidence on uneven development and the interregional distribution of economic activity; the differential impact of international trade on regional development; the role of labor in development; debates about the organization of production and the nature of innovation; and the role of social capital in regions.The remainder of the course focuses on metropolitan structure, or intraregional theories.  We begin by examining the literature on metropolitan structure, in particular the relationship between economic/racial segregation and regional economic growth.  We next turn to the growing literature on the relationship between cities and suburbs and the debate over how economic growth and poverty are related.  Next, we look at the impact of urban decline on metropolitan regions, specifically the effects of suburban employment growth and urban decay.  The course concludes with a critical assessment of the new regionalism and the politics of metropolitan governance.This is a lecture/seminar class with heavy reading. All students will be expected to read the required reading ahead of time and join the class discussion.  Students are also required to complete a midterm and a final quiz, as well as a term paper or regional compendium.(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.Theory of housing markets and empirical methods for measuring market conditions and performance: housing consumption, housing supply and production, and market performance. Empirical analysis and applications to policy issues.This is a watershed moment in U.S. housing policy. After eight years of the Obama Administration, we are entering uncharted territory under a Trump Administration.  We have just emerged from the Great Recession, the largest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 19030s, and one that was caused by the collapse of the housing market. The implications of the crisis for housing policy are still unfolding. For the first time ever, there is a federal agency tasked with protecting consumer interests in the mortgage market (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) and yet its very existence is now in question.  The future of key housing institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA have been hotly debated by a Congress divided from the Administration.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has launched a number of new housing initiatives, including the Rental Assistance Demonstration and Choice Neighborhoods, but has been hamstrung by limited funding and uncertain political support.  HUD also produced a landmark fair housing rule (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing)- 50 years after the enactment of the Fair Housing Act.  The foreclosure crisis, which has finally abated in most parts of the country, has nevertheless disrupted the housing and financial stability of millions of American families, reinforcing and exacerbating patterns of discrimination and residential segregation. And at the local level, difficult tradeoffs emerge about where to invest scarce subsidies: should we build housing to support community development in low-income neighborhoods, or should affordable housing be directed to high opportunity neighborhoods that have historically been resistant to neighbors with less income and wealth? Further, many local communities like Oakland and San Francisco are faced with unprecedented increases rental prices. What strategies are available to these communities?How did we get here? What will the new Administration mean for advancing goals of housing stability and fairness? And what, in your view, should U.S. housing policy look like going forward? The goal of this class is to build a foundation of knowledge that will help students to think critically about these questions. Through readings, case studies, lectures and hands-on exercises, the class will explore a range of topics, including the history of U.S. housing policy, the structure of housing and related financial markets, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different tools available to intervene in these markets including subsidies (both direct and indirect) and regulation.The course will be oriented to contemporary issues in US housing policy and will pay particular attention to how housing is intertwined with issues of inequality and access to opportunity for lower-income and minority households. It will also provide context for the issues that city, regional and state level governments face in determining housing policies and programs. By the end of the class, students will understand the origins of contemporary debates in U.S. housing policy, gain familiarity with the programs, players, and best practices in the field, and develop their ability to evaluate the tradeoffs and challenges inherent in different policy approaches.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisites: 207 or equivalent. Description: Using case studies, this course acquaints students with the techniques of project feasibility; analysis of project proposals and overall project compatibility assessment. Case studies will be based on a variety of public and private sector developments, in central city and suburb locations.This course is designed to acquaint students with the economic, financial, market, and process fundamentals of all types pf urban development projects; including market-rate housing, retail, office, mixed-use development, and especially affordable housing. It is designed for students who want to work as or with private developers, non-profit housing and community developers, lenders, and downtown redevelopment authorities. CP235 is primarily a lecture course.Thematically, CP235 is divided into five parts:(4) Three hours of lecture/seminar and two hours of lab per week. Formerly Interdepartmental Studies 241.The components, structure, and meaning of the urban environment. Environmental problems, attitudes, and criteria. Environmental survey, analysis, and interview techniques. Methods of addressing environmental quality. Environmental simulation. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C241 section 1.The course focusses on research methods that designers and planning professionals use to analyze and evaluate urban places, be they buildings, urban districts, transportation routes, or landscapes. We are interested in gaining primary knowledge about places as opposed to relying solely on secondary sources; we test professional assumptions and biases. Research questions related to sustainable urban form, the relationship between density, housing types and livability are frequently at the core of current concerns. We test how far people walk and why; we are curious about the integration of natural processes in cities, to name a few recent topics. The selection of topics is driven by student interests. The methods used in the evaluations are the focus of the course and they include direct observation, field measurements, morphological-typological studies, surveys, focus groups and/or interviews.The urban environment will be viewed primarily as a social and psychological environment with the purpose to gain knowledge about a good fit between urban form and people’s values and expectations. Naturally, we are concerned about environments that function well in terms of use, balanced transportation modes, sound urban ecology, sense of place, equity, but also a sense of beauty that citizens expect from the environments they live and work in, or travel through. We are concerned with who environments are for, who uses them, and the conflicts that can arise between user groups.Environmental design and planning is inevitably a form of micro·politics. Evaluation will be seen as a basis for citizen involvement and environmental improvements rather than ends in themselves.(3) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: Previous design studio or consent of instrutor; City and Regional Planning C240/Landscape Architecture C250.This interdisciplinary studio focuses on the public realm of cities and explores opportunities for creating more humane and delightful public places. Problems will be at multiple scales in both existing urban centers and in areas of new growth. Skills in analyzing, designing, and communicating urban design problems will be developed. Studio work will be supplemented with lectures, discussions, and field trips. Visiting professionals will present case studies and will serve on reviews. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C203.To come.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture and three hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor.This is a hands-on course that trains students to analyze urban data, develop indicators, and create visualizations and maps using the Python programming language, open source tools, and public data. The course will first introduce the fundamentals of programming in Python before moving on to a survey of data analysis/visualization tools and technologies. Classroom sessions will include lectures and workshops. A series of exercises will reinforce the skills and topics being presented, and a final project will provide an opportunity for students to develop a more complete project from harvesting data from Open Data portals to synthesizing and analyzing those data to explore a question or problem, to communicating their results in a web map and blog, as well as a final presentation.This course is designed to provide future city planners with a toolkit of technical skills for quantitative problem solving. It requires some tolerance for experimentation, self-directed trial and error, and an interest in learning to write code. If you are willing to roll up your sleeves and embrace some uncertainty, you'll learn the fundamentals of urban data analysis and visualization, and might discover an entirely new lens through which to study, plan, and design neighborhoods, cities, and regions.Topics to be covered include:Prior coursework (such as CP 204C) and experience using a GIS is required. Students are not required to have prior programming experience, although it will be beneficial. Python is an accessible language and the course will emphasize learning by doing. Prior or concurrent course work in statistics and data analysis (e.g. CP 204A or 204D) is encouraged as this course will not provide the theoretical foundations of statistical analysis.This course is open to students from across campus, but priority enrollment will be given to students in the Master of City Planning program.(3) 3 hours of lecture per week. Also listed as PB HLTH C233.Exploration of common origins of urban planning and public health, from why and how the fields separated and strategies to reconnect them, to addressing urban health inequities in the 21st century. Inquiry to influences of urban population health, analysis of determinants, and roles that city planning and public health agencies - at local and international level - have in research, and action aimed at improving urban health. Measures, analysis, and design of policy strategies are explored.City life is the norm for an ever growing proportion of the world’s population. As urban populations increase, strains are placed on basic infrastructure, housing, ecologic resources, social relationships, the local and regional economy and governance practices. The urban environment influences many aspects of health and well-being: what people can eat, the air they breathe and the water they drink, where (or if) they work, the housing that shelters them, where they go for health care, the danger ( or safety) they encounter on the street, who is available for emotional and  inancial support, how political power is distributed and public resources allocated. How cities are managed, local policy, planning and design decisions can all help determine whether the places we live will be threats to the health of the public, protective against disease and premature death, and which populations will benefit or suffer the most.While the fields of modern city planning and public health emerged together in the 19th century to address urban inequities and infectious diseases, they were largely disconnected for much of the 20th century. In the 21st century, planning and public health are reconnecting to address the new health challenges of urbanization and globalization – from racial and ethnic disparities to land use sprawl to providing basic services to the millions of urban poor around the world living in informal slum settlements. How to reconnect the fields of planning and public health to address these and other 21st century urban health challenges is the focus of this course.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar per week.An examination of the roles of the citizens and citizen organizations in the city planning process. Models for citizen involvement ranging from advising to community control. Examination of the effectiveness of different organizational models in different situations. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C242.Involving people in planning and design decisions is an essential part of most planning and design projects in the United States. Good citizen engagement requires application of a specific set of methods and skills. It is a process of both giving information as well as collecting, analyzing and applying information. If done correctly the practitioner gains valuable information that will enhance the outcomes of a project in multiple ways politically, environmentally, socially, aesthetically and/or financially. If done poorly the result can have highly negative consequences. Involving people in a public planning context is different from involving people in site-specific design. The process in each case starts with different objectives and requires different methods. Results are applied in very distinct ways.This class will expose students to the range of both the theory and practice of engaging people in planning and design projects. Students will design and execute a community engagement project with a real organization, critique contemporary participatory planning in the United States and be trained to facilitate a public process.The class will meet once a week for three hours combining a series of lectures, discussions, guest speakers, public meetings, individual and team presentations and exercises. Lectures will draw on the readings, but will not duplicate them. Class time will allow for discussion, teamwork and student/instructor interaction.(2) Must be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Presentation and discussion of research by Ph.D. students and faculty.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture and discussion per week. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor.The investigation of modern cities has presented great challenges for social theory. For over a century, scholars have debated about how to read and explain the modern industrial city. This course traces the main ways in which these debates have unfolded since the middle of the nineteenth century to the present. To follow these debates is to understand how scholars have struggled to make cities legible, to fix them as objects of analysis, and simultaneously to capture their processes of transformation. Readings for the class include classical texts from Weber, Simmel, the Chicago School, the Marxist canon (from Engels to Lefebvre, Harvey and Castells), the LA School, the contemporary urbanists writing from the perspective of cities in the global south, and more.(1) 1.5 hours of lecture and discussion per week per module. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor.Analysis of selected topics in city and metropolitan planning with emphasis on implications for planning practice and urban policy formation. In some semesters, optional five-week, 1-unit modules may be offered, taking advantage of guest visitors.This workshop is designed for Masters students in the Department of City and Regional Planning who are working on their professional paper or thesis. It is a required core course for all MCP students who are graduating Dec 2017 or May 2018, or concurrent students who will leave the program this year. A waiver will be granted if the student has completed a rough draft of the PR/CR in the summer, is taking a thesis prep class in another department as part of a joint degree program, and/or the committee chair is ready to sign off.There will be three tracks: one for students who are just starting to select a topic; one for those who have a topic and will be graduating in May 2018; and a third track for those who are writing and/or intend to graduate or complete the PR by December 2017.Although there will be periodic lectures throughout the semester, the workshop is designed to be informal to meet the diversity of topics and approaches that characterize DCRP final papers and projects! There will be in-class writing and brainstorming exercises. Advising appointments are available for more individual attention.(3) 3 hours of lecture and discussion per week per module.

Prerequisites: Open to majors in all fields.Survey of city planning as it has evolved in the United States since 1800 in response to physical, social, and economic problems; major concepts and procedures used by city planners and local governments to improve the urban environment.Introduction to City Planning is an upper division course in the Department of City and Regional Planning providing students with a study of the origins, history, and legal basis for contemporary urban planning. The course explores several key areas of planning practice in the United States including urban design, housing, transportation, and community and economic development. The course also examines key challenges and opportunities in urban planning including sustainability, environmental justice, immigration, and community health. Throughout the semester the course also examines issues of justice, equity, and access as these relate to planning practice, planning theory, and the built environment. Given the often overlooked or neglected issues related to race, class, and gender, among others, the course aims to situate these in the study of planning histories, theories, and practices to help inform a new generation of planners, advocates, and informed global citizens. Students will gain a perspective to see how these issues form the complex fabric of cities, regions, and nations, which must be considered and incorporated into planning analysis and decision-making.Economic Analysis for Planning(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.Introduction to economic concepts and thinking as used in planning. Micro-economic theory is reviewed and critiqued.This is an introductory course in the application of basic principles of economic analysis to problems of urban planning and policy. The course aims to cover the fundamentals of microeconomic theory and apply them to contemporary planning issues, including urban land use, transportation, housing, education, and economic development planning.In this course we will explore: (1) how economic forces and policies shape the formation, location, size, form, function, growth and decline of cities; (2) how the basic tools of microeconomic analysis can be used to evaluate and address city planning issues; and (3) how to analyze critically the strengths and weaknesses of various economic approaches and arguments to justify specific urban policies.The class is not intended as a comprehensive introduction to the field of microeconomics; rather, it is designed to acquaint students with the essential elements of qualitative economics that are most relevant to the practice of city planning and the study of cities. Throughout the course, we will debate the suitability of economic theories for explaining urban phenomena and guiding policy. The study of theory will be augmented by examples and exercise in applying economic analysis to current planning problems in California.(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Open to majors in all fields.This course examines how the concept of sustainable development applies to cities and urban regions and gives students insight into a variety of contemporary urban planning issues through the sustainability lens. The course combines lectures, discussions, student projects, and guest appearances by leading practitioners in Bay Area sustainability efforts. Ways to coordinate goals of environment, economy, and equity at different scales of planning are addressed, including the region, the city, the neighborhood, and the site.Major 21st century challenges around the world are leading to a renewed focus on planning: rapid urbanization along with environmental degradation and habitat loss, climate change, overcrowding and inadequate access to quality housing, services and infrastructure, and resource shortages and price spikes in food and fuel, among other worries. All of these problems have substantial implications for the present and long-term form and functioning of metropolitan regions, cities and towns. Moreover, human land use patterns are altering global ecosystems. Because these are collective problems, they require state intervention to fundamentally change the nature of urban development; and this implies the need for planning. However, in the US and many places, planning practices and urban policies for much of the 20th century worsened equitable and environmental outcomes in the pursuit of economic growth.Worries about the environmental impacts of urban development were behind the revival of interest in planning in the 1990s, with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) introducing the concept of sustainable development into planning via Local Agenda 21 initiatives. Continued urban growth, accompanied by increasing urban poverty and the formation of slums (areas without adequate water, sanitation, housing and rights of tenure) have also refocused attention on planning. As countries rapidly urbanize, the issue of sustainable cities has become an urgent focus of decision makers at every level.New approaches to planning focused on achieving sustainability at various scales (e.g. the region, city, neighborhood) can help us reduce the pace and impact of human induced climate change. We can re-shape our cities from being sprawling and car-dependent to being compact, public transport-based, with priority for pedestrian movement by focusing on transportation access vs. mobility. We can increase the availability of housing that is both affordable and ‘green’. These steps and others would go a long way towards reducing fuel demand. At the same time, planning can also play a role in identifying and eliminating spaces of environmental injustice and limiting the use of hazardous areas through land-use zoning, tax incentives, environmental remediation and the relocation of residents from high-risk areas. The planning process itself can promote inclusiveness and equity through meaningful participation and equitable decision-making criteria such as the precautionary principle.The concept of and movement towards sustainability is creating a common language and set of practices (measures, methods, goals) between the planning profession and the broader world of environmental science and management, public health, public policy, and other related fields. Historically, modern city and town planning has been an interdisciplinary field (with roots in public health, architecture, landscape architecture, housing reform and applied social sciences). The previous incarnation of planners as top-down, expert-driven, technical blueprint creators of ‘master plans’ is evolving (in some places faster than others) to cope with complex, newer forms of urbanization. Cities that ‘get it’ realize that sustainability requires planning frameworks that are inclusive, participatory, adaptive, strategic, and action-oriented. Now that the profession has embraced sustainability, new ideas and transdisciplinary connections are allowing planning to evolve and integrate with other fields for better management of urban growth.This course examines how the concept of sustainability and sustainable development applies to cities and urban regions. Students will get insight into a variety of contemporary urban planning issues, including environmental justice, through the sustainability lens. The course combines lectures, discussions, student projects, and guest speakers. Ways to coordinate goals of environment, economy, and equity at different scales of planning are addressed, including the region, the city, the neighborhood, and the site.By the end of this course, you should be able to:(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation, transportation, pollution, energy services, and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints, weak institutions, and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover, democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic, but present challenges with respect to priority setting, coordination, and corruption.To come.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.The course is concerned with the multidisciplinary field and practice of urban design. It includes a review of historical approaches to urban design and current movements in the field, as well as discussion of the elements of urban form, theories of good city form, scales of urban design, implementation approaches, and challenges and opportunities for the discipline. Learning from cities via fieldwork is an integral part of the course.To come.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.This course focuses on sustainable mobility in world cities, with an emphasis on the long-term importance of how land development can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mobility options. Integration of sustainable mobility issues into daily discussions about cities is essential to improve decisions, increase funding opportunities, raise awareness, and foster environments that are more equitable, environmentally friendly, and economically sound.Sustainable transportation systems are influenced by factors at various levels: At the micro-scale, elements of the built environment, such as sidewalks, bicycle lanes, traffic speeds, and roadway crossings, impact how people travel. At the macro-scale, where activities are located, and the transportation connections among them, determine whether one can feasibly use transit, a shared vehicle, a bicycle, or walk to a destination.  As a result, addressing sustainable transportation issues requires the bridging of many disciplines, including urban planning/design, economics, engineering, and others.The course is divided into four sections: 1. An introduction, aimed at bridging the current course with knowledge gained in CP 114 and other courses; 2. Mass Transit; 3. Bicycling and Walking; and 4. Land development as a long-term strategic choice for the success of sustainable transportation modes.By the end of the course, students will be able to:(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.The history of city planning and the city planning profession in the context of urban history. Principal focus on the evolution of North American planning practice and theory since the late 19th century; some comparative and earlier material.This course provides a survey of key themes and moments in the emergence of city planning as a discipline as well as explains the larger history of urbanism and city planning across the globe. Although some emphasis will be given to U.S. and European discourses and case studies, the course will also highlight other global and transnational connections to the influence of planning ideas and practices in general. The course partially follows a chronology, but also interrupts this chronology to highlight certain trans-historical continuities.Learning Objectives(4) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.Part one of a two-semester course sequence that introduces first-year students in the Master of City Planning (MCP) program to a suite of data collection, data analysis, problem solving, and presentation methods that are essential for practicing planners. 201A focuses on supporting integrated problem solving, using a case-based approach to introduce methods in sequenced building-blocks. 201A is a prerequisite to 201B; exceptions made with instructor approval.CP201A is the first part of a two-semester course sequence, consisting of two courses totaling eight units, that introduces first-year students in the Master of City Planning (MCP) program to a suite of data collection, data analysis, problem solving, and presentation methods that are essential for practicing planners. The course focuses on supporting integrated problem solving, using a case-based approach to introduce methods in sequenced building-blocks.  The first course, CP 201A, provides an overview of methods in planning, focusing on the analysis and presentation of secondary data. CP 201A is generally a prerequisite to CP201B, which focuses on original data collection and more advanced statistical techniques. The course also prepares MCP students for more advanced courses in statistics, GIS, urban design, qualitative methods, survey methods, and public participation.Through lectures, case studies, and assignments, students will achieve the following learning objectives:(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisites: City Planning 113A or equivalent.Examination of the interactions between transportation and land use systems; historical perspectives on transportation; characteristics of travel and demand estimation; evaluation of system performance; location theory; models of transportation and urban structure; empirical evidence of transportation-land use impacts; case study examinations. Also listed as Civil and Environmental Engineering C290U.The United States continues to grow and urbanize, and people are traveling more than ever. Building roads and highways has become more difficult and less popular, and the funding for new roads and transit systems has become more constrained. Climate change, congestion, pollution, and accidents caused by motor vehicle use are becoming more politically salient. Some even argue there is a cultural shift afoot among young adults in which auto ownership is no longer de rigeur.Meanwhile, many state and local governments in the US have been pursuing policies such as transit-oriented development, smart growth programs, urban growth boundaries, and zoning code reform. These regulatory interventions don’t require public funds, and they are thought to decrease auto use and increase walking and transit use. Economists have long argued that such efforts are relatively inefficient solutions to congestion, pollution and sprawl, but better options like road pricing and spatially efficient development impact fees have been harder to implement. Property rights advocates, along with a large share of the general public, often express opposition to smart growth and related policies.This course focuses on providing an historical and theoretical understanding of interrelationships between urban form, land development, transportation investments, and household travel, with a focus on U.S. urban areas. Does a less sprawling city lead to more transit use? Will people walk to work three blocks away if they can easily drive? Does building roads have economic benefits? As it turns out, questions like these are not simple. We spend much of the time of the course learning what is well understood and what is controversial, and how debates over current plans in the Bay Area take into account or fail to take into account this knowledge. In the last two weeks of the course, we also learn about and practice some of the classic land use and transportation planning methods.Students in the course apply what they have learned to critically reading and evaluating empirical research and policy recommendations, as evaluated by answering weekly questions about the readings; participating in class discussions; presenting a planning document and leading a class discussion about it; writing a short paper; completing a problem set; and taking a final examination.By the end of this course, students will:(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisite: Graduate standing or consent of instructorCovers pedestrian and bicycle transportation planning including benefits of active transportation, importance of urban design and network connectivity, and facility design. Examines policies and programs to support active transportation and the processes to create, implement, and evaluate bicycle and pedestrian plans.Active transportation constitutes any human-powered means of getting around, primarily through walking and bicycling. Integration of pedestrian and bicycle concerns into transportation planning is essential for creating a sustainable urban system. Pedestrian and bicycle transportation are influenced by micro-scale elements of the built environment, such as sidewalks, bicycle lanes, traffic speeds, and roadway crossings, as well as by macro-scale characteristics, such as community-wide pathway systems and regional land use and street grid patterns.  As a result, addressing active transportation issues requires the bridging of many disciplines, including urban planning/design, civil engineering, and others. This course brings experiences from professionals in many fields (both public and private) and researchers at the local and national level into the classroom to provide diverse perspectives on effective pedestrian and bicycle planning strategies. This course is designed to critically discuss the key issues affecting active transportation practice today:A series of short, individual and group assignments are intended to engage students in relevant issues, encourage critical thinking, and build written and verbal presentation skills. A semester-long project will allow student groups to work on real-world pedestrian and bicycle projects in a community and directly apply their knowledge from class. Throughout the course, students will be exposed to current issues and various national and international perspectives through films and guest lectures from widely-recognized experts in the field. (4) Four hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisite: 213 or 217 or consent of instructor.Studio on applying skills of urban transportation planning. Topics vary, focusing on specific urban sites and multi-modal issues, including those related to planning for mass transit and other alternatives to the private automobile. Recent emphasis given to planning and designing for transit villages and transit-based housing.To come.(3) Three hours of lecture per week. Prerequisites 113A or equivalent.Analysis of the urban, metropolitan, and regional economy for planning. Economic base and other macro models; impact analysis and projection of changing labor force and industrial structure; economic-demographic interaction; issues in growth, income distribution, planning controls; interregional growth and population distribution issues.This course provides a rigorous foundation in theories of regional economic development, linked to various techniques of analysis and implementation, and in theories of metropolitan economic structure, focusing on patterns of inequality within regions.   A core economics class in City and Regional Planning, it helps planners in a variety of subfields—from transportation to urban design to community development—understand how the regional economy works.  It also serves as an essential basis for further work in the housing, community and economic development specialization.The regional economic development portion of the course will cover the classic single-region and multiple-region theories of development.  We start with the definition of region, a short intellectual history of regional planning, and the roles of industrial location and industrial structure in regional development.  We next turn to theories and evidence on uneven development and the interregional distribution of economic activity; the differential impact of international trade on regional development; the role of labor in development; debates about the organization of production and the nature of innovation; and the role of social capital in regions.The remainder of the course focuses on metropolitan structure, or intraregional theories.  We begin by examining the literature on metropolitan structure, in particular the relationship between economic/racial segregation and regional economic growth.  We next turn to the growing literature on the relationship between cities and suburbs and the debate over how economic growth and poverty are related.  Next, we look at the impact of urban decline on metropolitan regions, specifically the effects of suburban employment growth and urban decay.  The course concludes with a critical assessment of the new regionalism and the politics of metropolitan governance.This is a lecture/seminar class with heavy reading. All students will be expected to read the required reading ahead of time and join the class discussion.  Students are also required to complete a midterm and a final quiz, as well as a term paper or regional compendium.(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.Theory of housing markets and empirical methods for measuring market conditions and performance: housing consumption, housing supply and production, and market performance. Empirical analysis and applications to policy issues.This is a watershed moment in U.S. housing policy. After eight years of the Obama Administration, we are entering uncharted territory under a Trump Administration.  We have just emerged from the Great Recession, the largest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 19030s, and one that was caused by the collapse of the housing market. The implications of the crisis for housing policy are still unfolding. For the first time ever, there is a federal agency tasked with protecting consumer interests in the mortgage market (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) and yet its very existence is now in question.  The future of key housing institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA have been hotly debated by a Congress divided from the Administration.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has launched a number of new housing initiatives, including the Rental Assistance Demonstration and Choice Neighborhoods, but has been hamstrung by limited funding and uncertain political support.  HUD also produced a landmark fair housing rule (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing)- 50 years after the enactment of the Fair Housing Act.  The foreclosure crisis, which has finally abated in most parts of the country, has nevertheless disrupted the housing and financial stability of millions of American families, reinforcing and exacerbating patterns of discrimination and residential segregation. And at the local level, difficult tradeoffs emerge about where to invest scarce subsidies: should we build housing to support community development in low-income neighborhoods, or should affordable housing be directed to high opportunity neighborhoods that have historically been resistant to neighbors with less income and wealth? Further, many local communities like Oakland and San Francisco are faced with unprecedented increases rental prices. What strategies are available to these communities?How did we get here? What will the new Administration mean for advancing goals of housing stability and fairness? And what, in your view, should U.S. housing policy look like going forward? The goal of this class is to build a foundation of knowledge that will help students to think critically about these questions. Through readings, case studies, lectures and hands-on exercises, the class will explore a range of topics, including the history of U.S. housing policy, the structure of housing and related financial markets, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different tools available to intervene in these markets including subsidies (both direct and indirect) and regulation.The course will be oriented to contemporary issues in US housing policy and will pay particular attention to how housing is intertwined with issues of inequality and access to opportunity for lower-income and minority households. It will also provide context for the issues that city, regional and state level governments face in determining housing policies and programs. By the end of the class, students will understand the origins of contemporary debates in U.S. housing policy, gain familiarity with the programs, players, and best practices in the field, and develop their ability to evaluate the tradeoffs and challenges inherent in different policy approaches.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisites: 207 or equivalent. Description: Using case studies, this course acquaints students with the techniques of project feasibility; analysis of project proposals and overall project compatibility assessment. Case studies will be based on a variety of public and private sector developments, in central city and suburb locations.This course is designed to acquaint students with the economic, financial, market, and process fundamentals of all types pf urban development projects; including market-rate housing, retail, office, mixed-use development, and especially affordable housing. It is designed for students who want to work as or with private developers, non-profit housing and community developers, lenders, and downtown redevelopment authorities. CP235 is primarily a lecture course.Thematically, CP235 is divided into five parts:(4) Three hours of lecture/seminar and two hours of lab per week. Formerly Interdepartmental Studies 241.The components, structure, and meaning of the urban environment. Environmental problems, attitudes, and criteria. Environmental survey, analysis, and interview techniques. Methods of addressing environmental quality. Environmental simulation. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C241 section 1.The course focusses on research methods that designers and planning professionals use to analyze and evaluate urban places, be they buildings, urban districts, transportation routes, or landscapes. We are interested in gaining primary knowledge about places as opposed to relying solely on secondary sources; we test professional assumptions and biases. Research questions related to sustainable urban form, the relationship between density, housing types and livability are frequently at the core of current concerns. We test how far people walk and why; we are curious about the integration of natural processes in cities, to name a few recent topics. The selection of topics is driven by student interests. The methods used in the evaluations are the focus of the course and they include direct observation, field measurements, morphological-typological studies, surveys, focus groups and/or interviews.The urban environment will be viewed primarily as a social and psychological environment with the purpose to gain knowledge about a good fit between urban form and people’s values and expectations. Naturally, we are concerned about environments that function well in terms of use, balanced transportation modes, sound urban ecology, sense of place, equity, but also a sense of beauty that citizens expect from the environments they live and work in, or travel through. We are concerned with who environments are for, who uses them, and the conflicts that can arise between user groups.Environmental design and planning is inevitably a form of micro·politics. Evaluation will be seen as a basis for citizen involvement and environmental improvements rather than ends in themselves.(3) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: Previous design studio or consent of instrutor; City and Regional Planning C240/Landscape Architecture C250.This interdisciplinary studio focuses on the public realm of cities and explores opportunities for creating more humane and delightful public places. Problems will be at multiple scales in both existing urban centers and in areas of new growth. Skills in analyzing, designing, and communicating urban design problems will be developed. Studio work will be supplemented with lectures, discussions, and field trips. Visiting professionals will present case studies and will serve on reviews. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C203.To come.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture and three hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor.This is a hands-on course that trains students to analyze urban data, develop indicators, and create visualizations and maps using the Python programming language, open source tools, and public data. The course will first introduce the fundamentals of programming in Python before moving on to a survey of data analysis/visualization tools and technologies. Classroom sessions will include lectures and workshops. A series of exercises will reinforce the skills and topics being presented, and a final project will provide an opportunity for students to develop a more complete project from harvesting data from Open Data portals to synthesizing and analyzing those data to explore a question or problem, to communicating their results in a web map and blog, as well as a final presentation.This course is designed to provide future city planners with a toolkit of technical skills for quantitative problem solving. It requires some tolerance for experimentation, self-directed trial and error, and an interest in learning to write code. If you are willing to roll up your sleeves and embrace some uncertainty, you'll learn the fundamentals of urban data analysis and visualization, and might discover an entirely new lens through which to study, plan, and design neighborhoods, cities, and regions.Topics to be covered include:Prior coursework (such as CP 204C) and experience using a GIS is required. Students are not required to have prior programming experience, although it will be beneficial. Python is an accessible language and the course will emphasize learning by doing. Prior or concurrent course work in statistics and data analysis (e.g. CP 204A or 204D) is encouraged as this course will not provide the theoretical foundations of statistical analysis.This course is open to students from across campus, but priority enrollment will be given to students in the Master of City Planning program.(3) 3 hours of lecture per week. Also listed as PB HLTH C233.Exploration of common origins of urban planning and public health, from why and how the fields separated and strategies to reconnect them, to addressing urban health inequities in the 21st century. Inquiry to influences of urban population health, analysis of determinants, and roles that city planning and public health agencies - at local and international level - have in research, and action aimed at improving urban health. Measures, analysis, and design of policy strategies are explored.City life is the norm for an ever growing proportion of the world’s population. As urban populations increase, strains are placed on basic infrastructure, housing, ecologic resources, social relationships, the local and regional economy and governance practices. The urban environment influences many aspects of health and well-being: what people can eat, the air they breathe and the water they drink, where (or if) they work, the housing that shelters them, where they go for health care, the danger ( or safety) they encounter on the street, who is available for emotional and  inancial support, how political power is distributed and public resources allocated. How cities are managed, local policy, planning and design decisions can all help determine whether the places we live will be threats to the health of the public, protective against disease and premature death, and which populations will benefit or suffer the most.While the fields of modern city planning and public health emerged together in the 19th century to address urban inequities and infectious diseases, they were largely disconnected for much of the 20th century. In the 21st century, planning and public health are reconnecting to address the new health challenges of urbanization and globalization – from racial and ethnic disparities to land use sprawl to providing basic services to the millions of urban poor around the world living in informal slum settlements. How to reconnect the fields of planning and public health to address these and other 21st century urban health challenges is the focus of this course.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar per week.An examination of the roles of the citizens and citizen organizations in the city planning process. Models for citizen involvement ranging from advising to community control. Examination of the effectiveness of different organizational models in different situations. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C242.Involving people in planning and design decisions is an essential part of most planning and design projects in the United States. Good citizen engagement requires application of a specific set of methods and skills. It is a process of both giving information as well as collecting, analyzing and applying information. If done correctly the practitioner gains valuable information that will enhance the outcomes of a project in multiple ways politically, environmentally, socially, aesthetically and/or financially. If done poorly the result can have highly negative consequences. Involving people in a public planning context is different from involving people in site-specific design. The process in each case starts with different objectives and requires different methods. Results are applied in very distinct ways.This class will expose students to the range of both the theory and practice of engaging people in planning and design projects. Students will design and execute a community engagement project with a real organization, critique contemporary participatory planning in the United States and be trained to facilitate a public process.The class will meet once a week for three hours combining a series of lectures, discussions, guest speakers, public meetings, individual and team presentations and exercises. Lectures will draw on the readings, but will not duplicate them. Class time will allow for discussion, teamwork and student/instructor interaction.(2) Must be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Presentation and discussion of research by Ph.D. students and faculty.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture and discussion per week. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor.The investigation of modern cities has presented great challenges for social theory. For over a century, scholars have debated about how to read and explain the modern industrial city. This course traces the main ways in which these debates have unfolded since the middle of the nineteenth century to the present. To follow these debates is to understand how scholars have struggled to make cities legible, to fix them as objects of analysis, and simultaneously to capture their processes of transformation. Readings for the class include classical texts from Weber, Simmel, the Chicago School, the Marxist canon (from Engels to Lefebvre, Harvey and Castells), the LA School, the contemporary urbanists writing from the perspective of cities in the global south, and more.(1) 1.5 hours of lecture and discussion per week per module. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor.Analysis of selected topics in city and metropolitan planning with emphasis on implications for planning practice and urban policy formation. In some semesters, optional five-week, 1-unit modules may be offered, taking advantage of guest visitors.This workshop is designed for Masters students in the Department of City and Regional Planning who are working on their professional paper or thesis. It is a required core course for all MCP students who are graduating Dec 2017 or May 2018, or concurrent students who will leave the program this year. A waiver will be granted if the student has completed a rough draft of the PR/CR in the summer, is taking a thesis prep class in another department as part of a joint degree program, and/or the committee chair is ready to sign off.There will be three tracks: one for students who are just starting to select a topic; one for those who have a topic and will be graduating in May 2018; and a third track for those who are writing and/or intend to graduate or complete the PR by December 2017.Although there will be periodic lectures throughout the semester, the workshop is designed to be informal to meet the diversity of topics and approaches that characterize DCRP final papers and projects!

Recognizing that defining this context relies on critical thinking with regard to economic, social, and environmental outcomes, this course explores what, precisely, stakeholders value in conceptualizing “smart” urbanity. Fundamentally we will place the smart cities construct at the intersection of data and governance. Accordingly, this course will teach students systematic approaches to collecting, analyzing, modeling, and interpreting quantitative data used to inform robust research, and, ultimately, urban planning practice and policymaking. Beyond instruction in urban data science and analytics, students will be introduced to theory and critical discourses on topics such as big data, open data and e-governance. Instructors will expect students to engage with technical and theoretical - with particular focus placed on ethical - considerations associated with these subjects in lecture and laboratory sections.The course will be structured following 3 modules:(3) Three hours of lecture per week.Introduction to political, economic and social issues involved in theory and practice of community economic development. Focus on national economic and social policies, role of local community economic development corporations (CDCs), resolution of conflicts between private-sector profitability and public sector (community) accountability through critical use of the planning process.To come(3) Three hours of lecture per week.This course is designed to introduce students to the characteristics of urban transportation systems, the methods through which they are planned and analyzed, and the dimensions of key policy issues confronting decision makers.To come.(4) Four hours of lecture/discussion per week plus fieldwork. Prerequisites: Upper division standing; 110 or consent of instructor.An intermediate course in the planning process with practicum in using planning techniques. Classes typically work on developing an area or other community plan. Some lectures, extensive field and group work, oral and written presentations of findings.City Planning 116 is an intensive studio course that seeks to give students a real- world experience with city planning. By focusing on one physical area, the course helps students learn about the entire gamut of city planning issues: physical building and street design issues, social and economic issues, environmental impacts, analysis methods, legal framework, city government, politics, and community dynamics. During the course, students work in the field and in the studio, undertaking a series of assignments that culminate in the preparation of a plan for the study area.City Planning 116 is targeted to undergraduate City Planning majors and Urban Studies majors who have already taken CP 110, but is open to other undergraduate and graduate students as space permits. As a studio, it is a class of 20-30 students that allows for intensive interaction with classmates and the instructor. Different components of the work will be done individually, in small groups, and as an entire class.(4) Three hours of lecture/seminar and one hour discussion per week.This course looks at the idea and practice of community in cities and suburbs and at the dynamics of neighborhood and community formation. Topics include urban social geography, ethnicity, and identity, residential choice behavior, the political economy of neighborhoods, planning for neighborhoods and civic engagement.This course will explore the urban theories, policies, and politics that have shaped contemporary urban communities within the United States. It will examine the macro-level structural factors that have shaped the economic, political, and social environments of urban communities. More importantly, this course will provide an understanding of how these factors have shaped the lives, culture, opportunities, and values of various ethnic and racial groups residing in urban America. The course will also examine how the physical and spatial landscape of urban communities impacts urban residents’ access to resources and opportunities.In the first part of the course we will take a historical and theoretical look at what an urban community is, how it is formed, and it has evolved over time. We will discuss the major urban theories related to metropolitan development and migration patterns of ethnic and racial groups. Specifically we will discuss the rise of suburbanization (especially after World War II), examine economic and political forces, and analyze the impact of segregation and urban policies on communities of color with respect to education, economic opportunities, housing, health status, etc.We will also examine contemporary metropolitan America through an analysis of case studies of urban communities across the country. We will discuss the myriad of challenges and opportunities facing urban residents. We will analyze readings that discuss important topics such as immigration, gentrification, planning and zoning, housing development, health disparities, race and ethnicity, and local policies and politics. Where possible we will also discuss the role of institutions and organizations in the community development process.Finally we will discuss the future of urban life in the U.S. We will discuss issues related to regionalism, globalization, demographic change, and urban sustainability. We will attempt to understand how these factors may impact the future development patterns and way of life of urban populations.(3) Three hours of lecture per week.This course reviews what society and local communities can do in terms of policies, programs, and local planning to address the needs of citizens with disabilities. Attention will be given to the economics of disability, to the politics of producing change, and to transportation, housing, public facilities, independent living, employment, and income policies. Options will be assessed from the varying perspectives of those with disabilities and the broader society.The World Report on Disability (2011) states that more than one billion people in the world today experience disability.  They have poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities.  In the United States, approximately 52 million Americans may experience difficulty seeing, walking, hearing, remembering or moving around without assistance.  As populations of Western societies age, this proportion is likely to increase; all of us at some point in our lives are likely to become disabled.This course provides students with an introduction to inclusive environmental design, using real-world case studies to offer tangible design and policy solutions that eliminate barriers and improve outcomes for all people. We will explore the viewpoints of persons with disabilities, urban studies and disability studies scholars, advocates, policy makers, and leaders from the private sector in developing inclusive cities through planning, architecture and design.The notion of ‘disability’ is complex, dynamic, multidimensional, and contested. Various terminologies used in the field are subject to intense criticism, and activists, researchers and policymakers have a wide variety of responses to the goal of equalizing opportunities for individuals with disabilities. While we refer to some of these critical perspectives in the class, our discussions will not engage them directly. CP 120 is directed more toward understanding problems and devising solutions, revealing that what appears to be an insurmountable, amorphous ‘problem’ is in fact susceptible to systematic resolutions. Dr. Victor Pineda is an urban planner and a globally recognized scholar on disability inclusive policy, planning and development. Dr. Pineda’s work focuses on urban resilience, inclusion and sustainability. He holds a PhD in Urban Planning from UCLA.(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week per unit. Prerequisites: Upper division standing.A capstone course for urban studies majors; open to other majors by instructor approval. Topical focus varies by semester. The course involves student production of a high-quality research report from inception to completion. Lectures introduce a range of research skills typical in urban studies, and cover specific domain knowledge necessary for the completion of the research project. Students identify a research topic subject to instructor approval and prepare a formal research proposal, undertaking the analysis specified in the proposal, making public presentations of their findings, and producing a professional-quality research report.The course will focus on key headline issues including development without displacement, affordable housing, Constitutional policing, and more.  The course will examine the public interest questions: who do city governments and policies serve (both explicitly and implicitly) and how to more effectively involve and serve the disparate publics and interests not well served by government or the private sector.Using Oakland, and other East Bay communities, as case studies, the course will integrate direct front-line experience with broader conceptual analyses. Students will work on projects of current importance and gain a detailed familiarity with a wide-range of issues, policies, programs, and documents.The class will include presentations by various city “actors”: senior staff, elected officials, private sector leaders, and community activists.  A major course objective is for students to get exposure to, and do meaningful research on urgent topics in the pursuit of more equitable policies and actions.The course emphasizes ‘experiential learning’ or 'research-by-doing’ or “ participatory research"– particularly working closely with policy makers and coalitions of affected or impacted communities.Students will produce a professional-quality research report as well as make public presentations of findings.The course is taught by a former City Administrator (city manager) of Oakland.(3) One hour of lecture/discussion per week per unit.

The Y-PLAN is a powerful planning methodology being adapted by leading educators and civic leaders in cities and regions across the nation and globe.  Y-PLAN infuses social justice and healthy community lenses into the planning and civic engagement process by centering young people and their ideas. Y-PLAN engages young people in the question of why plan? Why plan for my community and myself?  After an initial teaching preparation phase, UCB students work side-by-side with high school students for ten weeks, teaching them fundamentals of community development by engaging in real-world, healthy city planning projects.This year, the undergraduate UC Berkeley students will be working with two high schools in Oakland and the planners from the City of Oakland on the Downtown Oakland Specific Plan. This is an exciting opportunity for students to think broadly about how downtowns can be equitable, sustainable spaces for people of all ages. The course consists of social justice and critical pedagogy readings, discussion, fieldwork and preparing for the final presentation in April.(3) One hour of lecture/discussion per week per unit.

Students will read about, visit, and then write about a range of urban places in the Bay Area, including homes, neighborhoods, and forms of urban transportation. We will workshop students’ essays, reviews, and other short forms, as they write about their own and others’ experiences of the city and its buildings.  Readings will include notable examples of urban interpretation, by authors such as Rebecca Solnit, Mike Davis, D.J. Waldie, J.B. Jackson, and Joan Didion as well as by the instructors Margaret Crawford and Alec Stewart.(4) Three hours of lecture per week. Prerequisites: City and Regional Planning 201A; exceptions made with instructor approval.Second course in two-semester course sequence that introduces first-year students in the Master of City Planning (MCP) program to a suite of data collection, data analysis, problem solving, and presentation methods that are essential for practicing planners. 201B prepares MCP students for more advanced courses in statistics, GIS, observation, qualitative methods, survey methods, and public participation.CP 201B is the second part of a two-semester course sequence that introduces first-year students in the Master of City Planning (MCP) program to a suite of data collection, data analysis, problem solving, and presentation methods that are essential for practicing planners. The course focuses on supporting integrated problem solving, using a case-based approach to introduce methods in sequenced building-blocks. The course also prepares MCP students for more advanced courses in statistics, GIS, observation, qualitative methods, survey methods, and public participation.The second semester of the course, CP 201B, continues the overview of methods in planning that began in CP 201A. We focus on qualitative methods and data collection (observation, focus groups, interviews, and surveys), additional GIS tools for creating spatial measures, and methods of statistical inference including regression. CP 201A is generally a prerequisite to CP 201B, with exceptions made by instructor approval.The two-semester course is designed to introduce students to problem identification in the planning realm, and to the data collection and analysis skills relevant to addressing those problems. Students will:(4) Four hours of lecture/laboratory per week.Introduction to the principles and practical uses of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This course is intended for graduate students with exposure to using spreadsheets and database programs for urban and natural resource analysis, and who wish to expand their knowledge to include basic GIS concepts and applications. Prior GIS or desktop mapping experience not required.This course is designed for graduate students in City and Regional Planning or related disciplines. CP204c covers a range of GIS techniques used in planning. It focuses on the development of spatial models, beginning with simple vector based objects representing a sampled real world, through raster based cellular networks (often from remotely sensed imagery), to constrained vector line networks (solving location allocation problems), to more complex (and realistic) 3D surfaces. It reviews the impact that proximity and boundaries exert on spatial interaction and introduces concepts and models to solve spatial problems in both (urban) constrained and (landscape) unconstrained environments. This course emphasizes the interplay of theory and application, with a dozen computer based homework assignments (all involving analyses using ArcGIS 10.x). Theory is introduced through lectures and assigned readings, while application is emphasized during in class exercises, homework assignments, and a final project. The primary goal of this course is to provide students with the spatial theory, knowledge and applied skills to define, design and develop their own models to solve spatial problems in city and regional planning. The student will develop skills in spatial analysis that include: data discovery (Web based), database design and construction, spatial data integration, data rectification and projection, image processing and integration (at a basic level), spatial data model conversion, data management, modeling and data presentation (commonly referred to as mapping).(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture/discussion per week. Prerequisites: 113A or equivalent.Using microeconomics as its platform, course explores the process and pattern of land utilization from a variety of perspectives: the neighborhood, the city, and the metropolis. The approach blends real estate, descriptive urban geography, and urban history with economics.To come.(5) Course Format: Three hours of seminar and five hours of studio per week.An introductory laboratory experience in urban plan preparation, including the use of graphic communication techniques appropriate to city planning and invoking individual effort and that of collaborative student groups in formulating planning policies and programs for an urban area. Occasional Friday meetings are required.This studio course explores city building and place-making from a planning perspective within the context of preparing a neighborhood plan for a real urban neighborhood.The first half of the studio will be spent learning about the study area’s existing physical environment, natural and man-made, and the social and economic contexts in which it is situated. Working individually and in teams, students will engage in empirical observations and other forms of data collection, including meetings with local community members and service providers. Following analysis of the gathered data, students will prepare graphics that communicate the findings, identify the opportunities and constraints that derive from them, and speak to implications. Students will orally present their findings to a group of planning professionals, community members, activists, and faculty.The second half of the studio will be spent preparing a neighborhood plan for the study area. The plan will deal primarily with physical issues including land use and urban form, housing, streets and open spaces, and transportation, but there will be an opportunity to also address economic development and community development issues through their relation to physical elements and structures. Students will work in teams, but will be responsible for individual work within the context of the team’s overall plan. This individual work will consist of either planning and design proposals for specific development sites and public spaces that have been identified as central to the plan, or socio-economic proposals that are associated with specific physical sites. The plan will be prepared in graphic form and students will present it orally at a final review.A major emphasis of the course is on the graphic communication of planning and design analysis and proposals, and on oral presentations. Time will be devoted to learning drawing and sketching techniques appropriate for plan preparation and the use of computer applications for presentation graphics. The class will meet on Mondays, Wednesdays and some Fridays, per the course schedule. Please note that the two of the five computer graphics workshop sessions will take place on Saturday mornings rather than during the regularly scheduled class time.Study Area this Semester:  Downtown Oakland Freeway Corridors (possible re-design of 980 into a surface boulevard; re-design of 880 underpasses at Webster and Broadway; possible design for a homeless facility on vacated street right-of-way under 580).The main learning objectives of this course are:Along the way, students will learn a number of things, including: the relationship between the design of a specific built environment and its functional, aesthetic and social attributes; knowledge of best practice planning approaches, regulations, incentives, and graphic technologies; knowledge about alternative plan implementation strategies; the skills needed to practice neighborhood planning in ways consistent with the ethical norms for planning; problem solving skills required to diagnose and solve complex planning problems; ways to approach balancing the needs and interests of diverse stakeholders; how to thoughtfully question prevalent planning and design standards and norms that may lead to undesirable outcomes; methods for collaborating with professional peers in joint plan-making processes; and how to discriminate among competing community stakeholder and professional goals related to various values including justice, equity, fairness, efficiency, order, and beauty.(3) Three hours of lecture/discussion per week.

Empirical analysis and applications to policy issues.This is a watershed moment in U.S. housing policy. After eight years of the Obama Administration, we are entering uncharted territory under a Trump Administration.  We have just emerged from the Great Recession, the largest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 19030s, and one that was caused by the collapse of the housing market. The implications of the crisis for housing policy are still unfolding. For the first time ever, there is a federal agency tasked with protecting consumer interests in the mortgage market (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) and yet its very existence is now in question.  The future of key housing institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA have been hotly debated by a Congress divided from the Administration.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has launched a number of new housing initiatives, including the Rental Assistance Demonstration and Choice Neighborhoods, but has been hamstrung by limited funding and uncertain political support.  HUD also produced a landmark fair housing rule (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing)- 50 years after the enactment of the Fair Housing Act.  The foreclosure crisis, which has finally abated in most parts of the country, has nevertheless disrupted the housing and financial stability of millions of American families, reinforcing and exacerbating patterns of discrimination and residential segregation. And at the local level, difficult tradeoffs emerge about where to invest scarce subsidies: should we build housing to support community development in low-income neighborhoods, or should affordable housing be directed to high opportunity neighborhoods that have historically been resistant to neighbors with less income and wealth? Further, many local communities like Oakland and San Francisco are faced with unprecedented increases rental prices. What strategies are available to these communities?How did we get here? What will the new Administration mean for advancing goals of housing stability and fairness? And what, in your view, should U.S. housing policy look like going forward? The goal of this class is to build a foundation of knowledge that will help students to think critically about these questions. Through readings, case studies, lectures and hands-on exercises, the class will explore a range of topics, including the history of U.S. housing policy, the structure of housing and related financial markets, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different tools available to intervene in these markets including subsidies (both direct and indirect) and regulation.The course will be oriented to contemporary issues in US housing policy and will pay particular attention to how housing is intertwined with issues of inequality and access to opportunity for lower-income and minority households. It will also provide context for the issues that city, regional and state level governments face in determining housing policies and programs. By the end of the class, students will understand the origins of contemporary debates in U.S. housing policy, gain familiarity with the programs, players, and best practices in the field, and develop their ability to evaluate the tradeoffs and challenges inherent in different policy approaches.(3) Three hours of lecture per week. Prerequisites: Consent of instructor. Also listed as Landscape Architecture C250.Theories and patterns of urban form throughout history are studied with emphasis on the role of planning and design in shaping cities and the relationship between urban form and social, economic, and geographic factors. Using a case study approach, cities are evaluated in terms of various theories and performance dimensions.What is a good city? How does it come to be? How have conceptions of good city form changed over time? How and why over time have cities taken the form they have? Theories and patterns of urban form throughout history are studied comparatively with emphasis on the relations between urban form and social, economic, and geographic factors. The role of planning and design in shaping urban form is addressed. Cities are evaluated in terms of various theories and performance dimensions. Students have the option of doing a term paper, a morphological analysis of a city, or a final examination for their major work in the course.(5) Three hours of seminar and five hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 208 or 240.Advanced problems in urban design and land use, and in environmental planning. Occasional Friday meetings are required.The CP 248 studio will focus on urban design and city planning related to large scale infrastructure projects and on sustainable design in an era of climate change and population growth.We will explore the comparisons between sites in London, where large scale infrastructure projects such as Crossrail and High Speed 2 are under way, and the Bay Area, where plans for a new Transbay BART / Amtrak crossing are in their early stages.Both metropolitan regions are undergoing rapid growth in population and facing the urgent need for affordable housing. New sustainable urban frameworks are needed to accommodate growth and provide alternatives to sprawl. Greater London is expected to grow from 8.5 million to over 10 million by mid-century. The Bay Area is expected to undergo a similar population increase, the equivalent of accommodating the combined populations of San Jose and Oakland. Both city regions are experiencing severe shortages of affordable housing and the social equity pressures of dislocation through gentrification of former working class neighborhoods.The class will start with explorations of relevant case studies of sustainable urbanism and the lessons that can be learnt from them. These could include regeneration of former brownfield sites such as King’s Cross Lands and the Olympic Park Legacy sites in London; examples of green urbanism such as Hammarby Sjostad in Stockholm and Bo01 in Malmo, Sweden; the residential block patterns in new communities such as Ijberg and the Eastern Harbour developments in Amsterdam; unbuilt proposals such as those for Parc de la Villette in Paris. Case studies will be analysed for their urban form, block patterns, transit networks, housing typologies and sustainable urban infrastructure.London’s Crossrail and the Second BART Transbay CrossingWe will explore the city planning proposals related to London’s Crossrail and the Bay Area’s future Second Transbay Crossing. Crossrail is currently the largest infrastructure project in Europe, a new 75 mile long east / west rail line across London including 13 miles of new tunnelling. It will not only connect Heathrow Airport with places like the City of London and Canary Wharf but also serve some of the most deprived parts of London creating opportunities for new housing and employment.High Speed 2 will provide relief for the crowded West Coast Main line and bring cities like Birmingham and Manchester into commuting timeframes with London.When BART was planned in the 1970’s it was designed to accommodate 250,000 passengers a day. It is now carrying over 400,000 but will not be able to carry the projected 600,000 by mid-century. This is why a second Transbay crossing is now being studied. The route for the new line is projected to connect the booming employment district of San Francisco’s South of Market District and the East Bay cities of Alameda and Oakland. The double decked tunnel is planned to also link the Amtrak Capitol Corridor in the East Bay and the Caltrain corridor down the Peninsula as well as the California High Speed Rail line from Los Angeles.Development sites: Old Oak Common, London / OaklandThe studio will develop urban design plans for two sites. One is for Old Oak Common in West London. This is a brownfield site crisscrossed by railway lines and the location for a major transit hub with a new station for both Crossrail and the future High Speed 2 rail line serving London and the North. Old Oak Common is a real project currently being proposed by the Greater London Authority (GLA) with a detailed programme to build over 10,000 new housing units and employment for 5m sq ft.Downtown Oakland could be a site for similar growth particularly if the I-980 freeway corridor is used as the path for the new Transbay line. The 250 acre site could connect Downtown Oakland with the currently isolated West Oakland and repair damage done by the now discredited 1960 era policies of urban renewal and urban freeways.Students will be able to work in teams playing to the strengths of their different disciplines and produce planning and urban design proposals for the two sites. Studies will include urban structures, street and block patterns, land use and building typologies, open space and park designs as well as proposals for sustainable design.Cambridge Urban Design WorkshopThrough the Global University Alliance between UC Berkeley, Cambridge University and the National University of Singapore an urban design workshop in Cambridge is being planned for the Spring Break March 25 - April 4 2017 to which students are encouraged to attend. Funding for travel and accommodation will be available. However attendance is voluntary and is not a part of the course requirement.(3) 3 hours of lecture per week.This course will explore the theory, history, methods, and practice of local community development.

This course is designed as an interdisciplinary approach for business, law, planning, and public policy students to learn about every aspect of deal making in the land development process. Although the course will focus on real estate and land investment, the thrust will be on deal making, whether it be on acquisition, financing, environmental review, entitlement, obtaining community support, or ultimate disposition of a successful project. Law students will learn to evaluate business risks and to make deals, and business, planning, and public policy students will gain a conceptual framework for understanding legal issues which are critical to the real estate development and deal making process. The course will also introduce the use of green technology and the inclusion of affordable housing in the development process. Mr. Falik encourages significant interaction among the business, law, planning, and public policy students in responding to real life land development issues. Students will be responsible for participating in interdisciplinary study groups to work together to resolve real-life real estate problems.Topics which will be covered include:There will be frequent guest lecturers who are some of the leading experts in the deal-making, planning, environmental, and investment fields.(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture and discussion per week per module.

These problems often manifest themselves in people’s daily lives in physical patterns like segregated neighborhoods or decaying infrastructure.But they are also failures of democratic decision-making, because they reflect our inability to act collectively to change the direction of our society.  In order to make progress—to begin to solve the problems that really matter—it is not enough to propose planning solutions. We also need to be capable of getting those solutions adopted through the political and governance system that we live under—or, perhaps even more ambitiously, to change our systems of politics and governance.This class will look at the intersection of regional planning and democratic theory to explore the way we make collective decisions about regional planning problems. Readings will draw from both planning and political theory, exploring the major debates about how we should solve problems in a democratic society. The semester is structured into three overlapping themes:The class will be conducted as a seminar, with one 3-hour meeting per week. It will rely on a combination of lectures by the instructor, guest lectures from practitioners in the field, and case studies that look at specific attempts to overcome regional planning problems. Students will be evaluated based on three pieces of work:The instructor, Gabriel Metcalf, is the Cornish Endowed Chair for Regional Planning and the Executive Director of SPUR (SF Bay Area Planning and Urban Research).(3) Course Format: Three hours of lecture and discussion per week per module.

This cross-listed graduate seminar draws from different methods across the humanities and environmental design to explore some of these interventions and to theorize about the public character of the transformations that they provoke. Funded in part by a Mellon Foundation grant, this course is part of an initiative that aims to connect different disciplines to produce new knowledge, methods, and pedagogies for the understanding of metropolises worldwide.We will juxtapose different methodological and theoretical debates to address questions such as: how can we conceive of the public in cities connected globally by communication technologies? what are the spaces and mechanisms for contesting and reconfiguring these publics? what are the assumptions behind terms such as "global city," "megacity," and "world city"? how are cities branded, made into spectacles, and represented? what are the potentials and what are the limits of the "creative class" discourse in arts-based urban planning? how is civic inequality reproduced locally and transnationally? how do new urban practices and artistic interventions affect configurations of gender, race, and the representation of violence? how is precarity reproduced and aestheticized?These questions will be addressed through readings and the investigation of selected cases from both the Bay Area and international sites. Throughout, students will be exposed to and critically consider different kinds of methodologies, including interview methods, observation, discourse analysis, formal analysis, archival research, and photography. The course will incorporate symposia, roundtables, and other programming related to the Global Urban Humanities initiative and other events sponsored by the Arts Research Center, Global Metropolitan Studies, and the DCRP Lecture Series.This core course is one of three required courses for the upcoming graduate certificate in Global Urban Humanities.  Applications for the certificate are expected to be available in Spring 2017, and students taking this course can count it toward a future certificate.
	We encourage students to imagine, question, analyze, model and collaborate. Our curriculum is designed to promote critical thinking and to give students a balance of theory and practical skills, with the opportunity to link their education with their social and political commitments. We offer a variety of degrees to meet students’ various educational and career goals, preparing them to be leaders in urbanplanning, research, or related fields that address a wide range of urban issues.
	At the undergraduate level, we offer a four-year program leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in urban studies. This program offers both a liberal arts oriented and pre-professional education. We also offer an undergraduate minor program in city and regional planning, available to all majors at UC Berkeley.  At the graduate level, we offer a Master of City Planning (a two-year professional degree), with a variety of concentrations, and a Ph.D. in city and regional planning.Image: Anita RothThe study of cities is a vital part of a liberal arts curriculum.

The program introduces students to the domestic and international issues confronting efforts to promote more healthy cities, metropolitan regions, and places more generally, and we place a special emphasis on investigating strategies to address persistent health inequities in urban areas.Berkeley's concurrent program in city planning and public health is one of the oldest such programs in the United States. Building on the leadership and vision of program founders such as public health professors Leonard Duhl and Trevor Hancock and architecture professor Rosyln Lindheim, the concurrent MCP/MPH program grapples with understanding how urbanization and characteristics of urban life influence well-being and what practices and policies can improve the lives of the majority of the world's population now living in cities. The urban environment, and the planners and policies that shape it, influences many aspects of health and well-being: what people eat, the air they breathe and the water they drink, where (or if) they work, the housing that shelters them, where they go for health care, the danger they encounter on the street, who is available for emotional and financial support, and how political power is distributed and public resources allocated.While the fields of modern city planning and public health emerged together in the 19th century to address urban inequities and infectious diseases, they were largely disconnected for much of the 20th century. In the 21st century, planning and public health are reconnecting to address the new health challenges of urbanization and globalization — from racial and ethnic disparities to land use sprawl to providing basic services to the millions of urban poor around the world living in informal slum settlements. How to reconnect the fields of planning and public health to address these and other 21st century urban health challenges is the focus of the concurrent master's degree program in city planning and public health.Students and faculty affiliated with the program work closely with UC Berkeley's Center for Global Healthy Cities on action-research projects locally and around the world. The program trains students to think critically and apply knowledge to pressing problems using interdisciplinary research and practice methods and experiential learning. Outstanding students are offered financial aid and research assistantship opportunities, and many are encouraged to continue for a Ph.D. at Berkeley, such as through our Global Health Equity Scholars program focus on Slum Health.Students must complete the required core courses in both the city and regional planning and public health programs. Students must also take CY PLAN 256 Healthy Cities by the end of their second year and are strongly encouraged to take PB HLTH 267D Health Impact Assessment. Students can select any concentration area in planning and public health; however, we strongly recommend that students consult with core faculty before selecting concentration areas. Participation in program seminar series and a summer internship is also required. Students will complete one capstone project that satisifies both the M.C.P. and M.P.H. degrees. Students must seek approval for their final project by the end of their fourth semester.The program is co-directed by Jason Corburn, Associate Professor of City and Regional Planning, and William Satariano, Professor of Epidemiology and Community Health.

Admission is for the fall semester of the following year. We do not accept spring-semester admissions. Please see Graduate Admissions for application deadlines and procedures. For statistics on last year's M.C.P. admission cycle — number of applications received, number of applicants admitted, average GPA, age range, gender breakdown, etc. — see Admission Statistics.Minimum requirements for admission include:Other factors that weigh heavy  in the review process include your statemens (Statement of Purpose, Personal History Statment), letters of recommendation and work experience. Be sure to submit recommendations from individuals who know you well and can speak for the quality of your work. One or two recommendations should be submitted from people who are in position to appraise your depth of character and commitment, work effectiveness, ability to work with people and leadership potential on the job or in community activities. At least one should come from someone who can evaluate your performance in academic settings. The two statements, as a unit, should clearly present why you are interested in a planning career, your goals, and what you hope to achieve in a Berkeley professional program. Work in this field requires at a minimum the ability to write well and the ability to master analytic skills in quantitative methods. It also requires some familiarity with political institutions and governmental organizations. DCRP expects entering students to demonstrate basic skills/conceptual understanding in the following areas:THESE PREREQUISITES ARE NOT REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION. Any student who shows potential and meets general UC Berkeley Admission requirements as well as current DCRP criteria, may be admitted. Charisma Acey, Jason Corburn, Malo Hutson, John Radke, Jennifer Wolch (on leave as dean of UC Berkeley's College of Environmental Design)The environmental planning and health cities concentration is designed to give MCP students a broad knowledge of the relationship between the built environment and the natural environment, as well as specific technical skills that can be applied professionally to solve environmental problems. Environmental issues affect every aspect of planning, so it is necessary to have an understanding of history, theory, institutions, economics, law, quantitative and qualitative methods, urban design, and natural factors. The program is particularly concerned with the relationship between human settlements and the natural environment. Students are encouraged to consider how negative environmental impacts can be mitigated through the development of alternative approaches to urban settlement patterns, urban design, and infrastructure systems. Both physical planning and non-spatial policy affect environmental planning and policy.Joint degree programs are encouraged and students can receive two degrees in three years with the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning (M.C.P. & M.L.A.) and the School of Public Health (M.C.P. and Masters in Public Health, M.P.H.).Nezar AlSayyad, Teresa Caldeira, Karen Chapple, Carol Galante, Malo Hutson, Carolina Reid, Jennifer Wolch (on leave as dean of UC Berkeley's College of Environmental Design)The housing, community and economic development (HCED) concentration focuses on the equitable development of neighborhoods, cities and regions in the United States and internationally. This concentration is distinguished by its attention to issues of racial, social and economic justice within the built environment, often from the perspective of historically disinvested and segregated communities.  Faculty in this concentration work on topics such as:Faculty within the HCED concentration draw on multidisciplinary perspectives including research in anthropology, economic, history, and sociology, and incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methods in their research.  Students in this concentration go on to work in a wide variety of roles in the public and private sectors.  We encourage students to take classes in all three concentration subfields, since in practice they are closely intertwined. Daniel Chatman, Karen Frick, Daniel Rodriguez, Paul Waddell The transportation planning concentration focuses on planning for urban transportation and land use systems, and interactions of transportation and land use with the built, natural, and social environments. In presenting the social, economic, and environmental implications of transportation and land use plans and policies, and promoting economic efficiency, green transport, resource conservation, and environmental protection, the courses in the concentration are focused around themes of equity, environmental justice, and social welfare. We emphasize the planning and policy challenges encountered by attempting to increase the use of environmentally sustainable travel modes such as walking, cycling and public transit, and the creation of environmentally sustainable land use patterns such as compact growth and transit-oriented development. Topics covered in the core courses include the impacts of transit and highways on urban form and economic development; the impacts of urban form, transit-oriented development and new urbanism on travel behavior; governance, finance, and implementation challenges in making sustainable transport investments; the importance of highway and transit finance, municipal finance, and development finance; the promises and pitfalls of innovative sustainability solutions such as congestion pricing, parking pricing, and master development plans; streets and pedestrian- oriented designs; transportation and land use planning in the developing world; and comparative international transportation and land use policies.As concerns heighten over regional mobility, air quality, global climate change, energy, and equality of access, it is increasingly important that transportation and land use planners apply a multi-disciplinary approach to the field. Accordingly, students in the concentration are encouraged to augment the department’s transportation course offerings by designing a study program, in consultation with their advisor that involves course work in other fields and departments.Students in the transportation planning concentration may seek to pursue the concurrent degree program in transportation planning and engineering. This option confers both the M.C.P. and the M.S. upon students who complete 60 units of course work, normally over five semesters. For further information about concurrent M.C.P./M.S. degree requirements, contact Professor Dan Chatman at dgc@berkeley.edu. Nezar AlSayyad, Karen Frick, Elizabeth MacdonaldUrban designers are concerned with how communities look, how they feel, and how they work for the people who use them. The urban design concentration is structured to give M.C.P. students the knowledge necessary to design urban built form in relation to social, environmental and economic concerns. “Design” is a key, operative word: urban designers design urban physical environments both directly through the design of actual projects and indirectly through plans. Work ranges in scale from small public spaces and streets to neighborhoods, citywide systems, and whole regions. The emphasis is typically on the public realm of cities, with central concerns being livability, identity, place-making, and the quality of everyday life. The concentration is equally concerned with conceptions of the “urban” and it draws on approaches from the disciplines of city planning, architecture, landscape architecture, as well as theories and methods from the social sciences with the intent of analyzing the urban condition and designing the urban realm. The studio experience is central to the urban design concentration. Working in teams and individually, students explore planning and design possibilities for urban places and learn to articulate and present their ideas in graphic form. Learning from local and global contexts, and how cities have been designed in the past, students envision possibilities for the future. Graduates in urban design work for public agencies largely at the local government level but also for government institutions at larger scales whose responsibilities include design issues. They work as well with private architectural, landscape, city planning, and community development firms whose clients are both public and private.Students concentrating in urban design often have some design background, typically in architecture, landscape architecture, environmental design, or urban planning with a design emphasis, but a design background is not required.A three- or four-year joint degree program in urban design is available with the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning, where students receive both the M.C.P. and the M.L.A. degree. A joint degree is also available with the Department of Architecture, where students receive both M.C.P. and M.Arch degrees.  DCRP and UC Berkeley offer multiple types of financial support to its graduate students. The Graduate Division website describes the various forms of support, including information on Academic Student Employee (ASE) appointments and fee remissions, related salaries and appointment requirements.Faculty hire GSRs based on available research funding throughout the year. GSR appointments may be short term or up to a year in length, and may or may not include a fee remission. Salary is based on the complexity of assigned work, and skill-set of the student. As faculty grants are approved at various times during the year, we encourage students to contact faculty directly and to pay attention to email notices of new GSR appointments. The vast majority of GSR appointments are through one of the campus ORUs (organized research units), such as Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD) in CED. More information on GSR appointments can be found on Graduate Division website.DCRP and UC Berkeley offer multiple types of graduate fellowships:PhD Students in DCRP are awarded multi-year offers that often cover the normative time or five years. These offers vary from competitive UC awards such as the Berkeley Fellowship to departmental awards that include fellowship and ASE appointments. UC offers a full year of DCF or Dissertation Completion Fellowship which covers in-state tuition and provides a fellowship stipend.MCP Student awards range from the UC Graduate Opportunity Award (GOP) targeted specifically towards diversity applicants, to departmental awards such as Block Grants, PDST awards, UCConnect awards for U.S. transportation students, and other departmental fellowships.Incoming MCP students’ awards are primarily based on merit, with a select few based on diversity (GOP). These awards cover some part of tuition for one or two semesters in the first year, and/or provide a fellowship stipend. Award levels vary from $3,000 on up, and are typically higher in the first year than provided in the second year of study.Continuing students and incoming students who have not received initial funding offers are able to submit fellowship applications in early August for need-based support. The MCP Program Committee reviews the requests and may award limited fellowships to students who will not hold appointments and can demonstrate need and merit. A final round of need-based awards are made for Spring semester in late Fall, depending on available fellowship resources. Graduate Advisors send out the solicitation for applications in early August and again in January.We recognize the cost of graduate education and the need for many students to seek out other types of aid during their studies, including obtaining loans. The UC Berkeley Financial Aid office works with students who need to learn of additional forms of funding. International students are eligible for most DCRP and UC fellowships; however they have special requirements for obtaining visa and entry to the U.S. and must show proof of funding for a minimum of one year. The Berkeley International Office offers comprehensive services to international students on obtaining visas, financial aid, housing etc.All U.S. citizens and residents who are in receipt of any type of financial aid or fellowships MUST file the FAFSA.Public information posted in accordance with the standards of the Planning Accreditation Board,Master of City PlanningDCRP provides its many Master of City Planning graduates with:*Includes one-time Document Management Fee and yearly Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition (PDST).

If you do not want to teach in planning or a related field, or to do advanced research, please reconsider applying to this program. Most doctoral students enter the program with a master's degree in planning or a related field. The Master of City Planning is regarded as a terminal professional degree, and is not comparable to mid-study Master of Arts or Master of Science degrees offered in anticipation of the doctorate.Admission to the doctoral program is very competitive. Only six to eight students are admitted each year, sometimes from a pool of as many as 80 applicants. All applicants to the doctoral program (even those required to take an English-language competency exam (TOEFL, TOEFL CBT, iBT TOEFL, or IELTS)) must take the Graduate Record Examination; tests should be taken before December to ensure timely receipt of scores. Applicants must also secure at least three letters of recommendation that can explicitly evaluate their intellectual capability and past research and academic work.Please note that admission decisions are not made by individual faculty, but rather an admissions committee. DCRP's PhD admissions process begins with three initial reviews of your application: the two faculty members you list as preferred advisors and one member of the PhD admission committee. The admission committee then meets to review all applications as a cohort and make admission/denial decisions.DCRP and UC Berkeley offer multiple types of financial support to its graduate students. Details are available here.DCRP and UC Berkeley offer multiple types of financial support to its graduate students. The Graduate Division website describes the various forms of support, including information on Academic Student Employee (ASE) appointments and fee remissions, related salaries and appointment requirements.Faculty hire GSRs based on available research funding throughout the year. GSR appointments may be short term or up to a year in length, and may or may not include a fee remission. Salary is based on the complexity of assigned work, and skill-set of the student. As faculty grants are approved at various times during the year, we encourage students to contact faculty directly and to pay attention to email notices of new GSR appointments. The vast majority of GSR appointments are through one of the campus ORUs (organized research units), such as Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD) in CED. More information on GSR appointments can be found on Graduate Division website.DCRP and UC Berkeley offer multiple types of graduate fellowships:PhD Students in DCRP are awarded multi-year offers that often cover the normative time or five years. These offers vary from competitive UC awards such as the Berkeley Fellowship to departmental awards that include fellowship and ASE appointments. UC offers a full year of DCF or Dissertation Completion Fellowship which covers in-state tuition and provides a fellowship stipend.MCP Student awards range from the UC Graduate Opportunity Award (GOP) targeted specifically towards diversity applicants, to departmental awards such as Block Grants, PDST awards, UCConnect awards for U.S. transportation students, and other departmental fellowships.Incoming MCP students’ awards are primarily based on merit, with a select few based on diversity (GOP). These awards cover some part of tuition for one or two semesters in the first year, and/or provide a fellowship stipend. Award levels vary from $3,000 on up, and are typically higher in the first year than provided in the second year of study.Continuing students and incoming students who have not received initial funding offers are able to submit fellowship applications in early August for need-based support. The MCP Program Committee reviews the requests and may award limited fellowships to students who will not hold appointments and can demonstrate need and merit. A final round of need-based awards are made for Spring semester in late Fall, depending on available fellowship resources. Graduate Advisors send out the solicitation for applications in early August and again in January.We recognize the cost of graduate education and the need for many students to seek out other types of aid during their studies, including obtaining loans. The UC Berkeley Financial Aid office works with students who need to learn of additional forms of funding. International students are eligible for most DCRP and UC fellowships; however they have special requirements for obtaining visa and entry to the U.S. and must show proof of funding for a minimum of one year. The Berkeley International Office offers comprehensive services to international students on obtaining visas, financial aid, housing etc.All U.S. citizens and residents who are in receipt of any type of financial aid or fellowships MUST file the FAFSA. The Center for Environmental Design Research (CEDR) is a center that fosters research in environmental planning and design, ranging from the local environments of people within buildings to region-wide ecosystems, Research at CEDR is highly interdisciplinary utilizing skills and knowledge of people across campus in civil & environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering & computer science, public health, public policy, psychology, business, energy & resources, and more. The Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD) is a center that aims to critically investigate and help improve processes and outcomes that shape urban equity around the world through the collaborative and interdisciplinary research of students, faculty, and visiting scholars. Over its long history, IURD has sponsored research in numerous disciplines. Principal research areas involve creating inclusive cities, urban governance, healthy cities, place and mobility, understanding city science, and urban environment. In all of its research projects, IURD emphasizes interdisciplinary and cooperative study. As the first school to combine the disciplines of architecture, planning, and landscape architecture into a single college, CED was also among the first to conceptualize environmental design as inseparable from its social, political-economic, and cultural contexts. Across all three departments, CED’s faculty research local and global challenges with this unique concept of environmental design in mind. One of the premier architecture, landscape architecture, and city and regional planning libraries in North America, the Environmental Design Library includes more than 210,000 volumes and subscriptions, as well as thousands of electronic resources from around the world used to support the teaching and research programs of the College of Environmental Design. CED’s library contains a myriad of department specific collections, rare and limited edition books and original reproductions, as well as reference and research services provided by CED’s friendly and knowledgeable librarians.  The Environmental Design Archives holds more than 200 collections documenting the built and landscaped environment. These records span more than a century, 1890-2014, and contain primary source materials such as correspondence, reports, specifications, drawings, photographs, models, and artifacts. The Archives holds records of not only California’s early important architects, but also contemporary and lesser-known architects and designers from around the world.  The Visual Resources center is a library of teaching and research images, with over 82,000 digital images, over 300,000 35mm slides, and 37,000 lantern slides depicting architecture, landscapes, cities, and related material. In addition to the Center’s extensive collection of images, it also provides services that help faculty and students create digital images for classroom use, create digital images from slides or archival material, and to create digital version of 35mm slides and Lantern slides in the Center’s collection for teaching use.  The Cal Design Lab at Wurster Hall is an experimental studio space that promotes hands-on, interdisciplinary design activities. Faculty and students from UC Berkeley’s many schools and departments come together at the Cal Design Lab to work on critical design challenges. The goal of the lab is to be a nexus for design research and practice, and to facilitate discourse that transcends different design disciplines. The lab offers formal space for transdisciplinary seminars and projects, as well as informal space for student teams to work and interact with design coaches or mentors.  The College of Environmental Design offers several introductory summer programs for those interested in exploring the fields of architecture, landscape architecture and environmental planning, urban design and sustainable city planning. CED also offers workshops in the basics of fabrication as well as techniques and technologies that push the boundaries of making.POST-BACCALAUREATE. The Summer [IN]STITUTE consists of [IN]ARCH, [IN]LAND and [IN]CITY, three introductory programs in architecture, landscape architecture and city planning for post-baccalaureate students or senior-level undergraduates, and [IN]ARCH ADV, an advanced studio for students who have an undergraduate degree in architecture or who are senior-level architecture majors.

Why are gardens necessary? Why are the things we build the largest driver of environmental change? And what can we do about it? This course will teach anyone how to start to be a designer, not just of drawings and objects, but also buildings, landscapes and urban spaces; And not just in isolation, but in the complex web of ecological and man-made systems which makes up our shifting environment. You will take from the course first-hand experience of drawing, measuring, and design — which form the basis of the professions of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning— and which culminate in a final design project in the course. You will also learn how practitioners from antiquity to the present have thought and written about the problems designers still face today; how to draw, how to build, and how to make meaningful places in a constantly changing world. The course is open to all undergraduate students in the College of Environmental Design as well as other colleges and majors, with no prior experience assumed or required.ENV DES 198 [Staff] Information about the speakers for this lecture series is available here>>Below are currently offered courses for the fall 2017 semester.

The architecture studios are formal, intensive, and structured for experimentation with physical ideas. We create through models (physical and digital), drawing, photography, collage, montage, diagram, scanning, mapping, and writing as we work. The architecture studio will become a place of refuge to develop a new lens for seeing and understanding the world around you. In studio you will learn how to transform invisible ideas into form. [IN]ARCH consists of a multi-disciplinary lecture series, a design studio, and a media course, taught by faculty and graduate students from the Department of Architecture. Participants should expect to spend a significant amount of time working independently outside of formal instruction hours. After fulfilling the program requirements, participants receive a certificate of completion.To enroll in this course, you must be accepted to the Summer [IN]STITUTE. For information on how to apply, visit the CED Summer Programs website.​[IN]ARCH ADV is an advanced architectural studio formulated to push the boundaries of architectural thinking and design. The architecture studios are formal, intensive and structured for experimentation with physical ideas. Participants will make models (physical and digital), draw, photograph, collage, montage, diagram, print, scan, map and write as they work. The studio becomes a place for participants to transform thoughts and ideas into form. Studio lessons establish and fortify links between architecture and the allied arts. While dealing with landscape, site, function and program, many pursuits reflect immediate and direct associations with music, painting, collage, literature, dance, theater, filmmaking and the human body, all of which exist in the sub-patterns of design.The [IN]ARCH ADV studio places emphasis on an iterative process and deploys three recurring methods for making: analog drawing and photomontage, to connect the eye's critical observations to the hand's critical description; digital modeling, to explore conceptual ideas through 3D digital models; and physical modeling, to develop and embody material ideas in model form using the Digital Fabrication Lab.To enroll in this course, you must be accepted to the Summer [IN]STITUTE. For information on how to apply, visit the CED Summer Programs website.The [IN]CITY program provides students with introductory skills in urban planning and policy methods, including data collection/analysis, physical planning, mapping and visual representation. Students will also gain a broad knowledge on sustainability planning and learn how to translate sustainability objectives into clear scopes of action. They will also develop the ability to express planning and policy matters in to clear verbal and graphic terms while learning how to work effectively with other students, professors and clients through hands-on team projects. Students will be introduced to land use policies and urban development processes and develop critical thinking, observation, and analysis regarding an understanding of cities. [IN]CITY consists of a multi-disciplinary lecture series, smaller discipline-specific lectures, a planning studio, and field work led by faculty and graduate students from the Department of Architecture. Participants should expect to spend a significant amount of time working independently outside of formal instruction hours.

Participants will make models (physical and digital), draw, photograph, collage, montage, diagram, print, scan, map and write as they work. The studio becomes a place for participants to transform thoughts and ideas into form. Studio lessons establish and fortify links between architecture and the allied arts. While dealing with landscape, site, function and program, many pursuits reflect immediate and direct associations with music, painting, collage, literature, dance, theater, filmmaking and the human body, all of which exist in the sub-patterns of design.The [IN]ARCH ADV studio places emphasis on an iterative process and deploys three recurring methods for making: analog drawing and photomontage, to connect the eye's critical observations to the hand's critical description; digital modeling, to explore conceptual ideas through 3D digital models; and physical modeling, to develop and embody material ideas in model form using the Digital Fabrication Lab.To enroll in this course, you must be accepted into the Summer [IN]STITUTE. For information on how to apply, visit the CED Summer Programs website.The [IN]CITY program provides students with introductory skills in urban planning and policy methods, including data collection/analysis, physical planning, mapping and visual representation. Students will also gain a broad knowledge on sustainability planning and learn how to translate sustainability objectives into clear scopes of action. They will also develop the ability to express planning and policy matters in to clear verbal and graphic terms while learning how to work effectively with other students, professors and clients through hands-on team projects. Students will be introduced to land use policies and urban development processes and develop critical thinking, observation, and analysis regarding an understanding of cities. [IN]CITY consists of a multi-disciplinary lecture series, smaller discipline-specific lectures, a planning studio, and field work led by faculty and graduate students from the Department of Architecture. Participants should expect to spend a significant amount of time working independently outside of formal instruction hours. After fulfilling the program requirements, participants receive a certificate of completion.To enroll in this course, you must be accepted into the Summer [IN]STITUTE. For information on how to apply, visit the CED Summer Programs website.The [IN]LAND program introduces students to the different scales and aspects of landscape architecture and environmental planning. "People and Processes" describes the overall theme for the program, in which we investigate how to evince and design for social and natural processes in the urban environment. The six-week program is divided into two studio projects. Project sites are located within the San Francisco Bay Area so that we can visit them.Throughout the program, field trips will enhance understanding of the studio projects. The media course complements the studio course by allowing students to develop their representation skills, both hand (analog) and digital. The lecture series consists of professors and practicing professionals, who will expose the students to the wide variety of professional and academic avenues that can be taken within the disciplines of landscape architecture and environmental planning. A weekly section meets to discuss the lecture and reading assignments, allowing students to develop their skills of critical discussion and knowledge sharing. This course will also develop your foundation skills across a variety of medium between analog and digital production from photo editing, portfolio making, and digital form-finding. Participants should expect to spend a significant amount of time working independently outside of formal instruction hours. After fulfilling the program requirements, participants receive a certificate of completion.To enroll in this course, you must be accepted into the Summer [IN]STITUTE.

Through a combination of design and digital fabrication, studio sessions, lectures and seminars, demos and workshops, field work and site visits, students will be able to engage in the discourse of urban innovation, while gaining hands on experience developing design proposals.
 
The program is built upon four main platforms. The Urban Innovation Talk - Keynote Lecture Series introduces students to some of the most forward-thinking researchers and practitioners from the Bay Area design community. Fieldwork + Site visits give students an opportunity to engage directly with the dynamic built and natural environment of the Bay Area, while meeting with expert guest speakers. The Global Cities/Global Communities + Urban Innovation Seminars are meant to develop a theoretical framework for understanding the complex urban issues that face cities and strategies for design. The Studio + Digital Workshops are at the core of the program, building skills and offering a hands-on makerspace for creative work to take place. Working in teams, students develop a project from design conception to final prototyping and present the final result of their work to instructors and guest critics.
 
Upon completion of the DISC program, graduates have a strong understanding of urban processes and a broad toolkit with which to tackle its urgent demands, as well as compelling artifacts for their academic portfolio. Students develop the necessary skills and theory to effectively represent their design ideas and become the next thought shapers and game changers.Participants should expect to spend a significant amount of time working independently outside of formal instruction hours. After fulfilling the program requirements, participants receive a certificate of completion.To enroll in this course, you must be accepted into the Disc*2017 program.

How can we describe these connections—give them form—through paintings, drawings and related works involving the hand?Music and place have long been intertwined—and the particulars of place have given rise to some of our most memorable songs. In the fall semester course we explore this question through the American roots song tradition. In the spring semester course we continue the exploration, concentrating now on the folksongs of Mexico (el cancionero mexicano, the classical corrido/ranchera/bolero tradition) including songs recorded by Chavela Vargas, José Alfredo Jiménez, Agustín Lara, Guty Cárdenas, Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante, Davíd Zaizar, Elvira Ríos, Las Jilguerillas, Cuco Sánchez, Lola Beltrán, Dueto Caleta, Los Alegres de Terán y otros. We'll look closely at (and listen to) this material with an eye to the visual sources for the songs--and the ways in which they stem from--and reflect--Mexican culture. La Canción del Alma y el Alma de la Canción. The lyrics are primarily in Spanish, of course--and Spanish language comprehension  will be important for students in the class. A sub-theme will be the ways in which individuals today reflect (represent) this past--especially young people of Mexican ancestry "a este lado de la frontera." A persistent question might be: who were "los abuelitos de tus abuelitos..." and what would it mean to picture them? Place? Region? Family? Home? Caras y caretas...? We'll explore these themes in visual terms (by making paintings and drawings)--and by listening to--and singing--the songs... Readings will include Octavio Paz, El Laberinto de la Soledad, Guillermo Bonfil-Batalla, México profundo and selections from Yolando Moreno Rivas, Historia de la música popular méxicana.  A second sub-theme: how do Mexican folk traditions persisit today?Note that this is a seminar-with-projects—a course in which we look closely at the original connection between songs and places—and make images in response. The medium here is open—but the hand is emphasized throughout. We'll begin each week by listening to/looking at  a selection of songs and images. Studio projects follow (outside of class). We then reconvene the following week, to sing the songs, discuss the readings, and review the work made by each person in the group. Followed by a new set of songs. Your guide to all this, Anthony Dubovsky is a painter who is also a professor in the Visual Studies Program in the CED. He takes a keen interest in these songs and the places and traditions they represent. The class will be a joint exploration, in Spanish as well as English.Prerequisites? At least some studio art and music background. A firm grasp of Spanish is required, and genuine interest in the subject. Familiarity with Mexican/Latinoamerican culture(s) a plus. Class size will be limited to 15 students. Open to juniors, seniors, and graduate students with the necessary background.Application procedures: Send me an email with the following: Your name. Where were you born? Where did you grow up? Your year (junior, senior, grad)? Your Major? Musical background? Art background? Spanish language background? Tell me about your interest in this class, and something of your family story. Include 2-4 jpegs of your artwork (identified with YOUR NAME on each jpeg) and send to Anthony Dubovsky at chambersstreet[at]hotmail.com.  Applications are due by 15 January 2017; earlier applications will be given stronger consideration.Painting: Anthony Dubovsky, La Guelaguetza, Oaxaca, 1935, acylic/cardboard, 6-3/4 x 6 inchesIf you have difficulty adding this class in CalCentral please contact Tony directly via email chambersstreet[at]hotmail.comThis is a class about imagination and ideas. A road trip, perhaps—or a voyage. We begin each week with a theme—often a single word---as point of departure. Each person in the group does a project in response—a drawing, a painting, a collage—the medium is open. In the following class we look at the work, and a conversation ensues. And then, a new word.Note that the hand is important throughout--how the sense of touch becomes a guide.Following this format, the class develops a certain rhythm--a kind of opening. Not just in terms of skill (although skill can play a part), but more in finding the right visual language to give form to one’s feelings about and understanding of the surrounding world. A challenge that carries over into any of the design fields—and beyond…. Important: Since discussion is central to each class, students need to be fully confident in spoken English—both comprehension and conversation.Required: One project each week, made with energy and commitment... Attendance at all class meetings, and a well-crafted book with reproductions of your work, including a short essay about your journey, due at the end of the term. Open to grad students and some seniors from all departments, but limited in enrollment to 12 students.  This can be a good place to explore your initial thesis ideas.If you're interested, send Anthony Dubovsky an e-mail with a paragraph or two about yourself and your backgound in the arts, along with 2-3 jpegs of your work.

How can we describe these connections — give them form?Music and place have long been intertwined, and the particulars of place have given rise to some of our most memorable songs: "On the Banks of the Ohio," "Shenandoah," "Red River Valley," "Sweet Home Chicago,” “Lonesome Whistle,” “Oh Mary Don’t You Weep.” Whether the folk lyrics from a Russian village on the banks of the Pripyet, or a single line from a shepherd’s flute in the Carpathian mountains, the songster licks of John Hurt down in Avalon, Mississippi, or a precisely bent blues note on a red electric guitar from Muddy Waters in Southside Chicago — the connection is endlessly evocative. However, we live in a world where traditional places — and the traditional songs that come from them — have been rapidly disappearing, inundated by the juggernaut of an international commercial culture which supplants (dis-places/re-places) them entirely--a primary characteristic of our times…In this seminar-with-projects course we will investigate these changes by listening—by looking closely at the original connection between songs and places — and by making images in response. The medium will be open — drawing, painting, collage, writing, hybrid forms all acceptable. We’ll begin each week by listening to some songs — and learning to sing them. Together with a selection of visual images. Studio projects follow, outside of class. We then reconvene, the following week, to look at and discuss the work. Followed by a new set of songs. Note that during the fall term the course emphasizes American folk songs; the spring term presents the international version (Argentina, Russia, México to date.)Prerequisites? Upper-division standing. At least some studio art and music background. Class size limited to 15 students. Open to all majors. Application procedures: Send me an email with the following: Your name. Your age. Where were you born? Where did you grow up? Your year (junior, senior, grad)? Your major? Musical background? Art background?

At the core of this class is the desire to go deep within ourselves and explore how we can artistically and critically materialize the intimate relationship between our body/mind and the arts. Some of the situated questions we will raise are, for example: What aesthetic principles underlie and inform our practices? How do we see the boundaries between Design, Art, Photography and our lives? What is our relation to light, darkness, and color? How do we acknowledge our construction of reality through our senses and lenses?Through diverse subjects centered around Body / Mind ( self portrait,  the bare body, a surreal moment, metamorphosis, transparency );  and the creative gesture ( no -gravity, still life , wrapping , the unknown ) , this class will focus on restructuring our experience across the fields of visual and performing arts – including painting, sculpture, design, installation and performance. We will be committed to explore photography as an Experiential  (including conceptual) Art and NOT as a documentary practice. You will be encouraged to think of each exercise as being a (sometimes highly designed) visual poem condensing your critical position, humor, thoughts and feelings on the subjects mentioned above. Our photographic production will lean towards a “new Social Surrealism” which I could best describe as: set up or staged “portraits of our time,” photographs as paintings, advertising or (slightly) burlesque compositions, theatrical narratives or artistic essays. In short, you will be required to show, through your photographs, your critical distance in relation to  your sensual and intellectual understanding of each theme.Since the class is not solely about photography and not about photographic techniques, there is no restriction as to what tools you could use: analog or digital cameras, scanning devices, stylus drawing tools can all be put to use to enrich your aesthetic vision. Although you may use Photoshop in no more than two projects, I do not encourage its use for I want to see your resourcefulness and creativity through your direct sensual experience. Regarding your previous experience with photography, you may be in a much better position if you have already taken a photography class but some students have done well with no experience.For each weekly assignment everyone is expected to produce a large-format photograph (a minimum of  20" wide) in B & W or in color. Everyone is also expected to present their work-in-progress on two other boards, showing the various stages of your creative process, including, for example: your 3 best pictures of the week, contact prints of weekly training exercises, copies of your conceptual sketches and library research. Each weekly meeting will be centered around a pin-up of the work and a class critique in which you’ll learn to become a critic/student/teacher and relate your observations to design, photography, the arts, your own field of interest, and your life in general. The group critique will be the major tool to develop our growth and understanding; please take this class only if you are planning to give your full oral participation during these class pin-ups. If you are not from the Architecture Department, please be aware that critiques may appear devastatingly brutal at first. Final grade will be based on the average evaluation of all 9 projects and home work and on a final critique and show presented in the Wurster lobby.This is a class that requires a lot of work  (for 4 units and not 1-4 as described in the computer format),  time commitment and heart. It is not advised to take an architectural design studio at the same time, although a few have managed to do it. Taking the class for P, N/P is not accepted. Final class selection will be available on the Wednesday after our first class meeting on Monday, based on a short questionnaire collected the first day, and a short interview that will take place on  the Tuesday following the first class, from 5 to 8 PM in my office, 349 Wurster Hall, during which I would love to see any of your work in Design or the Visual Arts, including sketches and finished works .

Make sure your name is on each jpeg. Send before January 15 to the following email address: chambersstreet[at]hotmail.com. Earlier applications will receive priority. Class # 12204
Painting: Anthony Dubovsky, Anhelo, acrylic on cardboard, 2013Image from the newly release book Body Unbound by Jean-Paul BourdierIf we see our passage on earth as a theatrical play, what snapshots of our experiences would we wish to share with our contemporaries? At the core of this class is the desire to go deep within ourselves and explore how we can artistically and critically materialize the intimate relationship between our body/mind and the arts. Some of the situated questions we will raise are, for example: What aesthetic principles underlie and inform our practices? How do we see the boundaries between Design, Art, and Photography? What is our relation to light, darkness, and color? How do we acknowledge our construction of reality through our senses and lenses?Through diverse subjects centered around Body / Mind ( self portrait,  the bare body, a surreal moment, sex race and gender, metamorphosis );  and the creative gesture ( light and shadows, still life , wrapping , the unknown, portrait of an artist ) , this class will focus on restructuring our experience across the fields of visual and performing arts – including painting, sculpture, design, installation and performance. We will be committed to explore photography as an Experiential  (or conceptual) Art and NOT as a documentary practice. You will be encouraged to think of each exercise as being a (sometimes highly designed) visual poem condensing your critical position, humor, thoughts and feelings on the subjects mentioned above. Our photographic production will lean towards a “new Social Surrealism” which I could best describe as: set up or staged “portraits of our time,” photographs as paintings, advertising or (slightly) burlesque compositions, theatrical narratives or artistic essays. In short, you will be required to show, through your photographs, your critical distance vis a vis your sensual and intellectual understanding of each theme.Since the class is not solely about photography and not about photographic techniques, there is no restriction as to what tools you could use: analog or digital cameras, scanning devices, stylus drawing tools and Photoshop can all be put to use to enrich your aesthetic vision. Regarding your previous experience with photography, you may be in a much better position if you have already taken a photography class but some students have done well with no experience.For each weekly assignment everyone is expected to produce a large-format photograph (a maximum of  20" wide) in B & W or in color. Everyone is also expected to present their work-in-progress on two other boards, showing the various stages of your creative process, including, for example: your 3 best pictures of the week, contact prints of weekly training exercises, copies of your conceptual sketches, library research notes and critical comments on your classmates main assignment . Each weekly meeting will be centered around a pin-up of the work and a class critique in which you’ll learn to become a critic/student/teacher and relate your observations to design, photography, the arts, your own field of interest, and your life in general. The group critique will be the major tool to develop our growth and understanding; please take this class only if you are planning to give your full participation during these class pin-ups.  If you are not from the Architecture Department, please be aware that critiques may appear devastatingly brutal at first. Final grade will be based on the average evaluation of all 9 projects and home work and on a final critique and show presented in the Wurster lobby.This is a class that requires a lot of work  ( for 4 units and not 1-4 as described in the computer format ),  time commitment and heart. It is not advised to take an architectural design studio at the same time, although a few have managed to do it. Taking the class for P , N/P is not accepted. Final class selection will be available on the Wednesday after our first class meeting on Monday, based on a short questionnaire collected the first day, and a short interview that will probably take place on Tuesday following the first class, from 5 to 7-8 PM in my office, 349 Wurster Hall, during which I would love to see any of your work in the visual arts. In other words, since being registered in the class is by consent of the instructor, the waiting list serves only as a temporary reference and does not imply that you’ll be included in the class, just as not being on the waiting list does not mean that you cannot get in.

Prerequisites: Environmental Design 11A-11B or consent of instructor. This studio introduces students to the programmatic, artistic, and technical aspects of land form and topographic adjustments to accommodate human use. Topics include pedestrian and vehicular circulation, conservation and addition of plant materials, movement of water, recreation use, and creation of views. Sculptural land forms will be emphasized through the use of topographic plans, sections, and contour models.This course, through a studio format, introduces the concepts, principles and techniques required to design landscapes. The studio is a hands-on experience where students will produce drawings, models and other artifacts to convey their design solutions for the projects assigned.In the first year landscape architectural studio sequence, it is our intention that students begin to learn to manipulate the three key formal elements available to the landscape designer - the land (topography), architectural form (walls, pavements, small structural objects and furnishings) and vegetation.Although the projects in this studio will require some experimentation with all three, we will concentrate primarily on the skills required to manipulate topography. (5) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 101, 102, Environmental Design 11A-11B, (Arch 100A or 100B for Architecture students) or by consent of instructor. This is an undergraduate studio with a central focus on climate modification for energy conservation. We will research historical precedents in order to develop new garden forms for passive green designs. We will also explore how past cultures integrated metaphysics into their gardens as an adjunct to microclimate and habitat design. The contemporary landscape should be a balanced interweaving of proportion, function, comfort, energy conservation, and enlightenment. Additionally, we will study the choreography of space and investigate how to animate the landscape through the creative interpretation of text and film. Many new and exciting opportunities lie ahead for the creation of garden forms that not only conserve energy, but are also works of art and places of spiritual renewal.(4) Three hours of lecture per week. Analysis of environmental factors, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem dynamics, as related to decision-making for landscape planning and design.Ecological analysis is concerned with developing an understanding of natural factors of the environment. How these factors relate to one another and how they must be considered in landscape design and land use planning are primary concerns of the course. Eight factors will be considered: topography, geology, climate, soil, hydrology, flora, vegetation and fauna. The interactions of these factors in ecosystems will also be explored along with the basic concepts of landscape ecology.The lecture formats will be used to present the material. Lectures are scheduled Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8:00 AM in room 315A Wurster Hall.Grading will be based on laboratory reports (100 points), homework problems (100 points), one mid-term examination (200 points), a laboratory final (100 points), and a final examination (400 points).  Letter grades will be assigned on a percentage basis (90 to 100% = A; 80 to 89% = B; 70 to 79% = C; 60 to 69% = D; <60% = F).The required readings for LA 110 are collected in a reader, which is available from a local copy service (Copy Central on Bancroft Avenue). The reader is also on reserve in the Environmental Design Library. Numerous maps, tables, and diagrams are used in the lectures. These have been put together in "An Illustrated Outline of Ecological Analysis" which is also available from a Copy Central.(2) Four hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Landscape Architecture 110 (may be taken concurrently). Introduction to field techniques for assessment of landscape factors. Factors include topography, geology, climate, soil, hydrology, flora, vegetation, and wildlife.(3) Three hours of lecture per week. Through lecture, research, and studio assignments, this course introduces the use of plants as design elements in the landscape, from the urban scale to the site-specific scale, focusing on the public open space. By analyzing historic, contemporary, and Bay Area examples, the course examines the spatial, visual, and sensory qualities of vegetation, as well as the interplay with ecological functions and engineering uses of plants.This course focuses on urban planting design as a technological and aesthetic practice rooted in natural and cultural precedent. Coursework and readings will emphasize the dynamic role of plants in cities and the inherent complexity of designing with a living medium.  Weekly lectures, practicums, and analytical exercises will synthesize subjects covered in the course and provide students with an intellectual framework, reliable methodology, and contemporary skillset to approach planting design in urbanized areas. The course requires extensive out of class reading, the completion of individual analytical exercises, and the ability/desire to draw using digital and analog media. The class format alternates between lecture and in-class workshop/lab.Course Objectives:- Generate enthusiasm for plants as a design medium
- Establish an essential knowledge base of biotic/abiotic factors in urban planting design
- Develop a design lexicon for the role plants in contemporary landscape architecture and urbanism
- Introduce fundamental technical information for the cultivation of plants in constructed environments
- Cultivate a critical eye and individual design aesthetic
- Introduce process media and representational standards relating to planting designRequired Books & Readings:• Capon, Brian. Botany for gardeners. Timber Press, 2010.

Timesaver Standards for Landscape Architecture by Nicholas Dines and Charles Harris(3) Two hours of lecture and three hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: Environmental Design 11A-11B or consent of instructor. This studio will elaborate on a number of studio themes while introducing the students to a variety of graphic mediums and drawing techniques. Measured drawing procedures (including orthographic projections) will be augmented by figure-ground principles and themes of contrast, color, chiaroscuro, and compositions. On-site and visits to galleries and museums will complement the studio sessions.(3) Two hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Environmental Design 11A-11B or consent of instructor. This course introduces students to digital tools relevant to the discipline of landscape architecture. The course encompasses a series of lectures, lab exercises, and projects designed to equip students with a solid and expandable computing skill base relevant to the learning and practice of landscape architecture. Beyond technical competency, particular emphasis is placed on empowering students to move freely and creatively between software programs as an effective way of representing landscape.Enrolled students who do not attend the first class will be dropped from the course, unless you have contacted the instructor in advance.General dexterity with everyday computing applications is highly recommended: the syllabus assumes that students are generally comfortable using PC’s or Macs and have an ‘everyday’ knowledge of Adobe Photoshop. The course also assumes familiarity with the idea of CAD but prior proficiency is not a prerequisite. No prior ‘rendering’ or ‘modeling’ knowledge is required(3) Two hours of lecture and four hours of studio per week. This course develops freehand drawing as an integral part of the creative process and as an expressive design tool. A broad range of exercises is employed to help students progressively gain creativity, skill, and confidence in their drawing. Various media such as ink, colored pencils, and watercolor are explored as a method to design innovative landscapes. A variety of presentation techniques will be investigated for communicating landscape design. In addition to field sketching, there will be excursions to art galleries, artists' studios, and other creative environments. Through the integration of drawing with intuition and imagination, students will be able to bring their visions to reality.The only media for showing an object in its uniqueness is the visual arts. We ought to talk less and draw more and, like organic nature, communicate everything we have to say in sketches.Drawing is the foundation to creative problem solving and critical thinking, and as such is an integral part of environmental design. LA 135 emphasizes drawing in a wide variety of media to help students realize their full creative potential. The main objective of this studio is to explore the intuitive part of the design process and help individuals express their visions for a sustainable future. Exploration, experimentation and analysis will be encouraged. Drawing promotes a holistic approach to design and empowers one's creativity.This course develops freehand drawing as an integral part of the creative process and as an expressive design tool.

Designed to be a forum for presentation of student research, discussions with faculty researchers and practitioners, and examination of topical issues in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Topics will be announced at the beginning of each semester.In this course, students will explore and develop their understanding of social practice and design, including its history, conceptual and theoretical contributions and possibilities, and its forms of collaborative and engaged practice. Social practice will be viewed as a medium through which students in the College of Environmental Design can 1) challenge the historical divides between communities and public institutions such as universities; 2) envision policy and design solutions that better meet the stated needs of local communities who have long suffered from institutional neglect and structural inequality as it takes place socially and physically; and 3) learn with and from communities in which they might work. We will explore the historical emergence of social practice in its various individual and institutional contexts and practices; examine case studies in different political, social, racial, developmental and environmental contexts; and develop our own sense of the limits and possibilities of socially engaged practice within the contexts of structural and historical inequality in the built and social worlds within which we live and work.While students in this course will develop their community-based research skills and their analytical and written/ visual communication skills, they will do so through the lens of social practice as a possible terrain for challenging inequity and envisioning more socially, racially and environmentally just landscapes and built environments. In this first semester of the course, students will engage in historical, analytical methods as one approach to understanding the longer developmental terrain of a community while also learning how they can develop and utilize tools of engagement in different contexts. We will ask questions such as: how do I enter and get to know a community?What is my own role in engaging residents, local leaders and policy makers? How do I analyze the co-presence of history and spatial materiality as a context within which I will work as a designer and/or policy maker? What are the moments and opportunities for resisting ongoing processes of inequity and how can I partner with residents and elevate different forms of knowing and seeing space in order to counter processes of exclusion, displacement and erasure? In their work, students will be tasked with reflectively engaging in place and with people(3) Three hours of lecture per week. This course surveys the history of American landscape architecture since 1850 in four realms: 1) urban open spaces--that is squares, plazas, parks, and recreation systems; 2) urban and suburban design; 3) regional and environmental planning; 4) gardens. The course will review the cultural and social contexts which have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States since the advent of the public parks movement, as well as, the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes. Students will complete a midterm, final, and a research assignment. Also listed as American Studies C171.This course surveys the history of American landscape architecture since 1850 including the rise of the public parks movement, the development of park systems, the establishment of the national parks, the landscape of the Progressive Era, suburbs, and the modernist landscape.  The survey encompasses urban open spaces, conservation landscapes, urban design, environmental planning, and gardens.  It reviews the economic, cultural and social contexts that have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States, as well as the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes.Prerequisites:None(4) Three hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory per week.

It emphasizes a conceptual appreciation of GIS and offers an opportunity to apply some of those concepts to contemporary geographical and planning issues. Also listed as Geography C188.The course is designed to introduce the student to the rapidly expanding field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  It addresses both theory and application and provides the student with a framework within which spatial problems can be identified and solutions generated. A Geographic information system is not merely an electronic tool kit designed to direct and facilitate the research interests of scientists and planners.   Rather, GIS are a continually evolving, dynamic analytical framework within which data and information are gathered, interpreted, and manipulated, providing the researcher with a comprehensive medium where space, time and information may be integrated.  This course will emphasize a conceptual appreciation of Geographic Information Systems and offer an opportunity to apply some of those concepts to contemporary geographical and planning issues.A clear definition of GIS begins by defining its component terms:The term geographic implies at the very least notions of dealing with the surface of the earth.  A realistic generalization of this term might expand the idea of the earth's surface to include notions of dealing with the concept of space itself.Information is knowledge acquired from facts and data.  These facts and data are characteristics abstracted from phenomena understudy.  Collecting, assembling and integrating these data provides knowledge and intelligence about the phenomena being studied.A system is a method, plan or procedure with operational rules to establish order and assemble a set or arrangement of data.  If the data integration results in knowledge and contains information of a spatial nature, then the system is a GIS.  Although a GIS need not be automated, the contemporary definitions in the literature state or imply the notion of a computer based system.The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) defines GIS as follows: a system, usually computer-based, for the input, storage, retrieval, analysis and display of interpreted geographic data.  The database is typically composed of map-like spatial representations often called coverages or layers.  These layers may involve a three-dimensional matrix of time, location, and attribute or activity.  A GIS may include digital line graph (DLG) data, digital elevation models (DEM), geographic names, land-use characterizations, land ownership, land cover, registered satellite and/or aerial photography along with other associated or derived geographic data.  [FGDC, 1994].Course Structure:The course consists of both a lecture and 'hands-on' laboratory sessions each week.  The lectures will discuss spatial theory, models and decomposition, as well as methods and applications of GIS.  The laboratory sessions will provide a practical introduction to tools used to gather, assemble, encode, analyze and map spatial data. Topics Covered:
* Data discovery; data sources; data gathering; data organization; data management and control.

 (3) Three hours of lecture and lab per week. Through lectures, technical tutorials, and reading discussions, this course will profile contemporary landscape research practices and representational techniques. We will use visualization to advance landscape research, theory, and site analysis, focusing specifically on methods that tackle issues of temporality and ephemerality, and generate original media that communicates spatial, ecological, and cultural complexities.
Naturgemälde, by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland (1803) This course explores the following topics:
(1) Representation as a form of research, both as a tool for conducting it and as an output for its dissemination.
(2) Landscape research that combines scientific explorations with the more humanistic aspects of site analysis and design.
(3) Development of methods of representation and applied techniques for research and communication of landscape design.The course is divided into three units, each exploring a specific representational theme. Units are structured through lectures and discussions about the historical and theoretical relevance of the theme in conjunction with lab sessions focused on demonstrating representational tools and techniques.
 (2-3) Hours to be arranged. Prerequisites: Upper division standing and consent of instructor and sponsor. Grading option: Must be taken on a passed/not passed basis. See departmental information sheet for limitations. Supervised experience relative to specific aspects of landscape architecture. Regular individual meetings with faculty and outside sponsor. Reports required.
 (5) Two hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Formerly Landscape Architecture 101. This studio introduces students to the programmatic, artistic, and technical aspects of land form and topographic adjustments to accommodate human use. Topics include pedestrian and vehicular circulation, conservation and addition of plant materials, movement of water, recreation use, and creation of views. Sculptural land forms will be emphasized through the use of topographic plans, sections, and contour models.Students in this beginning design course are either in the first year of our 3-year design program or the first year of our 2-year Environmental Planning program. Thanks to some recent curriculum changes, this is an experiment intended to strengthen the conceptual and skill-development linkages between insights at the landscape and site scales. We begin by introducing landscapes as biophysical and social realities that we can understand conditionally, both through our senses and through map construction.Next, students are introduced to design by requiring them to propose a linear intervention – the path. Design as a process is introduced as a mix of conceptual, analytical and material engagements, with a focus on the embodied experience of changes in space, time and materials. The larger context of landscape processes is brought into the studio using approximations, expressed as spatial algorithms.EP and 3D students develop responses to the same design assignments until the final four weeks of the term, crossing from 200 scale to 100 scale to 40 scale to 16th scale to 1/8 scale to 1⁄4 scale to 1⁄2 scale drawings. Everyone has the opportunity to work with GIS and CAD tools, as well as Illustrator.(5) Two hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 110, 134A-134B, or consent of instructor. Through lectures, studio problems, research projects, and discussion, this course will explore the challenge and potential incorporating ecological factors in urban contexts. The course focuses on the interaction of landscape science (hydrology, geology, etc.) with the necessities and mechanisms of the human environment (urban design, transportation, economics, etc.). Lectures and research projects will particularly emphasize innovative and forward thinking solutions to the ecological problems of the human environment. Throughout the semester, reading and discussion sessions will highlight the connections between the broader concerns of the global ecological crisis and landscape design and planning.Through lectures, field trips, studio projects, student research, and discussion this course will explore the interrelationship of ecological factors with landscape design and planning in an urban context. The course will focus on the ecological assessment and design of places along the urban, suburban, industrial, agricultural, and rural creek corridors in the Petaluma River watershed, including downtown Petaluma.Students will be encouraged to develop thoughtful, innovative, and responsive urban landscape design solutions to problems uncovered in the corridor as a means of balancing healthy ecosystem function with the built human environment.Lectures will emphasize the importance of understanding basic ecological principles as a basis for design and planning, and will highlight the connections between global ecological crises and landscape design and planning. Students will incorporate ecological knowledge into planning at the regional scale as well as at the site design scale in studio projects. Students will also do independent research on contemporary landscape architectural design projects and report on their relative successes and failures in achieving a sustainable balance of healthy ecosystem function with the designed human environment.Prerequisites:  LD ARCH 110, 134A, 134B – either taken concurrently with this course or waived by consent of instructorIntroduction:This course is entitled “Ecological Factors in Urban Landscape Design”.  The title itself reveals a strong emphasis on creatively synthesizing ecologically-based landscape analysis with landscape design and planning challenges.The studio takes as a starting point the notion that in today’s and tomorrow’s world, ecological factors are of paramount importance in considering the planning, design, and management of the land. Ecological factors include all those influences that bear upon the “ecology” of place, i.e., all interactions among humans and the totality of the environment.  In addition to closely examining fluvial geomorphology, flood hazards, soils, vegetation, hydrology, climate, and fauna, we will also consider infrastructure, energy, transportation, development, land use, wastewater treatment, solid waste, and open space as ecological factors. Implicit in the title and embodied in the course structure is an essential transaction between types of approaches to problem solving directed at resilient long-term processes, not simply designed objects. This course requires both a willingness and ability to blend reasoned, quantitative spatial analysis and three dimensional creative syntheses.  In presenting land analysis, planning and design information to students, the course expects students to be willing to learn across this broad spectrum of activities. In the past, occasionally students have shied away from either the quantitative analysis or the design synthesis tasks as being unfamiliar, uncomfortable, or both. This course seeks an integration of the science behind landscape analysis and planning and the creative spatial and visual thinking required of resolving design projects.(5) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 201, or consent of instructor. A site design studio stressing the shaping and coordination of ideas from initial concept to the thoughtful execution of design ideas at the site scale. Typical projects will focus on the experiential rather than the pictorial. Projects might include a park, plaza, or rehabilitation of a brownfield site.This studio stresses the shaping and development of ideas from initial concept to their execution at the site scale in complex urban environments. The focus is on both the design process itself and the resulting product, with an emphasis on the performance and experiential aspects of composition rather than the pictorial. Each step of the process will be facilitated by specific studio assignments, short lectures, and in-class discussion and exercises.The studio has two primary goals. The first goal is that students approach their work conceptually, strongly anchoring their ideas on the unique characteristics of the project’s site. Instead of solely focusing on solving problems or addressing specific program requirements, the class will design landscapes that embody ideas. Students will be encouraged to experiment, to realize concepts through clear interventions, and to make landscapes that emerge from and celebrate place.The second goal is to pursue the thoughtful execution of ideas – taking concepts beyond collage and sketch models to discover a design’s true physicality. Models and drawings, full scale if need be, will be created to explore materiality, form, scale, proportion, tectonics, and change over time.(5) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 201, or consent of instructor. A site design studio stressing the shaping and coordination of ideas from initial concept to the thoughtful execution of design ideas at the site scale. Typical projects will focus on the experiential rather than the pictorial. Projects might include a park, plaza, or rehabilitation of a brownfield site.The studio will explore how small hybrid urban landscapes associated with community arts institutions can contribute to new languages and expressions for landscapes that are specific to the culture that produces and maintains them.  Issues of place, identity, race, ownership, social and cultural practices, ecology and history are a few topics highlighted.  Three sites in three different US communities will serve as case studies.The Pulitzer Art Foundation, St. Louis MO, hosts a front and back yard lot and street context outside of its Tadao Ando designed inner precinct.  How can the design of the street and adjacent lots add to the museum and civic experience while harnessing the neighborhood’s rich latent and nascent cultural/ ecological history?The August Wilson Home, Pittsburgh PA and Hill District neighborhood, is being restored to create a community arts institution and historic site for one of the most celebrated African American Playwrights of the 20th century.  The recent cinema release “Fences”, starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis highlight this neighborhood and site in its cinematic background.    The movie and subsequent Wilson revival anniversary events have led to the re-imagination of this historic building and landscape site and neighborhood.The Henry J Kaiser Civic Arena, Oakland CA, is restored as Arts, Office and Entrepenurial civic space.  Adorned with seven beautiful Calder niches along its front façade, a new civic porch and public way will host public gatherings, food and dining, and special events…. such as the Warriors Basketball team parade and presentations.MLA and MCP students who are required to take this course towards their degree will be admitted. Non-MLA and MCP will need consent of the instructor to obtain a permission number.(3) Three hours of seminar per week. Prior background in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, restoration, or consent of instructor. Description: This course reviews the underlying goals and assumptions of river and stream restoration projects, reviews techniques employed in these efforts, and emphasizes strategies for evaluation of project success. The course focuses on geomorphic and hydrologic analyses relevant to restoration and enhancement of aquatic and riparian habitat in freshwater systems. Format: lectures by instructor, guest lectures, presentation of student independent projects, and field trips. Course requirement: independent term project involving original research.With the increasing popularity of river and stream restoration in the US and abroad, restoration has attracted supporters and practitioners from a variety of fields.  However, river and stream restoration is not a distinct discipline in itself, but rather involves the application of sound geomorphological, hydrologic, and ecological science to the problem of restoring ecosystem functions to a river system.  The purpose of this course is to explore the field of river and stream restoration, with particular emphasis on geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecological processes essential to the healthy functioning (and thus ecological restoration) of river systems, the role of scientific information in project planning and design, and the post-project evaluation of project performance.  Although this course covers some specific techniques in river restoration, its emphasis is more on the systemic understanding that should underlie restoration planning.  Instruction on specific techniques of bank stabilization, installation of fish habitat structures, etc. are presented in numerous workshops and short courses elsewhere. This course seeks to address the more fundamental issues of whether we should be "restoring" rivers to begin with, and how to restore channel processes that maintain habitat, rather than treating symptoms through approaches such as artificial fish habitat structures and bank stabilization.The class meets once per week, from 6:00-9:30 PM Wednesday evenings..  In many class sessions, professionals active in the field of aquatic and riparian restoration make presentations or participate in discussions.  There is also an intensive field techniques training session and two Saturday field trips, and a river restoration symposium to present term projects.The course is designed to follow on from Ld Arch 222 (Hydrology for Planners), and it assumes a number of concepts and methods from that course (see list of concepts).  If you don’t have this background, the field methods training may be sufficient to fill out your background (consult with instructor).  Requirements: participate in class discussions, write a brief, critical review of a stream restoration plan/proposal, and conduct an independent term project, in most cases a post-project appraisal of a built project.  For the term project, prepare a tight 10-page paper, make a 10-15-minute presentation, and to provide critical peer review comments on another student’s draft paper.  After undergoing two rounds of review and revision, the final paper will be added to the collection of the Water Resources Center Archives.  Past projects: http://www.oac.cdlib.org/cgi-bin/oac/berkeley/wrca(3) 3 hours of instructor presentation of course materials per week, and 6 hours of outside work hours per week.OVERVIEW
Environmental panning intersects with many other disciplines and incorporates a very wide array of sub disciplines. Ranging from city planning, land use planning, landscape architecture, forest management, waste water management, wilderness preservation, urban sustainability and many more. Since there is no single course that can cover all environmental planning issues, this course draws from theory, history, ecological process, policy and real-life projects to construct a critical analysis of the role of environmental planning, its influences and potential impacts. The course will address issues such as environmental justice, urban landscape, global environmental challenges, sustainability of mega projects, threats to environmental resources and contemporary environmental policies. The course complements other Landscape classes in UC Berkeley and enables the student to engage in a critical discussion that will influence their design and planning skills during the university years and beyond.This course will be conducted as seminar with open discussion of the assigned readings
and other course materials. I expect that students will come to class well prepared to
present and respond to discussion questions and ideas about the readings.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar per week. An examination of the roles of the citizens and citizen organizations in the city planning process. Models for citizen involvement ranging from advising to community control. Examination of the effectiveness of different organizational models in different situations. Also listed as City and Regional Planning C261.Involving people in planning and design decisions is an essential part of most planning and design projects in the United States. Good citizen engagement requires application of a specific set of methods and skills. It is a process of both giving information as well as collecting, analyzing and applying information. If done correctly the practitioner gains valuable information that will enhance the outcomes of a project in multiple ways politically, environmentally, socially, aesthetically and/or financially. If done poorly the result can have highly negative consequences. Involving people in a public planning context is different from involving people in site-specific design. The process in each case starts with different objectives and requires different methods. Results are applied in very distinct ways.This class will expose students to the range of both the theory and practice of engaging people in planning and design projects. Students will design and execute a community engagement project with a real organization, critique contemporary participatory planning in the United States and be trained to facilitate a public processThe class will meet once a week for three hours combining a series of lectures, discussions, guest speakers, public meetings, individual and team presentations and exercises. Lectures will draw on the readings, but will not duplicate them. Class time will allow for discussion, teamwork and student/instructor interaction. 
Meets the Graduate Certificate in Global Urban Humanities elective requirement(3) One and one-half hours of seminar and one and one-half hours of discussion per week. Prerequisites: 252A. Students learn research methods including social factors, historical/archival, design exploration, master planning, theoretical, and scientific field work.

We will work together to refine the research topic through writing, editing, discussion and presentations. At the end of the semester, students will submit a complete first draft of their project to their committees.The objectives of this course are the following:Submit a complete a first draft to your committee at the end of the semester(1) One to five hours of seminar per week. Course may be repeated for credit as topic varies. Designed to be a forum for presentation of student research, discussions with faculty researchers and practitioners, and examination of topical issues in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Topics will be announced at the beginning of each semester.(1)One to five hours of seminar per week. Course may be repeated for credit as topic varies. Designed to be a forum for presentation of student research, discussions with faculty researchers and practitioners, and examination of topical issues in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Topics will be announced at the beginning of each semester.LD ARCH 200a and 254 are administratively separate classes, but grading and curriculum for the courses are shared, with LD ARCH 254 designed as support course that provides additional lectures, workshops, and feedback). This course emphasizes the role of studio as a creative and engaging shared venue through which to explore ideas about the designed landscape. You are expected to participate through discussion, image making, modeling, reading, and collaboration with you peers and instructors. You are also encouraged to integrate your diverse backgrounds and experiences into studio. Studio is, however, a unique learning environment with requirements that differ from convention lecture of seminar courses.(1)One to five hours of seminar per week. Course may be repeated for credit as topic varies. Designed to be a forum for presentation of student research, discussions with faculty researchers and practitioners, and examination of topical issues in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Topics will be announced at the beginning of each semester.Cross-listed with Arch 219X Special Topic: Playground Design and the Giant Eye Friday mornings 10-1, room 801 Wurster This seminar establishes the groundwork for a design-build studio in spring 2018 on playground design involving an interactive learning structure. The Giant Eye is a model of the human visual pathway all the way to the brain that children (and adults) can move through in order to experience anatomy three-dimenionally. As a small building, it is also a sculpture, a contribution to the playground landscape, and at any scale it is a playful, engaging learning experience. In the fall 2017 we will visit the site, make some basic decisions regarding scale and materials, review literature on playground theory, and directly experience EyeBody theory as developed by Peter Grunwald, EyeBody. Students who take this seminar do not have to take the studio in the spring, and those who are unable to take the seminar are still eligible to take the studio in the spring, but this seminar will help the studio students be able to produce construction drawings by spring break, so that contruction can proceed on schedule. Learning outcomes: foundations of playground theory, practical experience in site analysis, practical experience in interviewing clients, how the human visual system works.(1) One to five hours of seminar per week. Course may be repeated for credit as topic varies. Designed to be a forum for presentation of student research, discussions with faculty researchers and practitioners, and examination of topical issues in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Topics will be announced at the beginning of each semester.In this course, students will explore and develop their understanding of social practice and design, including its history, conceptual and theoretical contributions and possibilities, and its forms of collaborative and engaged practice. Social practice will be viewed as a medium through which students in the College of Environmental Design can 1) challenge the historical divides between communities and public institutions such as universities; 2) envision policy and design solutions that better meet the stated needs of local communities who have long suffered from institutional neglect and structural inequality as it takes place socially and physically; and 3) learn with and from communities in which they might work. We will explore the historical emergence of social practice in its various individual and institutional contexts and practices; examine case studies in different political, social, racial, developmental and environmental contexts; and develop our own sense of the limits and possibilities of socially engaged practice within the contexts of structural and historical inequality in the built and social worlds within which we live and work.While students in this course will develop their community-based research skills and their analytical and written/ visual communication skills, they will do so through the lens of social practice as a possible terrain for challenging inequity and envisioning more socially, racially and environmentally just landscapes and built environments. In this first semester of the course, students will engage in historical, analytical methods as one approach to understanding the longer developmental terrain of a community while also learning how they can develop and utilize tools of engagement in different contexts. We will ask questions such as: how do I enter and get to know a community?What is my own role in engaging residents, local leaders and policy makers? How do I analyze the co-presence of history and spatial materiality as a context within which I will work as a designer and/or policy maker? What are the moments and opportunities for resisting ongoing processes of inequity and how can I partner with residents and elevate different forms of knowing and seeing space in order to counter processes of exclusion, displacement and erasure? In their work, students will be tasked with reflectively engaging in place and with people(1) Course may be repeated for credit. Course meets every other week.

Prerequisites: Environmental Design 11A-11B or consent of instructor. This studio introduces students to the programmatic, artistic, and technical aspects of land form and topographic adjustments to accommodate human use. Topics include pedestrian and vehicular circulation, conservation and addition of plant materials, movement of water, recreation use, and creation of views. Sculptural land forms will be emphasized through the use of topographic plans, sections, and contour models.This course, through a studio format, introduces the concepts, principles and techniques required to design landscapes. The studio is a hands-on experience where students will produce drawings, models and other artifacts to convey their design solutions for the projects assigned.In the first year landscape architectural studio sequence, it is our intention that students begin to learn to manipulate the three key formal elements available to the landscape designer - the land (topography), architectural form (walls, pavements, small structural objects and furnishings) and vegetation.Although the projects in this studio will require some experimentation with all three, we will concentrate primarily on the skills required to manipulate topography. (5) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 101, 102, Environmental Design 11A-11B, (Arch 100A or 100B for Architecture students) or by consent of instructor. This is an undergraduate studio with a central focus on climate modification for energy conservation. We will research historical precedents in order to develop new garden forms for passive green designs. We will also explore how past cultures integrated metaphysics into their gardens as an adjunct to microclimate and habitat design. The contemporary landscape should be a balanced interweaving of proportion, function, comfort, energy conservation, and enlightenment. Additionally, we will study the choreography of space and investigate how to animate the landscape through the creative interpretation of text and film. Many new and exciting opportunities lie ahead for the creation of garden forms that not only conserve energy, but are also works of art and places of spiritual renewal.(4) Three hours of lecture per week. Analysis of environmental factors, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem dynamics, as related to decision-making for landscape planning and design.Ecological analysis is concerned with developing an understanding of natural factors of the environment. How these factors relate to one another and how they must be considered in landscape design and land use planning are primary concerns of the course. Eight factors will be considered: topography, geology, climate, soil, hydrology, flora, vegetation and fauna. The interactions of these factors in ecosystems will also be explored along with the basic concepts of landscape ecology.The lecture formats will be used to present the material. Lectures are scheduled Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8:00 AM in room 315A Wurster Hall.Grading will be based on laboratory reports (100 points), homework problems (100 points), one mid-term examination (200 points), a laboratory final (100 points), and a final examination (400 points).  Letter grades will be assigned on a percentage basis (90 to 100% = A; 80 to 89% = B; 70 to 79% = C; 60 to 69% = D; <60% = F).The required readings for LA 110 are collected in a reader, which is available from a local copy service (Copy Central on Bancroft Avenue). The reader is also on reserve in the Environmental Design Library. Numerous maps, tables, and diagrams are used in the lectures. These have been put together in "An Illustrated Outline of Ecological Analysis" which is also available from a Copy Central.(2) Four hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Landscape Architecture 110 (may be taken concurrently). Introduction to field techniques for assessment of landscape factors. Factors include topography, geology, climate, soil, hydrology, flora, vegetation, and wildlife.(3) Three hours of lecture per week. Through lecture, research, and studio assignments, this course introduces the use of plants as design elements in the landscape, from the urban scale to the site-specific scale, focusing on the public open space. By analyzing historic, contemporary, and Bay Area examples, the course examines the spatial, visual, and sensory qualities of vegetation, as well as the interplay with ecological functions and engineering uses of plants.This course focuses on urban planting design as a technological and aesthetic practice rooted in natural and cultural precedent. Coursework and readings will emphasize the dynamic role of plants in cities and the inherent complexity of designing with a living medium.  Weekly lectures, practicums, and analytical exercises will synthesize subjects covered in the course and provide students with an intellectual framework, reliable methodology, and contemporary skillset to approach planting design in urbanized areas. The course requires extensive out of class reading, the completion of individual analytical exercises, and the ability/desire to draw using digital and analog media. The class format alternates between lecture and in-class workshop/lab.Course Objectives:- Generate enthusiasm for plants as a design medium

Prerequisites: Environmental Design 11A-11B or consent of instructor. This studio will elaborate on a number of studio themes while introducing the students to a variety of graphic mediums and drawing techniques. Measured drawing procedures (including orthographic projections) will be augmented by figure-ground principles and themes of contrast, color, chiaroscuro, and compositions. On-site and visits to galleries and museums will complement the studio sessions.(3) Two hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Environmental Design 11A-11B or consent of instructor. This course introduces students to digital tools relevant to the discipline of landscape architecture. The course encompasses a series of lectures, lab exercises, and projects designed to equip students with a solid and expandable computing skill base relevant to the learning and practice of landscape architecture. Beyond technical competency, particular emphasis is placed on empowering students to move freely and creatively between software programs as an effective way of representing landscape.Enrolled students who do not attend the first class will be dropped from the course, unless you have contacted the instructor in advance.General dexterity with everyday computing applications is highly recommended: the syllabus assumes that students are generally comfortable using PC’s or Macs and have an ‘everyday’ knowledge of Adobe Photoshop. The course also assumes familiarity with the idea of CAD but prior proficiency is not a prerequisite. No prior ‘rendering’ or ‘modeling’ knowledge is required(3) Two hours of lecture and four hours of studio per week. This course develops freehand drawing as an integral part of the creative process and as an expressive design tool. A broad range of exercises is employed to help students progressively gain creativity, skill, and confidence in their drawing. Various media such as ink, colored pencils, and watercolor are explored as a method to design innovative landscapes. A variety of presentation techniques will be investigated for communicating landscape design. In addition to field sketching, there will be excursions to art galleries, artists' studios, and other creative environments. Through the integration of drawing with intuition and imagination, students will be able to bring their visions to reality.The only media for showing an object in its uniqueness is the visual arts. We ought to talk less and draw more and, like organic nature, communicate everything we have to say in sketches.Drawing is the foundation to creative problem solving and critical thinking, and as such is an integral part of environmental design. LA 135 emphasizes drawing in a wide variety of media to help students realize their full creative potential. The main objective of this studio is to explore the intuitive part of the design process and help individuals express their visions for a sustainable future. Exploration, experimentation and analysis will be encouraged. Drawing promotes a holistic approach to design and empowers one's creativity.This course develops freehand drawing as an integral part of the creative process and as an expressive design tool.

Designed to be a forum for presentation of student research, discussions with faculty researchers and practitioners, and examination of topical issues in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Topics will be announced at the beginning of each semester.In this course, students will explore and develop their understanding of social practice and design, including its history, conceptual and theoretical contributions and possibilities, and its forms of collaborative and engaged practice. Social practice will be viewed as a medium through which students in the College of Environmental Design can 1) challenge the historical divides between communities and public institutions such as universities; 2) envision policy and design solutions that better meet the stated needs of local communities who have long suffered from institutional neglect and structural inequality as it takes place socially and physically; and 3) learn with and from communities in which they might work. We will explore the historical emergence of social practice in its various individual and institutional contexts and practices; examine case studies in different political, social, racial, developmental and environmental contexts; and develop our own sense of the limits and possibilities of socially engaged practice within the contexts of structural and historical inequality in the built and social worlds within which we live and work.While students in this course will develop their community-based research skills and their analytical and written/ visual communication skills, they will do so through the lens of social practice as a possible terrain for challenging inequity and envisioning more socially, racially and environmentally just landscapes and built environments. In this first semester of the course, students will engage in historical, analytical methods as one approach to understanding the longer developmental terrain of a community while also learning how they can develop and utilize tools of engagement in different contexts. We will ask questions such as: how do I enter and get to know a community?What is my own role in engaging residents, local leaders and policy makers? How do I analyze the co-presence of history and spatial materiality as a context within which I will work as a designer and/or policy maker? What are the moments and opportunities for resisting ongoing processes of inequity and how can I partner with residents and elevate different forms of knowing and seeing space in order to counter processes of exclusion, displacement and erasure? In their work, students will be tasked with reflectively engaging in place and with people(3) Three hours of lecture per week. This course surveys the history of American landscape architecture since 1850 in four realms: 1) urban open spaces--that is squares, plazas, parks, and recreation systems; 2) urban and suburban design; 3) regional and environmental planning; 4) gardens. The course will review the cultural and social contexts which have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States since the advent of the public parks movement, as well as, the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes. Students will complete a midterm, final, and a research assignment. Also listed as American Studies C171.This course surveys the history of American landscape architecture since 1850 including the rise of the public parks movement, the development of park systems, the establishment of the national parks, the landscape of the Progressive Era, suburbs, and the modernist landscape.  The survey encompasses urban open spaces, conservation landscapes, urban design, environmental planning, and gardens.  It reviews the economic, cultural and social contexts that have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States, as well as the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes.Prerequisites:None(4) Three hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Some computer experience. Formerly C188X. This course introduces the student to the rapidly expanding field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It addresses both theory and application and provides the student with a dynamic analytical framework within which temporal and spatial data and information is gathered, integrated, interpreted, and manipulated. It emphasizes a conceptual appreciation of GIS and offers an opportunity to apply some of those concepts to contemporary geographical and planning issues. Also listed as Geography C188.The course is designed to introduce the student to the rapidly expanding field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  It addresses both theory and application and provides the student with a framework within which spatial problems can be identified and solutions generated. A Geographic information system is not merely an electronic tool kit designed to direct and facilitate the research interests of scientists and planners.   Rather, GIS are a continually evolving, dynamic analytical framework within which data and information are gathered, interpreted, and manipulated, providing the researcher with a comprehensive medium where space, time and information may be integrated.  This course will emphasize a conceptual appreciation of Geographic Information Systems and offer an opportunity to apply some of those concepts to contemporary geographical and planning issues.A clear definition of GIS begins by defining its component terms:The term geographic implies at the very least notions of dealing with the surface of the earth.  A realistic generalization of this term might expand the idea of the earth's surface to include notions of dealing with the concept of space itself.Information is knowledge acquired from facts and data.  These facts and data are characteristics abstracted from phenomena understudy.  Collecting, assembling and integrating these data provides knowledge and intelligence about the phenomena being studied.A system is a method, plan or procedure with operational rules to establish order and assemble a set or arrangement of data.  If the data integration results in knowledge and contains information of a spatial nature, then the system is a GIS.  Although a GIS need not be automated, the contemporary definitions in the literature state or imply the notion of a computer based system.The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) defines GIS as follows: a system, usually computer-based, for the input, storage, retrieval, analysis and display of interpreted geographic data.  The database is typically composed of map-like spatial representations often called coverages or layers.  These layers may involve a three-dimensional matrix of time, location, and attribute or activity.  A GIS may include digital line graph (DLG) data, digital elevation models (DEM), geographic names, land-use characterizations, land ownership, land cover, registered satellite and/or aerial photography along with other associated or derived geographic data.  [FGDC, 1994].Course Structure:The course consists of both a lecture and 'hands-on' laboratory sessions each week.  The lectures will discuss spatial theory, models and decomposition, as well as methods and applications of GIS.  The laboratory sessions will provide a practical introduction to tools used to gather, assemble, encode, analyze and map spatial data. Topics Covered:
* Data discovery; data sources; data gathering; data organization; data management and control.
* Information, systems and space; spatial sampling; spatial and non-spatial data structures; spatial dimension encoded as points, lines and polygons; scale; spatial characterization and association.
* Database and project design; data gathering; database construction; geo-positioning; global positioning systems (GPS); map projections; digitizing existing published maps; spatial data formats; spatial data standards; data translation; data quality, precision and accuracy; boundary and data error.
* Remote sensing; classification analysis; ancillary data.
* Data dictionaries, meta data and standards.
* Spatial operations; measurement; classification; polygon overlay; disaggregation and dissolve.
* Spatial analysis; modeling techniques and landscape characterization.

 (3) Three hours of lecture and lab per week. Through lectures, technical tutorials, and reading discussions, this course will profile contemporary landscape research practices and representational techniques. We will use visualization to advance landscape research, theory, and site analysis, focusing specifically on methods that tackle issues of temporality and ephemerality, and generate original media that communicates spatial, ecological, and cultural complexities.
Naturgemälde, by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland (1803) This course explores the following topics:
(1) Representation as a form of research, both as a tool for conducting it and as an output for its dissemination.
(2) Landscape research that combines scientific explorations with the more humanistic aspects of site analysis and design.
(3) Development of methods of representation and applied techniques for research and communication of landscape design.The course is divided into three units, each exploring a specific representational theme. Units are structured through lectures and discussions about the historical and theoretical relevance of the theme in conjunction with lab sessions focused on demonstrating representational tools and techniques.
 (2-3) Hours to be arranged. Prerequisites: Upper division standing and consent of instructor and sponsor. Grading option: Must be taken on a passed/not passed basis. See departmental information sheet for limitations. Supervised experience relative to specific aspects of landscape architecture. Regular individual meetings with faculty and outside sponsor. Reports required.
 (5) Two hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Formerly Landscape Architecture 101. This studio introduces students to the programmatic, artistic, and technical aspects of land form and topographic adjustments to accommodate human use. Topics include pedestrian and vehicular circulation, conservation and addition of plant materials, movement of water, recreation use, and creation of views. Sculptural land forms will be emphasized through the use of topographic plans, sections, and contour models.Students in this beginning design course are either in the first year of our 3-year design program or the first year of our 2-year Environmental Planning program. Thanks to some recent curriculum changes, this is an experiment intended to strengthen the conceptual and skill-development linkages between insights at the landscape and site scales. We begin by introducing landscapes as biophysical and social realities that we can understand conditionally, both through our senses and through map construction.Next, students are introduced to design by requiring them to propose a linear intervention – the path. Design as a process is introduced as a mix of conceptual, analytical and material engagements, with a focus on the embodied experience of changes in space, time and materials. The larger context of landscape processes is brought into the studio using approximations, expressed as spatial algorithms.EP and 3D students develop responses to the same design assignments until the final four weeks of the term, crossing from 200 scale to 100 scale to 40 scale to 16th scale to 1/8 scale to 1⁄4 scale to 1⁄2 scale drawings. Everyone has the opportunity to work with GIS and CAD tools, as well as Illustrator.(5) Two hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 110, 134A-134B, or consent of instructor. Through lectures, studio problems, research projects, and discussion, this course will explore the challenge and potential incorporating ecological factors in urban contexts. The course focuses on the interaction of landscape science (hydrology, geology, etc.) with the necessities and mechanisms of the human environment (urban design, transportation, economics, etc.). Lectures and research projects will particularly emphasize innovative and forward thinking solutions to the ecological problems of the human environment. Throughout the semester, reading and discussion sessions will highlight the connections between the broader concerns of the global ecological crisis and landscape design and planning.Through lectures, field trips, studio projects, student research, and discussion this course will explore the interrelationship of ecological factors with landscape design and planning in an urban context. The course will focus on the ecological assessment and design of places along the urban, suburban, industrial, agricultural, and rural creek corridors in the Petaluma River watershed, including downtown Petaluma.Students will be encouraged to develop thoughtful, innovative, and responsive urban landscape design solutions to problems uncovered in the corridor as a means of balancing healthy ecosystem function with the built human environment.Lectures will emphasize the importance of understanding basic ecological principles as a basis for design and planning, and will highlight the connections between global ecological crises and landscape design and planning. Students will incorporate ecological knowledge into planning at the regional scale as well as at the site design scale in studio projects. Students will also do independent research on contemporary landscape architectural design projects and report on their relative successes and failures in achieving a sustainable balance of healthy ecosystem function with the designed human environment.Prerequisites:  LD ARCH 110, 134A, 134B – either taken concurrently with this course or waived by consent of instructorIntroduction:This course is entitled “Ecological Factors in Urban Landscape Design”.  The title itself reveals a strong emphasis on creatively synthesizing ecologically-based landscape analysis with landscape design and planning challenges.The studio takes as a starting point the notion that in today’s and tomorrow’s world, ecological factors are of paramount importance in considering the planning, design, and management of the land. Ecological factors include all those influences that bear upon the “ecology” of place, i.e., all interactions among humans and the totality of the environment.  In addition to closely examining fluvial geomorphology, flood hazards, soils, vegetation, hydrology, climate, and fauna, we will also consider infrastructure, energy, transportation, development, land use, wastewater treatment, solid waste, and open space as ecological factors. Implicit in the title and embodied in the course structure is an essential transaction between types of approaches to problem solving directed at resilient long-term processes, not simply designed objects. This course requires both a willingness and ability to blend reasoned, quantitative spatial analysis and three dimensional creative syntheses.  In presenting land analysis, planning and design information to students, the course expects students to be willing to learn across this broad spectrum of activities. In the past, occasionally students have shied away from either the quantitative analysis or the design synthesis tasks as being unfamiliar, uncomfortable, or both. This course seeks an integration of the science behind landscape analysis and planning and the creative spatial and visual thinking required of resolving design projects.(5) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 201, or consent of instructor. A site design studio stressing the shaping and coordination of ideas from initial concept to the thoughtful execution of design ideas at the site scale. Typical projects will focus on the experiential rather than the pictorial. Projects might include a park, plaza, or rehabilitation of a brownfield site.This studio stresses the shaping and development of ideas from initial concept to their execution at the site scale in complex urban environments. The focus is on both the design process itself and the resulting product, with an emphasis on the performance and experiential aspects of composition rather than the pictorial. Each step of the process will be facilitated by specific studio assignments, short lectures, and in-class discussion and exercises.The studio has two primary goals. The first goal is that students approach their work conceptually, strongly anchoring their ideas on the unique characteristics of the project’s site. Instead of solely focusing on solving problems or addressing specific program requirements, the class will design landscapes that embody ideas. Students will be encouraged to experiment, to realize concepts through clear interventions, and to make landscapes that emerge from and celebrate place.The second goal is to pursue the thoughtful execution of ideas – taking concepts beyond collage and sketch models to discover a design’s true physicality. Models and drawings, full scale if need be, will be created to explore materiality, form, scale, proportion, tectonics, and change over time.(5) Three hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: 201, or consent of instructor. A site design studio stressing the shaping and coordination of ideas from initial concept to the thoughtful execution of design ideas at the site scale. Typical projects will focus on the experiential rather than the pictorial. Projects might include a park, plaza, or rehabilitation of a brownfield site.The studio will explore how small hybrid urban landscapes associated with community arts institutions can contribute to new languages and expressions for landscapes that are specific to the culture that produces and maintains them.  Issues of place, identity, race, ownership, social and cultural practices, ecology and history are a few topics highlighted.  Three sites in three different US communities will serve as case studies.The Pulitzer Art Foundation, St. Louis MO, hosts a front and back yard lot and street context outside of its Tadao Ando designed inner precinct.  How can the design of the street and adjacent lots add to the museum and civic experience while harnessing the neighborhood’s rich latent and nascent cultural/ ecological history?The August Wilson Home, Pittsburgh PA and Hill District neighborhood, is being restored to create a community arts institution and historic site for one of the most celebrated African American Playwrights of the 20th century.  The recent cinema release “Fences”, starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis highlight this neighborhood and site in its cinematic background.    The movie and subsequent Wilson revival anniversary events have led to the re-imagination of this historic building and landscape site and neighborhood.The Henry J Kaiser Civic Arena, Oakland CA, is restored as Arts, Office and Entrepenurial civic space.  Adorned with seven beautiful Calder niches along its front façade, a new civic porch and public way will host public gatherings, food and dining, and special events…. such as the Warriors Basketball team parade and presentations.MLA and MCP students who are required to take this course towards their degree will be admitted. Non-MLA and MCP will need consent of the instructor to obtain a permission number.(3) Three hours of seminar per week. Prior background in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, restoration, or consent of instructor. Description: This course reviews the underlying goals and assumptions of river and stream restoration projects, reviews techniques employed in these efforts, and emphasizes strategies for evaluation of project success. The course focuses on geomorphic and hydrologic analyses relevant to restoration and enhancement of aquatic and riparian habitat in freshwater systems. Format: lectures by instructor, guest lectures, presentation of student independent projects, and field trips. Course requirement: independent term project involving original research.With the increasing popularity of river and stream restoration in the US and abroad, restoration has attracted supporters and practitioners from a variety of fields.  However, river and stream restoration is not a distinct discipline in itself, but rather involves the application of sound geomorphological, hydrologic, and ecological science to the problem of restoring ecosystem functions to a river system.  The purpose of this course is to explore the field of river and stream restoration, with particular emphasis on geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecological processes essential to the healthy functioning (and thus ecological restoration) of river systems, the role of scientific information in project planning and design, and the post-project evaluation of project performance.  Although this course covers some specific techniques in river restoration, its emphasis is more on the systemic understanding that should underlie restoration planning.  Instruction on specific techniques of bank stabilization, installation of fish habitat structures, etc. are presented in numerous workshops and short courses elsewhere. This course seeks to address the more fundamental issues of whether we should be "restoring" rivers to begin with, and how to restore channel processes that maintain habitat, rather than treating symptoms through approaches such as artificial fish habitat structures and bank stabilization.The class meets once per week, from 6:00-9:30 PM Wednesday evenings..  In many class sessions, professionals active in the field of aquatic and riparian restoration make presentations or participate in discussions.  There is also an intensive field techniques training session and two Saturday field trips, and a river restoration symposium to present term projects.The course is designed to follow on from Ld Arch 222 (Hydrology for Planners), and it assumes a number of concepts and methods from that course (see list of concepts).  If you don’t have this background, the field methods training may be sufficient to fill out your background (consult with instructor).  Requirements: participate in class discussions, write a brief, critical review of a stream restoration plan/proposal, and conduct an independent term project, in most cases a post-project appraisal of a built project.  For the term project, prepare a tight 10-page paper, make a 10-15-minute presentation, and to provide critical peer review comments on another student’s draft paper.  After undergoing two rounds of review and revision, the final paper will be added to the collection of the Water Resources Center Archives.  Past projects: http://www.oac.cdlib.org/cgi-bin/oac/berkeley/wrca(3) 3 hours of instructor presentation of course materials per week, and 6 hours of outside work hours per week.OVERVIEW
Environmental panning intersects with many other disciplines and incorporates a very wide array of sub disciplines. Ranging from city planning, land use planning, landscape architecture, forest management, waste water management, wilderness preservation, urban sustainability and many more. Since there is no single course that can cover all environmental planning issues, this course draws from theory, history, ecological process, policy and real-life projects to construct a critical analysis of the role of environmental planning, its influences and potential impacts. The course will address issues such as environmental justice, urban landscape, global environmental challenges, sustainability of mega projects, threats to environmental resources and contemporary environmental policies. The course complements other Landscape classes in UC Berkeley and enables the student to engage in a critical discussion that will influence their design and planning skills during the university years and beyond.This course will be conducted as seminar with open discussion of the assigned readings
and other course materials. I expect that students will come to class well prepared to
present and respond to discussion questions and ideas about the readings.(3) Three hours of lecture/seminar per week. An examination of the roles of the citizens and citizen organizations in the city planning process. Models for citizen involvement ranging from advising to community control. Examination of the effectiveness of different organizational models in different situations. Also listed as City and Regional Planning C261.Involving people in planning and design decisions is an essential part of most planning and design projects in the United States. Good citizen engagement requires application of a specific set of methods and skills. It is a process of both giving information as well as collecting, analyzing and applying information. If done correctly the practitioner gains valuable information that will enhance the outcomes of a project in multiple ways politically, environmentally, socially, aesthetically and/or financially. If done poorly the result can have highly negative consequences. Involving people in a public planning context is different from involving people in site-specific design. The process in each case starts with different objectives and requires different methods. Results are applied in very distinct ways.This class will expose students to the range of both the theory and practice of engaging people in planning and design projects. Students will design and execute a community engagement project with a real organization, critique contemporary participatory planning in the United States and be trained to facilitate a public processThe class will meet once a week for three hours combining a series of lectures, discussions, guest speakers, public meetings, individual and team presentations and exercises. Lectures will draw on the readings, but will not duplicate them. Class time will allow for discussion, teamwork and student/instructor interaction. 
Meets the Graduate Certificate in Global Urban Humanities elective requirement(3) One and one-half hours of seminar and one and one-half hours of discussion per week. Prerequisites: 252A.

The Giant Eye is a model of the human visual pathway all the way to the brain that children (and adults) can move through in order to experience anatomy three-dimenionally. As a small building, it is also a sculpture, a contribution to the playground landscape, and at any scale it is a playful, engaging learning experience. In the fall 2017 we will visit the site, make some basic decisions regarding scale and materials, review literature on playground theory, and directly experience EyeBody theory as developed by Peter Grunwald, EyeBody. Students who take this seminar do not have to take the studio in the spring, and those who are unable to take the seminar are still eligible to take the studio in the spring, but this seminar will help the studio students be able to produce construction drawings by spring break, so that contruction can proceed on schedule. Learning outcomes: foundations of playground theory, practical experience in site analysis, practical experience in interviewing clients, how the human visual system works.(1) One to five hours of seminar per week. Course may be repeated for credit as topic varies.

	The Undergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI) is a campuswide initiative to support departments in establishing educational goals and evaluation procedures for all undergraduate programs. As a result of the initiative, faculty and students have a shared understanding of the purpose of the major and what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study. The initiative is in keeping with the fundamental principle at Berkeley that the evaluation of student achievement should be locally defined, discipline specific, and faculty-driven.
	The statements below represent the pedagogy of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning:
	These statements are made operational by skills and abilities common to the theory and practice of landscape architecture that our undergraduate students are expected to acquire:
	Additionally, it is our philosophy that our students be compelled to bring their creative talent to the public landscape. As such we teach them how to be part of democratic decision-making at all levels. Further, we hope our students will self-actualize through their educational process while being grounded in theory, methods (including field), construction craft, and studio design.

	The Master of Landscape Architecture with an emphasis in environmental planning is a two-year program for students with a strong background in the environmental sciences or management, or undergraduate degrees in landscape architecture, urban studies, planning, or design. The degree program curriculum requires 55 units.
	Environmental planning is the application of natural and social science to promote environmentally sound development and management of natural resources. It is a broad field, bridging the disciplines of geology, soils, hydrology, plant and wildlife ecology, law, and public policy. Many environmental planners are also specialists in these fields; what distinguishes them as planners is that they bring analytical, managerial, and policy-making skills to bear on decisions about the appropriate use of land and natural resources.
	Underlying the process is the philosophy that better land-use decisions will result if the decision makers are better informed about the environmental effects of alternative actions. Thus, the environmental planner pulls information together from various disciplines and presents it in a form comprehensible to decision makers. This involves working closely with specialists in interactions that draw upon the planner’s background in these specializations.
	The role of environmental planners has increased with mandates for environmental impact assessment at local, state, federal, and international levels. In these studies, the planner plays a pivotal role: providing a bridge between specialists and the decision makers. Similarly, restoration of degraded land and streams, an area of increasing interest, requires the skills of the environmental planner to ensure that the planning and design of restoration projects take ecological processes and constraints into account.
	At the regional planning scale, environmental planners analyze the landscape to identify constraints on land use. From these analyses, guidelines and regulations are developed to reduce losses from landslides, earthquakes, floods, forest fires, and other natural hazards. Other goals are to maintain clean streams and groundwater supplies, to prevent erosion of soil or loss of agricultural lands to development, to maintain wildlife habitats, to retain significant scenic resources, and to enhance recreational resources.
	At the site planning scale, environmental planners are called upon to create or review specific development proposals, acting as intermediaries between natural scientists and planning agencies. In this role, the traditional skills of the landscape architect in physical planning and site design are used to inspire more creative and ecologically informed plans and to help mitigate the detrimental effects of development.
	Environmental planners work in a variety of professional settings, including the U.S. Forest Service, Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, state and regional agencies responsible for management of natural resources and protection of sensitive areas (e.g., the coastal zone). Some are employed in firms that undertake large-scale analyses and plans for public agencies, and the design of privately financed development projects. Others work with international development agencies or nongovernmental organizations concerned with preservation of environmental values.

	One of several areas of specialization within the field of landscape architecture is urban design. Beginning in the 19th century, landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted and John Nolan demonstrated the special contributions the field of landscape architecture could make to a city’s quality. The tradition continues today.
	Landscape architects contribute to urban design by understanding the natural features of the landscape and producing urban form that contributes to both regional and local identity. Urban landscape designers also must consider the perceptions and values of urban inhabitants and often engage users actively in the creation of plans. Large-scale urban systems such as streets and highways, parks, water edges, and utility systems are all in urgent need of visionary design, as are residential areas in declining inner neighborhoods and new peripheral developments.
	In addition to having a solid grounding in the basics of landscape design, landscape architecture students interested in urban design should take a course in history and theory of urban form (CY PLAN 240), techniques for measuring and evaluating urban settings (LD ARCH C241), and urban design studios (LD ARCH 203, CY PLAN 248, and others). Courses in land use and other regulatory techniques, land or public economics, infrastructure, and citizen involvement in planning are recommended. Students who desire to pursue an urban design focus should discuss their curriculum with Professors Bosselmann or Hood.
	The synthesis and application of ecology and physical science into the traditional practice of landscape architecture can inspire new landscape vocabulary and contribute to the creation of ecologically sustainable built landscapes. Within the urban and rural public landscape, opportunities for the integration of infrastructure and natural systems can promote healthier environments for humans and natural habitats. Areas of specialization may include vegetation management, riparian restoration, urban forestry, and resource conservation and management. Faculty: Kondolf, McBride, Radke.

Over its long history, IURD has sponsored research in numerous disciplines. Principal research areas involve creating inclusive cities, urban governance, healthy cities, place and mobility, understanding city science, and urban environment. In all of its research projects, IURD emphasizes interdisciplinary and cooperative study. As the first school to combine the disciplines of architecture, planning, and landscape architecture into a single college, CED was also among the first to conceptualize environmental design as inseparable from its social, political-economic, and cultural contexts. Across all three departments, CED’s faculty research local and global challenges with this unique concept of environmental design in mind. One of the premier architecture, landscape architecture, and city and regional planning libraries in North America, the Environmental Design Library includes more than 210,000 volumes and subscriptions, as well as thousands of electronic resources from around the world used to support the teaching and research programs of the College of Environmental Design. CED’s library contains a myriad of department specific collections, rare and limited edition books and original reproductions, as well as reference and research services provided by CED’s friendly and knowledgeable librarians.  The Environmental Design Archives holds more than 200 collections documenting the built and landscaped environment. These records span more than a century, 1890-2014, and contain primary source materials such as correspondence, reports, specifications, drawings, photographs, models, and artifacts. The Archives holds records of not only California’s early important architects, but also contemporary and lesser-known architects and designers from around the world.  The Visual Resources center is a library of teaching and research images, with over 82,000 digital images, over 300,000 35mm slides, and 37,000 lantern slides depicting architecture, landscapes, cities, and related material. In addition to the Center’s extensive collection of images, it also provides services that help faculty and students create digital images for classroom use, create digital images from slides or archival material, and to create digital version of 35mm slides and Lantern slides in the Center’s collection for teaching use.  The Cal Design Lab at Wurster Hall is an experimental studio space that promotes hands-on, interdisciplinary design activities. Faculty and students from UC Berkeley’s many schools and departments come together at the Cal Design Lab to work on critical design challenges. The goal of the lab is to be a nexus for design research and practice, and to facilitate discourse that transcends different design disciplines. The lab offers formal space for transdisciplinary seminars and projects, as well as informal space for student teams to work and interact with design coaches or mentors.  The College of Environmental Design offers several introductory summer programs for those interested in exploring the fields of architecture, landscape architecture and environmental planning, urban design and sustainable city planning. CED also offers workshops in the basics of fabrication as well as techniques and technologies that push the boundaries of making.POST-BACCALAUREATE. The Summer [IN]STITUTE consists of [IN]ARCH, [IN]LAND and [IN]CITY, three introductory programs in architecture, landscape architecture and city planning for post-baccalaureate students or senior-level undergraduates, and [IN]ARCH ADV, an advanced studio for students who have an undergraduate degree in architecture or who are senior-level architecture majors. Participants in the Summer [IN]STITUTE explore the methods and theories of the fields, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to top faculty and practitioners, and build a portfolio for graduate school application.

September 15 - December 15, 2017The annual College of Environmental Design Career Fair brings together wide ranging employers and design firms to meet and recruit UC Berkeley students in the disciplines of architecture, planning, urban studies and other environmental design fields.“Register now for ULI San Francisco’s one-day summit: Housing the Bay! Join us as we explore potential solutions to the housing supply and affordability crisis in the Bay Area.”“Our urban communities face synchronous challenges that traditional educational programs often aren’t prepared to address. I applaud the College of Environmental Design at UC Berkeley for creating the Masters of Real Estate Development and Design (MRED+D). Now more than ever we need a holistic approach to design, development and land economics. The Berkeley program is a brilliant orchestration of the very people, pedagogies and practices required to teach a new generation the skills we’ll need to solve the urban issues of today and tomorrow.”Graduates of the MRED+D program may not don hard hats too often, but nothing is more thrilling than walking through a construction project whose completion will meet users’ needs while providing a legacy of financial performance and design excellence that makes the community a better place. The diverse career options for graduates allow them to contribute to our society, economy, and planet – whether by starting new, innovative companies, financing net-positive real estate projects, designing climate resilient developments, or helping cities craft more inclusive and affordable neighborhoods. An MRED+D degree opens the door to a host of exciting career opportunities. Our goal is to prepare graduates with professional education and training but also expand their vision for the future. That vision can include becoming an entrepreneur and starting a new firm, joining a start-up or established company, working in government, or serving a nonprofit organization that addresses urban challenges or seeks, improve quality of urban life, or protect the planet.The MRED+D program readies its graduates for major careers in real estate development and related fields. The CED Office of Career Services and the Program’s Career Services Officer provide a wide range of resources tailored to MRED+D students. These include up-to-the-minute listings of internships, competitions, and employment opportunities, career counseling, career development workshops and industry panels, student-mentor mixers, career fairs, and recruiting events. In addition, the Berkeley Real Estate Club provides a chance to meet a wide range of other graduate students interested in real estate, and offers a variety of professional development opportunities including the Accelerated Careers in Real Estate (ACRE) program.MRED+D students also benefit from the program’s respected Affiliated Professionals, experienced industry experts who play a vital role in course instruction. These industry leaders utilize the case method to teach students about real work development examples, enable students to understand the complexities of development practice, and provide connections to the broader professional community. Affilates also participate in the MRED+D program as guest lecturers, studio critics, and competition mentors. These professional help build a wide network for students and help them launch their careers.  Sather Gate, UC Berkeley“We need academic programs where real estate professionals can learn how to think about, measure and promote positive community impacts while insuring that investors and developers can still meet their financial objectives.  The MRED+D program will serve as a laboratory for testing policies and approaches that will help its graduates think about real estate in a different way.” Applicants are required to follow UC Berkeley Graduate Council and Graduate Division requirements including having a bachelor’s degree from an acceptable institution, a minimum 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale, and a minimum TOEFL/IELTS score (if applicable). Applicants are also expected to submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), include at least 3 Letters of Recommendation in their application package, and have a first professional degree and/or relevant professional experience.In addition, working knowledge of Excel spreadsheet modeling and basic financial accounting among incoming students is expected. Incoming students without such preparation will need to complete technical skill preparation courses, which are offered online at a variety of universities, for example Harvard Business School. Those students requiring such technical courses will need to demonstrate successful completion before classes commence.The MRED+D Program Fee Schedule is listed on the Berkeley Graduate Division’s site on Tuition Costs and Fees. Fees cover University of California tuition and graduate professional student fees, and provide access to university and college resources, including computing labs, printing/plotting, etc.  In addition, the fee covers costs associated with students travel to the national Urban Land Institute Annual Fall Meeting.Applicants may be eligible for fellowship support.

It should also convey how a combination of life experiences, idealism, role models, education and work experiences have influenced your decision to apply, as well as how any teaching, research, and professional or public service contributions you have made have promoted diversity and equal opportunity. For tips on writing a Personal History Statement, please see the Personal Statement Guide on the UC Berkeley Graduate Division website.While this is not a requirement, we strongly encourage students to submit images of work, writing samples, and/or past projects for consideration. We only accept online letters of recommendation. We will accept letters sent from a university letter service.No, the graduate programs do not have a deferral option.Unofficial notifications of acceptance are emailed to applicants by March 1, 2018, and applicants who have been recommended for admission are notified by the UC Berkeley Graduate Division soon thereafter. Only the written notice of the Dean of the Graduate Division of UC Berkeley constitutes approval of admission. Correspondence with faculty or staff of the College of Environmental Design, no matter what the content, will not commit the University to an approval of admission.Examination Questions:Exam scores are only valid for five years. We cannot accept old scores. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required (see Required Application Materials — Examinations) and you must have your official score reported to the UC Berkeley Graduate Division by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). There is no minimum score requirement. Note: Register for the GRE early, and choose a date that will allow your score report to arrive on time for admissions review.UC Berkeley School Code: 4833Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must demonstrate English-language proficiency by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination. The TOEFL is the preferred language proficiency test for the MRED+D program; Minimum required scores are 570 for the paper-based test, 230 for the computer-based test, and at least 90 for the internet-based test (iBT). Minimum required IELTS score is a 7 on a 9-point scale.UC Berkeley School Code: 4833Foreign applicants who have baccalaureate degrees from educational institutions at which instruction was in English must take the GRE rather than the TOEFL. Contact the UC Berkeley Graduate Admissions Office with any questions.The University requires a minimum grade-point average (GPA) of 3.0, B, or equivalent. You may use our GPA calculator to determine your GPA. Note to students who attended a U.S. institution: GPA calculations are based on coursework taken after the first two years of undergraduate study.

	There is no minimum required score for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). GRE test scores are good for five years. The minimum required scores for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) are 570 for the paper-based test, 230 for the computer-based test, and 90 for the iBT (internet-based test). For Fall 2015, tests taken before June 1, 2013 will not be accepted even if your score was reported to Berkeley. Please note that test scores are just one component of review when deciding admissions.Your GRE scores and undergraduate GPA constitute only a part of your application. These measures alone do not give the admissions committee a clear picture of you as an applicant. It is most important that you therefore take the time to draft an excellent Statement of Purpose that allows the committee to get to know you and your goals, and that you select your recommenders carefully.GMAT scores will be reviewed. LSAT and MCAT scores will not. The GRE is preferred.The MRED+D Program:We expect to enroll between up to 20 students for the inaugural MRED+D class.Students are not able to place out of a core course. Transfer credit is not accepted.The MRED+D program is a full-time on-campus program. You can expect to dedicate full-time to the program during the 6-week summer term with a rigorous load of classwork.  During the fall and spring terms, you can expect 12 hours of in-class time per week and a minimum of 24 hours per week of work outside the classroom. In the case of a semester that includes a studio, you should anticipate more hours in class since studio courses involve 8 hours/week of on-site studio work.Absolutely. Because students will come from varied educational backgrounds and have a range of work experience, programs can be tailored to place more emphasis on finance, law, and other technical aspects of real estate transactions, for example, or provide more in-depth training on aspects of design, housing, or international urban development. In addition, the student’s Capstone project during the spring semester offers an opportunity to address a real estate problem of the student’s own preference.Concurrent degree programs have not been developed for the MRED+D. We will be considering this possibility over the coming year.Work Experience + Previous Education: Students in the MRED+D program come from diverse backgrounds with a range of different levels of experience in the real estate field and in related industries such as architecture, construction, commercial real estate finance, law, city planning, and commercial real estate brokerage.  While you do not need an undergraduate degree in a specific field to apply to our professional master's degree program, you must have earned your bachelor's degree at an accredited university. Undergraduate degrees may be either BA/BS degrees or 5-year professional undergraduate degrees. Applicants with undergraduate degrees in the following fields of are strongly encouraged to apply:The MRED+D curriculum is designed to build upon your work experience.  As such, we look closely at your career progression and level when making an admissions decision. Generally we expect a minimum of 3 years of work experience. We also consider the combination of education, training, and work experience together and also how closely related your educational background and experience is to the MRED+D program.  Students are expected to have working knowledge of Excel spreadsheet modeling and basic financial accounting before they enter the program. If you do not have this background, it can be obtained through online courses offered by a variety of universities. This must be completed prior to the start of the program. In order to insure breadth of knowledge of the built environment, there are 3 courses required for the MRED+D that are offered by these CED professional graduate programs. You are also welcome to take electives from the approved electives list, some of which are offered by other CED programs (as well as other UC Berkeley academic units). Because students will have varied backgrounds, the Faculty Director will work with you individually to curate your programs of study to minimize duplication and meet student-specific needs. The MRED+D faculty includes both College of Environmental Design professors and professors of practice including some of the most widely recognized real estate and urban development professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area. These leading professionals are chosen specifically for their ability to effectively teach to fellow professionals.The CED Career Services Office provides a wide variety of services for MRED+D students including, but not limited to: individual coaching, job listings and job search services, resume posting, career fairs and networking events, career management workshops and webinars. MRED+D students are also encouraged to join the Berkeley Real Estate Club, a group including students from the Haas School of Business, Berkeley Law, and the College of Environmental Design, that focuses on career development and opportunities.There are clear distinctions between MBA programs, traditional Real Estate programs and the MRED+D. If you are interested in focusing on real estate finance, marketing, accounting, quantitative methods, or the real estate sector in general, an MBA with a Real Estate emphasis/concentration, or a Real Estate degree, may be the right choice for you. If you are looking to gain a holistic view of how real estate development functions in the larger urban context and you are interesting in equity, sustainability, and design principles as well as real estate finance, law, and the development process, the MRED+D will be a good choice. The degree program seeks to educate and embolden such interdisciplinary professionals. International Students:Yes. If you are an international student and apply no later than our posted February application deadline, your application will be reviewed and considered for admission. If an offer of admission is extended, then UC Berkeley will assist you in obtaining a student visa.No. Every applicant, regardless of citizenship, is required to submit the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and supplemental admissions materials.Financial Aid + Fellowships:There is no separate application for program merit-based fellowships. In addition to completion of the appropriate fellowships section of the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application, submission of the required application components will automatically qualify you for fellowship eligibility. If awarded a departmental fellowship, you will be notified in your program admission offer.Three types of fellowships are offered to MRED+D students:It is beneficial for applicants to seek financial support that is independent of university sources.
	If you are an international student, look for fellowships from your home country or through international agencies.The University of California, Berkeley participates in the William D. Ford Federal Loan Program, which allows students enrolled at least half-time (6 units) to borrow money directly from the federal government at a fixed interest rate.NOTE: In order to receive fellowship support through the University, applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents must apply for need-based financial aid, which requires the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans are non-need based loans. The annual limit is $20,500 per academic year. All students who meet general eligibility requirements may qualify for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Interest accrues at disbursement on the portion that is disbursed. The interest that accrues is not compounded or capitalized during periods of enrollment; the accrued interest is capitalized just prior to entering repayment.Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loans are non-need based loans. Grad PLUS Loans are credit-based loans which require a credit check. To be eligible for a Grad PLUS loan you must meet the other general eligibility requirements for the Federal Student Aid Programs, and must not have an adverse credit history (i.e. no more than 90 days late on any debt, no bankruptcies or tax liens within the past 5 years, and no defaults or adverse actions on any prior education debt). Students can borrow a Grad PLUS Loan up to the remaining total Cost of Attendance each year, minus any other expected financial aid. The definition of "adverse credit" for the Grad PLUS Loan is defined in detail on the FAQ section of the FSA (Federal Student Aid) website.MRED+D students can apply semester-long positions as Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) positions. GSI and GSR positions are announced each semester, and incoming students are eligible to apply for these positions as well.Please see the below special instructions for the MRED+D program as they pertain to the general UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application:  You may choose up to 3 faculty advisers that you wish to work with, but at least 1 faculty adviser is required.The GRE is required for the MRED+D; you may also submit the GMAT to supplement your appilcaiton.

Any aspiring real estate professional would be doing themselves a disservice to learn the business in a vacuum. Whether you work on the development, asset management, legal, financing, construction or design side of the industry, you will interact with members of all of those professions on a daily basis. Learning the language, priorities, and concerns of those groups as a student has helped me be a more successful professional in my field. Berkeley's new MRED+D program provides an interdisciplinary approach to the study of real estate development and I would have applied to the MRED+D had it been available."With its longstanding educational leadership in the key disciplines of MAKING the built environment – architecture, landscape architecture, and city planning – and its deep commitments to socially and ecologically sustainable development, the CED is uniquely positioned to offer this fantastic new MRED+D program.  And with the rest of UC Berkeley at your doorstep – what could be better?  If I were 30 years younger I’d apply!”
The development of urban real estate is one of the most powerful forces shaping our buildings, cities, and metropolitan regions.  From finance to design, the choices we make about what to build, where to build, and how to build influence urban sustainability, equity, and resilience – today and for years to come.Our rapidly urbanizing world faces major challenges, ranging from climate change to social inequality. We need real estate professionals who have a deep knowledge of how development can bring positive benefits to society and the environment, and who understand the power of design to make cities efficient, livable, distinctive, and valued.The Master of Real Estate Development + Design (MRED+D) is an 11 month interdisciplinary degree program incorporating finance and innovative design to prepare real estate development professionals to build sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities.The MRED+D covers the fundamentals of real estate markets, finance, urban economics, property and land use law, project feasibility analysis, and the details of the urban development process. But we include ‘design’ in the degree’s name for a reason. The MRED+D program goes beyond tradition, to link real estate to the world of design based on two convictions. One is that successful real estate development requires excellence in urban design, planning, and sustainability. The other is that design thinking – the iterative process of problem finding, prototyping solutions, and iterative critique – is fundamental to producing the most valued and valuable real estate projects.Program graduates enjoy a dual edge, offering employers and clients, expertise in real estate finance and development along with a knowledge base in design and the built environment. Alumni of Berkeley’s MRED+D program are excellent candidates for careers in:The Berkeley MRED+D offers an exceptional value proposition:Join us in creating a 21st century real estate profession, whose practitioners can structure innovative financial deals, imagine new building and community typologies, and help future cities grow fairly and sustainably!The UC Berkeley MRED+D Program is housed in the College of Environmental Design (CED). The college is an interdisciplinary hub of undergraduate, professional, and doctoral programs focused on the built environment, creating powerful synergies and opportunities for collaboration. Under one roof, students are exposed to a wide range of ideas from adjacent fields, and work on teams with planners and designers – excellent preparation for the real world of real estate development, where team work is the norm.The college is located in Wurster Hall, which houses the MRED+D program’s classrooms, seminar rooms, and studios, and administrative offices and the Office of Career Services.  In addition, Wurster Hall offers a beautiful library, computer labs, gallery, and lively café. If you have a degree in fields such as architecture, city planning, landscape architecture, urban studies, business, law, public policy, or engineering, please apply! Note that undergraduate degrees may be either BA/BS degrees or 5-year professional undergraduate degrees. The program welcomes applicants from other fields who have a desire to pursue a career in real estate development. The ideal candidate will also have experience in professional practice.We welcome students from diverse backgrounds, with a diverse array of education, training, and professional experience.

			Sustainability Development Policy Director at SPUR  The Global Cities/Global Challenges Seminar addresses some of the most pressing challenges global cities are facing today. Through a series of lectures on the past, present and future of urban regions across five continents, we will discuss the many wicked problems cities are tackling. The seminar will also expose students to a series of success stories, showing how conditions can change for the better through the agency of environmental design.The Urban Innovation Seminar provides a framework for discussing and contextualizing studio work. Every week, students engage in lively discussions ignited by brief presentations delivered by the Program Directors. To prepare for every session, students are assigned readings and writings on the selected topics.The Urban Innovation Semiar is comprised of three modules: Place, People and Prototypes.Place focuses on an understanding of the urban environment as a complex system of economic, ecological and social patterns in constant flux. People examines the forces at play in the shaping of the urban environment's patterns, paying special attention to those that have impacted the most vulnerable groups.Prototypes looks at design as a catalyst to make our cities more just, livable and resilient. 
 The purpose of Disc* Fieldwork is two-fold. On the one hand, students deepen their understanding of the urban process by exploring sites that epitomize the most relevant challenges of urbanization. On the other, students are granted direct access to some of the places where innovative urban solutions are conceived and fabricated. Guided by Bay Area urbanists, students visit a variety of sites, ranging from future regional infrastructure hubs to epicenters of gentrification and social exclusion, to enclaves of wildness and biodiversity in the city. "The field trips were essential! I really appreciate the multiple layers of urban design we were exposed to." -Disc*2016 alumJohn Bela

As you wander through campus you’ll be surrounded by historically significant Beaux Art classical and collegiate gothic-style buildings designed by John Galen Howard as well as structures by Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles Moore and Joseph Esherick. There is a wonder of things to see, explore and experience at Berkeley. The campus is home to 32 libraries — in 2008, the Association of Research Libraries ranked the UC Berkeley's University Library as the No. 1 public research university library in the country. Berkeley hosts numerous museums and galleries, including seven natural history museums; the Berkeley Art Museum, which houses diverse collections of more than 13,000 objects; and the Pacific Film Archive, which includes 10,000 films.Photo: David SchmitzRenowned for its natural beauty, entrepreneurialism, rich history and diversity, there is no better place to study, learn and have fun than the San Francisco Bay area.NATURAL BEAUTY: From the dense urban landscapes of downtown San Francisco to the open spaces of the Oakland Hills and the spectacular San Francisco Bay, the Bay Area offers incredible opportunities to explore and be inspired. We are surrounded by hills, mountains and the Pacific Ocean. The Bay Area has a special beauty found nowhere else in the world. The temperate climate and geographic diversity guarantee that there will be something fun to do outside the classroom year round, whether it's hiking in Muir Woods and the East Bay Regional Parks, kayaking in the Bay, snowboarding in Tahoe, or skating in Golden Gate Park.Photo: Steve McConnell, UC Berkeley ENTREPRENEURIALISM: The vibrant and diverse culture in the Bay Area fuels innovation — we are home to many of the industry leaders in technology such as Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, and Apple — making it one of the most exciting places in the country to live and work.HISTORY: The rich history of the Bay area, and its booming enterprise, are evidenced in our many outstanding examples of architecture, urban planning, and landscape design. Examples by Frederick Law Olmsted, Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Thomas Church, Jack Kent, William Wurster, Harwell H. Harris, Robert Royston, Charles Moore, Peter Walker, Joseph Eichler, Allan Jacobs, Peter Calthorpe, Renzo Piano, Thom Mayne, Herzog & de Meuron, and Snöhetta, are only a small handful of the iconic designers and planners who have left their mark here. It’s no surprise that many world class architecture and landscape design firms have chosen to make their home in the Bay Area.DIVERSITY: Anywhere you go in the Bay Area, there’s a community vibe that immediately makes you feel welcome. With Berkeley at its core, there truly is no better place to design your future.The College of Environmental Design (CED) has been at the forefront of environmental design education since our founding in 1959. We were the first to combine architecture, planning, and landscape architecture into a single college. All of our programs are designed to guide students toward the creation of sustainable and beautiful buildings, environments, and communities based on sound ethical, social, and ecological principles. We need to view the fragility of the planet and its resources as an opportunity for speculative design innovations rather than as a form for technical legitimation for promoting conventional solutions. By extension, the problems confronting our cities and regions would then become opportunities to define a new approach.

Mohsen Mostafavi, Ecological UrbanismThe studio environment is at the core of the Disc* program. While all components of the program are vital and interconnected, it can be said that all roads lead back to the studio. This is where you can put the knowledge that you have gained from the lectures, seminars, workshops, and fieldwork to use in developing your design work.The goal of the studio is to learn theory and skills to analyze a complex urban environment, assess needs through research and mapping, develop an informed design proposal, and creative effective representation utilizing computer software and digital fabrication methods.
  The GIS workshops expose students to the fundamentals of digital Geographic Information System mapping, gaining knowledge that directly informs studio work. In the workshops, students georeference historical maps and visualize data sets geospatially in order to create new thematic maps. Through these exercises, they not only learn the basics of the software, but also further their understanding of the environmental and cultural history of the sites they are exploring, gaining specific knowledge of historical ecology, land use, urban morphology, infrastructure and mobility patterns.
 The Rhino workshops demonstrate 2D drafting techniques and digital 3D, rendering with the VRay plug-in, graphic exporting, and digital fabrication file processing. The workshop focuses on digital drawing and modeling to develop urban design scenarios, in addition to exporting 2D graphics for Adobe software and presentations and creating perspective renderings with VRay.
 The Adobe workshop includes instruction with Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. The workshop links the workflow from Rhino 2D graphic exports, digital rendering, and generally focuses on creating high quality presentation materials from design work. Photoshop includes instruction on rendering techniques. Illustrator is used primarily to create 2D vector graphics. InDesign is used for Presentation Board layouts.The Digital Fabrication workshop demonstrates techniques for additive and subtractive manufacturing. Students use Rhino software to create 2D and 3D files for fabrication of parts for the studio project. This includes the use of 3D printing and laser cutting. In the process, students learn to materialize digital designs into physical artifacts. Disc* students are given a work desk in the studio space and have access to Wurster Hall's computer labs, Digital Fabrication Lab and Environmental Design Library, as well as to scheduled events, exhibits, lectures and symposiums at the college. Various other facilities and resources across the UC Berkeley campus - such as the RSF gym, Health & Welness Center, meal plans, other campus libraries, student discounts, and so on - are also available to Disc* students.Access to the Digital Fabrication Lab is arranged through Disc* instructors in consultation with lab staff.

In their words: "We farm, feed, forage, teach, train, build community, employ, and give back."The 2016 embARC Design Build project - overseen by CED Fabrication Shop Mechanicians Tonia Sing Chi and Elizabeth Thorp - donated a storage shelter and rainwater catchment system to the Verde Elementary School Partnership Garden, a hub of the North Richmond community upon which a range of local residents depend for fresh food. The structures incorporated sustainable materials into a contemporary form, giving embARC students a real-world example of the necessity of environmental responsibility in all aspects of the design and fabrication process.Each year, embARC's Design Build project is linked to the Sustainable Planning Workshop and the Architecture & Design studio with the aim of presenting the study and practice of environmental design as an interwoven, interdependent and interdisciplinary field.For more information, visit Urban Tilth's website.We would like to extend our appreciation to John Voekel, Principal Engineer at Framework Engineering, for generously donating his time and energy to ensuring the structural integrity of the Design Build project.   embARC 2015 took on the Golden Gate chapter of the Audubon Society, located on San Pablo Avenue in Berkeley, as their community partner and Design Build client. In consultation with Anthony DeCicco, the Golden Gate Audubon Society's youth education director, and UC Berkeley Fabrication Shop staff Semar Prom, Elizabeth Thorp and Paul Mirocha, embARC students produced a number of designs that met the needs of local endangered bird populations.Three of the boxes will be permanently installed in Blake Garden, the College of Environmental Design's "landscape laboratory" in the hills of Kensington, under the watchful eye of Garden Manager Laurie Twitchell. The rest of the boxes fabricated by the students will be donated to the Golden Gate Audubon Society and the Raptor Observatory, located near Hawk Hill in Marin County, where volunteers will monitor and record data about avian visitors.According to their mission statement, "The Golden Gate Audubon Society engages people to experience the wonder of birds, and translate that wonder into action in order to protect native bird populations and their habitats." The embARC team would like to thank GGAS for being such engaged, inspiring partners for the summer of 2015. In 2014, embARC partnered with Spiral Gardens, a non-profit food security project, to design and build a chicken coop for the local Berkeley community. The mission of Spiral Gardens is to create healthy sustainable communities by promoting a strong local food system and encouraging productive use of urban soil. The students designed housing complexes and built models of their ideas in CED’s fabrication shop and digital fabrication lab, both in Wurster Hall. Students were led by CED instructor Matt Wolpe, a fabrication shop mechanician who runs his own Design-build company and has co-authored a book on designing chicken coops. With the embARC students' contribution, a small clutch of hens (plus a few ducks and turkey chicks) are now nesting comfortably in a new redwood four-plex in southwest Berkeley. The mission of Spiral Gardens is to “create healthy sustainable communities by promoting a strong local food system and encouraging productive use of urban soil.” Please note: these deadlines are specific to embARC and vary from those listed on the Summer Sessions website.

It was a true learning experience when it came to turning design into reality. This class challenged me to use design thinking in order to really fulfill the everyday needs that people face with sustainable solutions."Isabel L., embARC Alumna Students experience what it is like to work on their own design projects in a studio environment. With a locally-based project, they have the opportunity to make first-hand observations of the area through numerous guided site visits, which help inform their individual design proposals. Instruction on freehand sketching, drafting, model building and digital representation teach students how to conceptualize and communicate two and three-dimensional design ideas. On-site observations are supplemented with research in the historic, cultural, political and economic conditions of a project site. The studio culminates in a final design review where students exhibit, present, and discuss their work with CED faculty, graduate students, and alumni. Students engage as genuine stakeholders and participants in a community change process by developing solutions to an authentic urban planning question. Through a series of lectures and group exercises, they learn about current state and local policies and share ideas for helping cities and regions create attractive, healthy and sustainable communities for all. The students also take inspiring visits to sites that are nationally recognized models of sustainable urban development to gain a better understanding of the story of "place" and community-building. At Berkeley, our faculty and students participate in real-world issues, challenging current thinking and working to design a better future.

As you wander through campus you’ll be surrounded by historically significant Beaux Art classical and collegiate gothic-style buildings designed by John Galen Howard as well as structures by Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles Moore and Joseph Esherick. There is a wonder of things to see, explore and experience at Berkeley. The campus is home to 32 libraries — in 2008, the Association of Research Libraries ranked the UC Berkeley's University Library as the No. 1 public research university library in the country. Berkeley hosts numerous museums and galleries, including seven natural history museums; the Berkeley Art Museum, which houses diverse collections of more than 13,000 objects; and the Pacific Film Archive, which includes 10,000 films.Photo: David SchmitzRenowned for its natural beauty, entrepreneurialism, rich history and diversity, there is no better place to study, learn and have fun than the San Francisco Bay area.NATURAL BEAUTY: From the dense urban landscapes of downtown San Francisco to the open spaces of the Oakland Hills and the spectacular San Francisco Bay, the Bay Area offers incredible opportunities to explore and be inspired. We are surrounded by hills, mountains and the Pacific Ocean. The Bay Area has a special beauty found nowhere else in the world. The temperate climate and geographic diversity guarantee that there will be something fun to do outside the classroom year round, whether it's hiking in Muir Woods and the East Bay Regional Parks, kayaking in the Bay, snowboarding in Tahoe, or skating in Golden Gate Park.Photo: Steve McConnell, UC Berkeley ENTREPRENEURIALISM: The vibrant and diverse culture in the Bay Area fuels innovation — we are home to many of the industry leaders in technology such as Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, and Apple — making it one of the most exciting places in the country to live and work.HISTORY: The rich history of the Bay area, and its booming enterprise, are evidenced in our many outstanding examples of architecture, urban planning, and landscape design. Examples by Frederick Law Olmsted, Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Thomas Church, Jack Kent, William Wurster, Harwell H. Harris, Robert Royston, Charles Moore, Peter Walker, Joseph Eichler, Allan Jacobs, Peter Calthorpe, Renzo Piano, Thom Mayne, Herzog & de Meuron, and Snöhetta, are only a small handful of the iconic designers and planners who have left their mark here. It’s no surprise that many world class architecture and landscape design firms have chosen to make their home in the Bay Area.DIVERSITY: Anywhere you go in the Bay Area, there’s a community vibe that immediately makes you feel welcome. With Berkeley at its core, there truly is no better place to design your future.The College of Environmental Design (CED) has been at the forefront of environmental design education since our founding in 1959. We were the first to combine architecture, planning, and landscape architecture into a single college. All of our programs are designed to guide students toward the creation of sustainable and beautiful buildings, environments, and communities based on sound ethical, social, and ecological principles. Looking for fun and challenging design/build opportunities? CED's Fabrication Shop and Digital Fabrication Lab offers Maker Workshops that allow you to explore methods of woodworking, metalworking and digital fabrication in a low-pressure atmosphere with the guidance of expert makers. The Summer Institute, offered by the College of Environmental Design (CED) at UC Berkeley, consists of four cohorts:an introductory program in architecture for post-baccalaureate students with no previous experience in environmental design.an advanced program in architecture for students who are in their final year of an undergraduate architecture program, or have already earned an undergraduate degree in architecture.an introductory program in sustainable city planning for post-baccalaureate students with no previous experience in environmental design.an introductory program in landscape architecture for post-baccalaureate students with no previous experience in environmental design. Summer Institute students explore the methods and theories of the fields, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to faculty and practitioners, and build a portfolio for graduate school application.Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, a seminar or media course, and site visits. After fulfilling the program requirements, participants receive a certificate of completion and an official UC Berkeley transcript. All classes are held in Wurster Hall, CED's home on the UC Berkeley campus.The Summer Institute was a life-changing experience. I would have never learned as much as I did without this course, met the people I met, and overall feel as inspired as I do. Not only do I have so many amazing things to add to my portfolio and my resume, but I've made friends and a great network."This program helped to reassure me that I can take my passion for social and environmental issues and have a successful and satisfying career in planning. It also gave me the confidence and experience needed to apply and get accepted into grad school."Please fill out the form below and someone from the Summer Programs Office will be in touch. The Summer Institute, offered by the College of Environmental Design (CED) at UC Berkeley, consists of four cohorts:an introductory program in architecture for post-baccalaureate students with no previous experience in environmental design.an advanced program in architecture for students who are in their final year of an undergraduate architecture program, or have already earned an undergraduate degree in architecture.an introductory program in sustainable city planning for post-baccalaureate students with no previous experience in environmental design.an introductory program in landscape architecture for post-baccalaureate students with no previous experience in environmental design. Summer Institute students explore the methods and theories of the fields, experience the culture of design and planning studios, connect to faculty and practitioners, and build a portfolio for graduate school application.Each program includes a lecture series, a design or planning studio, a seminar or media course, and site visits.

By attending daily lectures and engaging in studio work, participants acquire the skills necessary to inform planning proposals. [IN]CITY assignments are real projects with actual clients who represent a diverse group of stakeholder organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area. These organizations actively aim to influence sustainable planning policy at the local, county and regional levels.[IN]CITY students develop in-depth recommendations, analyses and proposals for these client projects, which run the gamut of planning practice: housing and design, bike mobility and transportation, public health and environmental justice, community development and gentrification, urban design, climate action and art in public spaces. In doing so, participants have an opportunity to influence planning in the Bay Area by exploring institutional, political, social, economic and environmental policy challenges. [IN]CITY is geared towards post-baccalaureate students who are considering graduate study in city and regional planning. No previous planning or design experience is necessary to be eligible."[IN]CITY was a fun and challenging experience! I learned valuable skills and information that enhanced my ability to change career paths from green building to community and economic development planning in a surprisingly short amount of time."The daily seminar offers an overview of sustainability issues related to several different areas in sustainable urbanism including community development, housing, land use, transportation, urban design and water. Internationally-renowned faculty from CED’s Department of City and Regional Planning provide engaging lectures and discussions around these topics. During the seminar, students also participate in site visits and tours of cutting-edge projects and programs, and meet with the local officials involved.[IN]CITY's Planning Studio is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience. Past clients include the City of Berkeley, City of Oakland, Kala Institute, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, among others. Instructors with many years of experience in sustainability planning teach the studio. The studio products are designed for students to explore key policy challenges (institutional, political, social, economic, environmental, among others) and to develop tangible design and planning strategies.To develop these strategies, students conduct data analysis related to demographics, land use, and transportation; learn city and street design and drawing techniques; and critically evaluate complex and sometimes contentious real-world policy and planning options. A key aspect of [IN]CITY is the practice of oral presentation skills through ongoing pin-ups, reviews, desk crits and presentations. These skills are crucial for a successful career in planning, where much time is spent communicating with non-technical audiences and working in multi-disciplinary teams.Thank you for a great summer. I’m at the school I strived for, thanks to the [IN]CITY program. *Please note: students often dedicate evenings and weekends to Institute projects 
Eric Anderson is a City Planner and University of California instructor with 17 years of public agency, consulting, non-profit, and public university experience. Anderson has been involved with the [IN]CITY program since 2010 and joined the faculty as an instructor in 2013. He has lectured on sustainable transportation and Complete Streets policy, planning, and design in UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design's Department of City and Regional Planning; has taught at the graduate level in the UC Davis Transportation, Technology, and Policy program; and has spoken at conferences and led workshops across the U.S. and Canada. His professional work includes the City of Berkeley, Alta Planning + Design, the Marin County Bicycle Coalition, and the City of Chicago. Anderson’s first paid job in sustainable transport was delivering a paper route on foot and by bicycle at age 11.Drawing on his background as both a practicing city planner and UC instructor, Anderson challenges students to integrate scholarship with their own lived experience, creating a collaborative experiential learning environment. Ultimately, the goal of this process is to empower each student to work as part of a successful team and deliver theoretically grounded, yet eminently actionable recommendations to improve our communities. His teaching focuses on urban design as a sustainable, resilient “Complete Streets” response to the pressing challenges of climate change and transportation equity. He encourages students to explore structural inequality through public health, public safety, and accessibility, as part of an effort to interrogate the causes and effects of privilege across the disciplines of city planning.

 [IN]CITY is a comprehensive six week introduction to the study and practice of urban planning through the lens of sustainability. By attending daily lectures and engaging in studio work, participants acquire the skills necessary to inform planning proposals. [IN]CITY assignments are real projects with actual clients who represent a diverse group of stakeholder organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area. These organizations actively aim to influence sustainable planning policy at the local, county and regional levels.[IN]CITY students develop in-depth recommendations, analyses and proposals for these client projects, which run the gamut of planning practice: housing and design, bike mobility and transportation, public health and environmental justice, community development and gentrification, urban design, climate action and art in public spaces. In doing so, participants have an opportunity to influence planning in the Bay Area by exploring institutional, political, social, economic and environmental policy challenges. [IN]CITY is geared towards post-baccalaureate students who are considering graduate study in city and regional planning. No previous planning or design experience is necessary to be eligible."[IN]CITY was a fun and challenging experience! I learned valuable skills and information that enhanced my ability to change career paths from green building to community and economic development planning in a surprisingly short amount of time."The daily seminar offers an overview of sustainability issues related to several different areas in sustainable urbanism including community development, housing, land use, transportation, urban design and water. Internationally-renowned faculty from CED’s Department of City and Regional Planning provide engaging lectures and discussions around these topics. During the seminar, students also participate in site visits and tours of cutting-edge projects and programs, and meet with the local officials involved.[IN]CITY's Planning Studio is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience.

According to WHO, "The urban population in 2014 accounted for 54% of the total global population. It is estimated that by 2017, a majority of people will be living in urban areas." Cities worldwide are struggling with problems of managing this rapid growth. Urban design professionals of the future will have a huge impact on infrastructure, land use patterns and the reuse of existing sites and more.The College of Environmental Design offers urban design concentrations both as degree and concurrent degree programs. The Master of Urban Design degree program is a one-year, advanced, interdisciplinary program of study for students with a prior professional degree in architecture, landscape architecture, or city and regional planning. The program's goals are to further train designers who are able to work effectively in teams across a large range of scales and who have a well-developed understanding of urban places and the interdependencies of the fabric of buildings, landscapes, public ways, and the social interactions that shape them.Faculty from all three departments are engaged in urban design research, teaching, and professional practice.

Students share working methods, acquire additional skills, and explore new avenues of development under the supervision of an interdisciplinary group of faculty members in the College of Environmental Design drawn from the Departments of Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning, and City and Regional Planning. In addition to the program’s core curriculum, Urban Design students can construct a trans-disciplinary course of study with studios, lectures and seminar courses from all three departments in the college.The program addresses the need for professionals who are specifically concerned with the design of varied urban areas open to public use. The activities of urban design are diverse in both type and scale; it may be concerned with settlement patterns in urbanizing areas, city or town layout, the restructuring of inner cities , the metropolitan edge—mega-cities, territorial dispersed settlements or conversely the planning of cities decreasing in population.  Studies may lead to the design of infrastructure such as highways, streets, bicycle, pedestrian trails and open spaces, buildings, and landscape patterns that establish neighborhoods and provide the settings for public life. Alternatively the program may work on infill in older towns and cities, or may prepare plans, guidelines, or standards to manage extensive new development at the metropolitan growth edge. Our platform incorporates ecological concerns including the understanding of watersheds, topography, conservation or creation of green areas, the need for the preservation of energy resources and a good equitable and varied quality of life for present and future generations.UC Berkeley is located in one of the most diverse urban areas of the country featuring a varied urban field that contains the traditional fabric of the older areas of San Francisco, Silicon Valley as well as generations of diverse suburban/urban neighborhoods. The Master of Urban Design program at U.C. Berkeley is focused on California the most populous and most diverse states in the US but sees the rest of country and the world as vital source of knowledge. To that objective the program organizes yearly workshops in Asia, Europe or Latin America and assigns travel grants to students on a competitive basis to study places worldwide that relate to their thesis.Five courses constitute the core of the Master of Urban Design degree program:An additional studio is selected from one of the graduate studios in the three departments. As advanced candidates, MUD students are expected to take a leadership role in these studios, assisting with the preparation, conduct, or evaluation of the studio and relating it to the content of the Master of Urban Design program. Students must also complete a course that offers instruction in methods for urban design practice or research; a course in urban design history or theory; and elective courses related to the thesis topic and selected in consultation with MUD faculty.

It cracked my mind open and put me back in touch with the real reasons why I entered the design profession. It was life changing. The knowledge gained from Berkeley along with the networks established have become the new benchmark for current and future projects I am involved with.The Program is well structured with a good balance of academic and practical teaching and knowledge sharing. The ability to guide your own learning within the thesis and studio is a major advantage.The MUD program opened my eyes to the urban challenges that are facing cities throughout the world and provided me with the knowledge, experience, skills and confidence to contribute to city urban solutions. The program was the catalyst for the establishment of my own practice, City Collective, which is based on the holistic design approaches and responses to city scale problems addressed within the MUD program.“ Hometown Ningbo, China

My professional career has been largely focused on master planning and design projects for institutional campuses. I believe that campuses are concentrated, city-like places built around shared aspirations, identity, and values. The comprehensive viewpoint that I learned in the MUD program has allowed me to approach my work with a whole systems thinking - rooting design in the fundamentals of culture and place. The program also expanded my worldview, exposing me to people, places, and ideas that strengthened my understanding and appreciation of the profession. Both the faculty and my fellow colleagues all pushed me during the program, helping to refine my work and supporting my personal and professional development.

Thesis: The housing / landscape interface: Turning backs to fronts in the Castilla Neighborhood, Kennedy District, Bogota.“Berkeley has influenced my career strongly, giving me a very holistic perspective of our global urban futures. Specifically, the Urban Design Program, being a hybrid in between Planning, Landscape and Architecture makes it very unique, covering a very wide range of topics across disciplines. Additionally, studying in the Bay Area is interesting because of its variety of cities, geographical and economic conditions.”Hometown: Cairo, Egypt
Thesis: Returning Civility to Egyptian Streets, Urban Design for Human Respect
Currently: Development Supervisor in Cairo“Studying at UC Berkeley was one of the major milestones in my life. The Masters of Urban Design Program  has contributed in a great way to my current professional career and that was due to the presences of outstanding faculty members, in addition to the variety of classes offered. Which made me gain different and comprehensive perspective  while working on any project.”Hometown: Beirut, Lebanon
Thesis: Deconstructing a Freeway, Restoring a Waterway. 
Currently: New York City, working with the department of City Planning. “The experience at Berkeley was really rewarding because I was able to learn a lot about Urban design in the US but also learn about different urban conditions around the world. My classmate were all international and many did their thesis about their cities, so this was really enriching. Also, I was part of many group projects, which gave me the opportunity to learn how to work collaboratively and with people from different majors and backgrounds. Berkeley has finally given me confidence as a designer, trying to explore new horizons and challenging myself, thanks to the very supportive professors and their positive energy.”Hometown: India

Currently: Urban Development Consultant at GFDRR - World Bank, Washington DC“During the course of my study at UC Berkeley, I furthered my knowledge on theories of  disaster risk management, global poverty, hazard risk mapping and analysis and climate change adaptation, through combination of various classes and workshops. My graduate thesis, to develop an integrated growth model for a high-risk prone area in Port-au-Prince, tackled interconnected themes such as unemployment, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, waste management practices, food insecurity, environmental degradation, and so forth. The study brought forward urban issues that resonate in many international cities at risk, which eventually led me to work on policy recommendations and strategies for multiple post-disaster recovering cities in past few years. For my current role at World Bank, i am providing research and analytical support to invest in urban resilience,in order to make cities and the urban poor more resilient. Therefore, the experience at UC Berkeley, has been an invaluable asset in attaining my career goals.”Hometown: Milan, Italy

			The College of Environmental Design's application cycle opens in September, for fall-semester admission the following year. You must submit the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and all supplemental materials required by your program, as described under Required Application Materials, by your program's application deadline. Only online applications (including letters of recommendation) are accepted.
			See Programs + Deadlines for your program's application deadline.
			While you do not need an undergraduate degree in a specific field to apply to our professional master's degree programs, you must have earned your bachelor's degree at an accredited university.
			For the Ph.D. programs, it is strongly preferred that applicants have a master's degree in a related field.
			No, the graduate programs at CED offer fall admission only.
			At a minimum, the Statement of Purpose should indicate, with clarity and focus, your purpose for entering the graduate program, your proposed emphasis of study, and any special interest(s) in the field. It should highlight your intellectual and practical background for graduate school, and your perspective on how the college's resources and those of the UC Berkeley campus would enable you to find an intellectual home here. You should give us a sense of who you are and why you feel that a Berkeley degree will help you reach your goals. Also, what you have done, written, experienced or learned that makes you an interesting candidate.
			For tips on writing the Statement of Purpose, please see Writing the Statement of Purpose on the UC Berkeley Graduate Division website.
			The Ph.D. is a research-oriented degree, and the dissertation — an in-depth research study — is the centerpiece of doctoral study. The Ph.D. admissions committee will therefore read your Statement of Purpose seeking an account of your proposed research topic and prior research experience, and looking for evidence that you are prepared to undertake a significant, sophisticated, independent and in-depth project related to it. You should remember that your competence and intellectual potential to undertake dissertation research is among the most important criteria considered by the doctoral admissions committee.
			Yes. The Personal History Statement should convey how a combination of life experiences, idealism, role models, education and work experiences have influenced your decision to apply, as well as how any teaching, research, and professional or public service contributions you have made have promoted diversity and equal opportunity.
			For tips on writing a Personal History Statement, please see the Personal Statement Guide on the UC Berkeley Graduate Division website.
			No. Only online letters of recommendation are accepted. Submit the names of your recommenders through the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application. The recommender should provide his or her personal impression of your intellectual ability, aptitude in research or professional skills, character, and the quality of previous work and potential for future productive scholarship. Please have at least one letter of recommendation come from someone in academia.
			While we require recommenders to submit online letters, we will accept letters sent from a university letter service.
			The College of Environmental Design does not accept transfer students at the graduate level, and applicants are reviewed based upon their prior degree(s) obtained. While the college has no formal process for transferring coursework, admitted students may request to waive certain required courses if previously completed coursework fulfills those requirements; however, this will not decrease the number of units required to complete the degree program.
			We do not accept applicants who have completed the same degree program at another institution, whether in the U.S. or abroad, unless they can show that the curriculum of the completed program differs substantially from UC Berkeley's. If this is the case in your situation, contact your graduate program adviser to discuss the issue further.
			UC Berkeley graduate admissions policy allows an applicant to apply for only one single-degree program or concurrent-degree program during a given admission cycle.
			No. Every applicant, regardless of citizenship, is required to submit the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and supplemental admissions materials.
			Yes, applicants may apply for admission as long as completion of the undergraduate degree occurs prior to the beginning of the fall program at UC Berkeley. If you are admitted, a final transcript showing the conferred degree must be sent to your graduate adviser.
			If you are reapplying to a graduate program, you must submit a new UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and pay the application fee. If you would like to reuse some portion of your previous application, please email your graduate adviser, providing your name, year of previous application, and list of application items you would like reused. If you are reusing transcripts and letters of recommendation, please include the names of the institutions and recommenders. The College of Environmental Design keeps past applications for three years.
			No, admission to the College of Environmental Design is for a degree program only. However, UC Berkeley Extension offers a concurrent enrollment program that allows individuals to take classes (space permitting) in degree-offering departments. Full class participation is allowed, and grading is based on the same standards as those for students in the UC Berkeley degree programs.
			No, we do not conduct interviews as part of the graduate admissions process. However, if you are interested in visiting the college or speaking with a graduate adviser, please contact us. Visitors in general are always welcome on the UC Berkeley campus, and regularly scheduled campus tours are available through campus Visitor Services.
			If your degree program requires that you take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) (see Required Application Materials — Examinations), you must have your official score reported to the UC Berkeley Graduate Division by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). There is no minimum score requirement. Note: Register for the GRE early, and choose a date that will allow your score report to arrive on time for admissions review.
			Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must demonstrate English-language proficiency by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination. Minimum required scores are 570 for the paper-based test, 230 for the computer-based test, and at least 90 for the internet-based test (iBT). Minimum required IELTS score is a 7 on a 9-point scale.
			Foreign applicants who have baccalaureate degrees from educational institutions at which instruction was in English must take the GRE rather than the TOEFL. Contact the UC Berkeley Graduate Admissions Office with any questions.
			The University requires a minimum grade-point average (GPA) of 3.0, B, or equivalent. You may use our GPA calculator to determine your GPA. Note to students who attended a U.S. institution: GPA calculations are based on coursework taken after the first two years of undergraduate study. Note to students who attended an international institution: GPA calculations are based on all undergraduate coursework taken.
			There is no minimum required score for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). GRE test scores are good for five years. The minimum required scores for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) are 570 for the paper-based test, 230 for the computer-based test, and 90 for the iBT (internet-based test). For Fall 2015, tests taken before June 1, 2013 will not be accepted even if your score was reported to Berkeley. Please note that test scores are just one component of review when deciding admissions.
			Your GRE scores and undergraduate GPA constitute only a part of your application. These measures alone do not give the admissions committee a clear picture of you as an applicant. It is most important that you therefore take the time to draft an excellent Statement of Purpose that allows the committee to get to know you and your goals, and that you select your recommenders carefully.
			No. Examination substitutions are not permitted for programs that require the GRE.
			Once you have submitted your application, you may confirm the status of any application components (test scores, letters of recommendation) by returning to the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application. Please plan ahead and schedule any needed examinations (GRE, TOEFL) at least one month prior to your application deadline so that we may have timely receipt of your scores.
			Note: Due to the quantity of applications the College of Environmental Design receives, it is difficult for our graduate advisers to answer individual inquiries regarding application status. In the event we need to contact you, please ensure that emails from your program advisers are not processed as SPAM.
			Unofficial notifications of acceptance are emailed to applicants by mid-March, and applicants who have been recommended for admission are notified by the UC Berkeley Graduate Division soon thereafter. Only the written notice of the Dean of the Graduate Division of UC Berkeley constitutes approval of admission. Correspondence with faculty or staff of the College of Environmental Design, no matter what the content, will not commit the University to an approval of admission.
			The required application materials form the foundation for a comprehensive admissions review by our faculty. Applications are reviewed thoroughly. Along with your letters of recommendation, great emphasis is placed on your Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement. Luckily, these are the two things that you can really work on! We also take into account an applicant's work or volunteer experience. It's not required, but can play a positive role in the application review.
			No, the graduate programs do not have a deferral option.
			The University of California resident classification policy for tuition purposes can be found on the Office of the Registrar's Establishing Legal Residence webpage.
			There is no separate application for departmental merit-based fellowships. In addition to completion of the appropriate fellowships section of the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application, submission of the required application components will automatically qualify you for fellowship eligibility. If awarded a departmental fellowship, you will be notified in your departmental admission offer.
			Continuing graduate students can apply for merit- and need-based fellowships, as well as for Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) positions. We do our best to allocate fellowship funds equitably, with both student need and merit in mind. Some fellowships are by faculty nomination only. GSI and GSR positions are announced each semester, and incoming students are eligible to apply for these positions as well.
			Ph.D. funding is made on a case-by-case basis and involves multi-year funding packages, which may include a combination of teaching appointments and research and departmental fellowships.
			It is beneficial for applicants to seek financial support that is independent of University sources. If you are an international student, look for fellowships from your home country or through international agencies.
			NOTE: In order to receive fellowship support through the University, applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents must apply for need-based financial aid, which requires the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), .

The San Francisco Bay Area is the nation’s capital of gourmet food and freshly roasted coffee, and Berkeley offers everything from the best cafes and ethnic eateries to world-renowned restaurants. If you can’t find it here, it does not exist. Sixth, we have the best and friendliest staff in our departments. You will never go hungry at Berkeley — for food, friends or knowledge.
			The College of Environmental Design's application cycle opens in September, for fall-semester admission the following year. You must submit the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and all supplemental materials required by your program, as described under Required Application Materials, by your program's application deadline. Only online applications (including letters of recommendation) are accepted.
			See Programs + Deadlines for your program's application deadline.
			While you do not need an undergraduate degree in a specific field to apply to our professional master's degree programs, you must have earned your bachelor's degree at an accredited university.
			For the Ph.D. programs, it is strongly preferred that applicants have a master's degree in a related field.
			No, the graduate programs at CED offer fall admission only.
			At a minimum, the Statement of Purpose should indicate, with clarity and focus, your purpose for entering the graduate program, your proposed emphasis of study, and any special interest(s) in the field. It should highlight your intellectual and practical background for graduate school, and your perspective on how the college's resources and those of the UC Berkeley campus would enable you to find an intellectual home here. You should give us a sense of who you are and why you feel that a Berkeley degree will help you reach your goals. Also, what you have done, written, experienced or learned that makes you an interesting candidate.
			For tips on writing the Statement of Purpose, please see Writing the Statement of Purpose on the UC Berkeley Graduate Division website.
			The Ph.D. is a research-oriented degree, and the dissertation — an in-depth research study — is the centerpiece of doctoral study. The Ph.D. admissions committee will therefore read your Statement of Purpose seeking an account of your proposed research topic and prior research experience, and looking for evidence that you are prepared to undertake a significant, sophisticated, independent and in-depth project related to it. You should remember that your competence and intellectual potential to undertake dissertation research is among the most important criteria considered by the doctoral admissions committee.
			Yes. The Personal History Statement should convey how a combination of life experiences, idealism, role models, education and work experiences have influenced your decision to apply, as well as how any teaching, research, and professional or public service contributions you have made have promoted diversity and equal opportunity.
			For tips on writing a Personal History Statement, please see the Personal Statement Guide on the UC Berkeley Graduate Division website.
			No. Only online letters of recommendation are accepted. Submit the names of your recommenders through the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application. The recommender should provide his or her personal impression of your intellectual ability, aptitude in research or professional skills, character, and the quality of previous work and potential for future productive scholarship. Please have at least one letter of recommendation come from someone in academia.
			While we require recommenders to submit online letters, we will accept letters sent from a university letter service.
			The College of Environmental Design does not accept transfer students at the graduate level, and applicants are reviewed based upon their prior degree(s) obtained. While the college has no formal process for transferring coursework, admitted students may request to waive certain required courses if previously completed coursework fulfills those requirements; however, this will not decrease the number of units required to complete the degree program.
			We do not accept applicants who have completed the same degree program at another institution, whether in the U.S. or abroad, unless they can show that the curriculum of the completed program differs substantially from UC Berkeley's. If this is the case in your situation, contact your graduate program adviser to discuss the issue further.
			UC Berkeley graduate admissions policy allows an applicant to apply for only one single-degree program or concurrent-degree program during a given admission cycle.
			No. Every applicant, regardless of citizenship, is required to submit the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and supplemental admissions materials.
			Yes, applicants may apply for admission as long as completion of the undergraduate degree occurs prior to the beginning of the fall program at UC Berkeley. If you are admitted, a final transcript showing the conferred degree must be sent to your graduate adviser.
			If you are reapplying to a graduate program, you must submit a new UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application and pay the application fee. If you would like to reuse some portion of your previous application, please email your graduate adviser, providing your name, year of previous application, and list of application items you would like reused. If you are reusing transcripts and letters of recommendation, please include the names of the institutions and recommenders. The College of Environmental Design keeps past applications for three years.
			No, admission to the College of Environmental Design is for a degree program only. However, UC Berkeley Extension offers a concurrent enrollment program that allows individuals to take classes (space permitting) in degree-offering departments. Full class participation is allowed, and grading is based on the same standards as those for students in the UC Berkeley degree programs.
			No, we do not conduct interviews as part of the graduate admissions process. However, if you are interested in visiting the college or speaking with a graduate adviser, please contact us. Visitors in general are always welcome on the UC Berkeley campus, and regularly scheduled campus tours are available through campus Visitor Services.
			If your degree program requires that you take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) (see Required Application Materials — Examinations), you must have your official score reported to the UC Berkeley Graduate Division by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). There is no minimum score requirement. Note: Register for the GRE early, and choose a date that will allow your score report to arrive on time for admissions review.
			Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must demonstrate English-language proficiency by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination. Minimum required scores are 570 for the paper-based test, 230 for the computer-based test, and at least 90 for the internet-based test (iBT). Minimum required IELTS score is a 7 on a 9-point scale.
			Foreign applicants who have baccalaureate degrees from educational institutions at which instruction was in English must take the GRE rather than the TOEFL. Contact the UC Berkeley Graduate Admissions Office with any questions.
			The University requires a minimum grade-point average (GPA) of 3.0, B, or equivalent. You may use our GPA calculator to determine your GPA. Note to students who attended a U.S. institution: GPA calculations are based on coursework taken after the first two years of undergraduate study. Note to students who attended an international institution: GPA calculations are based on all undergraduate coursework taken.
			There is no minimum required score for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). GRE test scores are good for five years. The minimum required scores for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) are 570 for the paper-based test, 230 for the computer-based test, and 90 for the iBT (internet-based test). For Fall 2015, tests taken before June 1, 2013 will not be accepted even if your score was reported to Berkeley. Please note that test scores are just one component of review when deciding admissions.
			Your GRE scores and undergraduate GPA constitute only a part of your application. These measures alone do not give the admissions committee a clear picture of you as an applicant. It is most important that you therefore take the time to draft an excellent Statement of Purpose that allows the committee to get to know you and your goals, and that you select your recommenders carefully.
			No. Examination substitutions are not permitted for programs that require the GRE.
			Once you have submitted your application, you may confirm the status of any application components (test scores, letters of recommendation) by returning to the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application. Please plan ahead and schedule any needed examinations (GRE, TOEFL) at least one month prior to your application deadline so that we may have timely receipt of your scores.
			Note: Due to the quantity of applications the College of Environmental Design receives, it is difficult for our graduate advisers to answer individual inquiries regarding application status. In the event we need to contact you, please ensure that emails from your program advisers are not processed as SPAM.
			Unofficial notifications of acceptance are emailed to applicants by mid-March, and applicants who have been recommended for admission are notified by the UC Berkeley Graduate Division soon thereafter. Only the written notice of the Dean of the Graduate Division of UC Berkeley constitutes approval of admission. Correspondence with faculty or staff of the College of Environmental Design, no matter what the content, will not commit the University to an approval of admission.
			The required application materials form the foundation for a comprehensive admissions review by our faculty. Applications are reviewed thoroughly. Along with your letters of recommendation, great emphasis is placed on your Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement. Luckily, these are the two things that you can really work on! We also take into account an applicant's work or volunteer experience. It's not required, but can play a positive role in the application review.
			No, the graduate programs do not have a deferral option.
			The University of California resident classification policy for tuition purposes can be found on the Office of the Registrar's Establishing Legal Residence webpage.
			There is no separate application for departmental merit-based fellowships. In addition to completion of the appropriate fellowships section of the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application, submission of the required application components will automatically qualify you for fellowship eligibility. If awarded a departmental fellowship, you will be notified in your departmental admission offer.
			Continuing graduate students can apply for merit- and need-based fellowships, as well as for Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) and Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) positions. We do our best to allocate fellowship funds equitably, with both student need and merit in mind. Some fellowships are by faculty nomination only. GSI and GSR positions are announced each semester, and incoming students are eligible to apply for these positions as well.
			Ph.D. funding is made on a case-by-case basis and involves multi-year funding packages, which may include a combination of teaching appointments and research and departmental fellowships.
			It is beneficial for applicants to seek financial support that is independent of University sources. If you are an international student, look for fellowships from your home country or through international agencies.
			NOTE: In order to receive fellowship support through the University, applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents must apply for need-based financial aid, which requires the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), .

Email one of our Ambassadors!I love art and I love math, and I thought architecture sort of combined the two, making it the perfect major for me! In my free time, I love to bake, and I really enjoy hiking Berkeley's many trails. In the future, I would love to work on international projects and travel the world. When I'm not in the studio you will probably find me watching youtube videos or petting/ admiring a dog. Additionally I enjoy playing volleyball and taking photos with my film camera. Taking photos and developing in film encourages me to explore cities on foot and helps me slow down in my fast-paced environment.I love to visit new places and try out new food. When I first came to Berkeley, I had the opportunity to try out Thai food, Indian curry, Hawaiian poke, Japanese Korean fusion, and Mediterranean food among many others for the first time ever! Recently, I've enjoyed exploring a lot of places in Oakland, Walnut Creek and Mission area in San Francisco. I look forward to travel further out and explore more places like Napa Valley, Yosemite, Marin and Lake Tahoe.Hey! I'm Chadwick, 1st year SED major here. I'm super passionate about the intersection of building design and sustainability (Trombe walls and equity). I chose SED because I love the variety of classes I can take and the emphasis on research and design. CED is my home, and I am happy to show you around! On my free time, I love to watercolor and listen to podcasts - ask me about those things too. I'm very interested in the intersection between health and place, specifically concerning sustainable urban food systems. I've had so many opportunities to share my interests with my peers through my involvement in food discourse, and I am thankful to CED for giving me the chance to explore subjects I never would have before. One professional goal that encapsulates my interest in place and health is going to grad school to receive a joint Master's in Public Health and City Planning! Hey ya'll! As an Urban Studies major, I find myself fascinated by people and the power we have as designers of the built environment to influence how people interact with each other and the space they are in. I love how CED lets me explore different interests in sustainability and urban design as well. Outside of Wurster I love going on hikes or sleeping on the Glade. Feel free to say hi or ask me a question if you see me around! I am pursuing a major in architecture in CED because I find it a gift to be able to see my ideas existing in real life through drawings and models. I am minoring in Sustainable Environmental Design to support my interest in Net Zero Energy buildings and natural lighting with architecture. When I am not in Wurster, I mostly listen to music or sing while doing other work because music takes me to a new world.For all of my time spent on a computer designing by myself, I really enjoy interacting with people. I have done a lot of work in student affairs as an orientation leader and an admissions ambassador which really allowed me to share a lot of experiences and be a part of many stories on this campus. I also really enjoy getting out of Berkeley into the greater bay area to visit museums, restaurants, and shops which allows me opportunities to inhabit and learn from a variety of spaces.As an Architecture major and City Planning minor, my goal is to design more inclusive public spaces in cities. I chose CED specifically because the interdisciplinary nature of the college allows me to take classes across departments and gain a well-rounded understanding of the city. Outside of Wurster, I’m involved in a student organization that teaches dance at local after school programs, sponsors on-campus dance workshops, and teaches dance at retirement homes. I also love going on hikes with my dogs back home and listening to music, especially from animated Disney movies.My interest in architecture is definitely rooted in traveling and seeing all kinds of cool buildings. I've been really into design and architecture documentaries recently but I also love watching movies in general. In my free time, I like to walk around in the city and take pictures of run-down, deserted houses (FUN!). As an architecture major, I am interested in developing an understanding of how adapting our built environment to combat climate change and social injustice can be accomplished simultaneously. I'm also interested in other branches of design, including graphic and web design. Outside of Wurster, I like to search for new food places in the Bay Area and go to concerts!

			If you are a prospective freshman applicant, see the UC Berkeley Office of Undergraduate Admissions website.
			If you are a prospective transfer student,
			Yes, students must declare one of the four CED majors at the time of application to the college. Even if you are certain about which major you want, you can still benefit from doing some research into the content of the programs before you apply.
			If it is not possible for you to complete pre-approved lower-division environmental design courses at a California community college or at UC Berkeley through Summer Sessions or UC Berkeley Concurrent Enrollment/Extension, contact us prior to submitting your application to have your coursework evaluated. Syllabi, course descriptions, and work samples are required and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Follow the course evaluation guidelines and contact the CED undergraduate advising office for more information.
			Both in-state and out-of-state applicants must complete all lower-division major and general education courses required for admission. Contact us prior to submitting your application to have your coursework evaluated. Syllabi, course descriptions, and work samples are required and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.

			Yes, CED does grant course credit for Advanced Placement (AP) exams, Advanced Level (A-Level) exams, and International Baccalaureate (IB) exams taken prior to admission at UC Berkeley. See the credit tables on our website.
			If you are exploring college options with your daughter or son, check out the Cal Parents website, your portal to the University of California, Berkeley. There's a wealth of information online, plus programs and staff available to address your individual questions.
			For more information on architecture programs in the U.S. and Canada, check out the Guide to Architecture Schools published on-line and in paperback by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture.
			During their first two years (whether at UC Berkeley or at another college prior to admission as a transfer student), architecture majors complete all general education and lower division major requirements.
			During the second two years, students select one of two major tracks: Studio or Project. See the architecture major handbook for more information.
			Detailed course descriptions are available on the architecture courses webpage.
			At UC Berkeley, the Master of Architecture is the accredited professional degree offered by the department. The undergraduate degree in architecture is a liberal arts, not a professional degree. In addition to offering a sound and well-rounded education, the undergraduate degree in architecture provides pre-professional competency for entry-level employment in architecture, graduate work in architecture, or further studies in a related environmental design field.
			For information about becoming licensed in California, see the California Architects Board of the Department of Consumer Affairs, the American Institute of Architects, and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB).
			Whether you select a school that offers a 5-year accredited degree or one that offers a 4-year liberal arts degree depends on your interests and goals. See the AIA/AIAS Arch Careers website for an explanation of different types of architecture degrees and degree programs.
			In most cases, 5-year programs are professional degrees that prepare students for a career as a licensed architect. Examples of 5-year programs include Cal Poly, Cal State Pomona, and the Southern California Institute of Architecture.
			"4+2" refers to a combination of a 4-year liberal arts degree plus an accredited 2-year master's degree. A liberal arts major in architecture offered by schools like UC Berkeley, UCLA, or the universities of Illinois and Michigan is generally broad, flexible, and interdisciplinary in nature. You will study the social, historical, and scientific aspects of architecture as well as the broader urban and ecological context of environmental design.
			At Berkeley, you will enroll in classes with landscape architecture and urban studies majors. You will also take classes throughout the University with students from all backgrounds and academic interests. Berkeley provides you with research and study-abroad opportunities as well as a huge range of enrichment activities.
			A portfolio is not required for admission. If you are a transfer applicant unable to take articulated courses to fulfill the lower-division design requirements, course syllabi and samples of your work are required to evaluate whether you are sufficiently prepared for the upper-division studios. Submit these materials to the CED Office of Undergraduate Advising for review prior to your application to the university.
			AutoCAD remains the most common software for producing architectural drawings, but it is slowly being replaced by a variety of other programs. For this reason, it is essential that you regularly teach yourself new software skills. You will always be learning new programs, and there is no "correct" set of software to use.
			Many schools and employers want you to know the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign). These are indispensable, and you will be using these frequently in studio courses here. You will also gain experience with 3D modeling. At CED the most common program is Rhinoceros, but Modo, 3D Studio Max, Maya, form-Z, and Blender are all quite useful. Learning these will give you more flexibility to model your designs. A good software combination for modeling might be Rhino and either Maya or Modo.
			Don't think of these programs as distinct working environments, but rather as a set of tools that should be integrated with the design process. You should be able to model in 3D based on a sketch, and to use 3D simulations as aids for making physical models.
			You should also be aware that these programs are used in concert, not separately. For example, one might transfer files from Illustrator to Rhino, from Rhino to Illustrator and Maxwell (a 2D simulation program), from Maxwell to Photoshop, from Photoshop to Illustrator, and from Illustrator and Photoshop to InDesign. Knowing how to transfer work between programs is as important as knowing how to edit the work within any given program.
			See Computing @ CED for additional information.
			The undergraduate curriculum in landscape architecture centers upon creative and ecologically tuned design, and introduces students to the breadth of knowledge common to the profession. See the landscape architecture major handbook for a full description of college and major requirements for the landscape architecture major.
			Detailed course descriptions are available on the landscape architecture and environmental planning courses webpage.
			Almost all of our undergraduates are able to find jobs in the profession directly upon graduation. The largest concentration of landscape architecture firms in the world is located in the San Francisco Bay Area.
			For more information about licensure and careers, see the American Society of Landscape Architects website.
			Yes, almost all of our undergraduates are accepted into the M.L.A. programs of their choice.
			Our program has a professional practice course, Landscape Architecture 160, which places undergraduates in internships at local landscape architecture firms.
			The range of work that landscape architects are qualified to do is very broad. The following is just a short list of specializations: residential gardens, public parks, regional and national parks, public open space, urban plazas, public housing, community design, master planning of towns, cities, and housing developments, community participation, ecological restoration, bioremediation and site-specific environmental artworks.
			If you are interested in careers in landscape architecture, take a look at the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), produced by the U.S. Department of Labor. It contains useful information about the nature of the work, qualifications and training, earnings, and the employment outlook. The OOH also contains detailed information about landscape architecture-related occupations.

			Yes, landscape architecture is the original "sustainable design." It is the foundation on which the practice has been built. Our program is an integration of ecology, science and art, with an emphasis on restoring and creating environments for the human community.
			Being in the College of Environmental Design gives you incredible exposure to all of the design arts — architecture, city and regional planning, visual studies. CED is a wonderful, dynamic, and creative environment with a wide range of lectures, exhibits, and installations happening all the time. Our students are encouraged to express ecological design as an artform. Additionally, many of the iconic works of the profession exist in the Bay Area for you to visit first-hand. These sites are visited during many class field trips.
			No, our program is currently not accredited, but you are qualified to take the state boards for a landscape architecture license after you work three years with a licensed landscape architect.
			The urban studies major is organized around core courses in the Department of City and Regional Planning and electives in the College of Environmental Design and in departments across the campus, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the major. The core courses introduce students to the tenets of urban planning and to the key theories and analytical frameworks in urban studies.
			City and regional planning courses train students in the different sectors of urban studies and planning, from housing and community development to urban economics. In their senior year, students are encouraged to complete a capstone experience, be it an urban planning studio, a self-guided thesis, or an internship.
			See the major handbook for a full description of college and major requirements for the urban studies major.
			Detailed course descriptions are available on the city and regional planning courses webpage.
			The minor in city and regional planning consists of five upper division courses that train students in the professional practice of urban planning. It is focused on the professional character of planning. The urban studies major is interdisciplinary. While urban planning lies at its core, the major also allows students to choose courses in keeping with their interests, which may range from urban design to social theory to environmental justice.
			An internship is a great way to connect your academic experience with the professional work arena. Many CED students take advantage of the opportunity to complete an internship and some even create their own internships. For more information on internships, see the Career Center website and the CED Career Services section of this website.
			Our alumni have been successful in many different careers. Quite a few have gone on to graduate school — in city planning, architecture, public health. Others are engaged in the practice of urban planning. Yet others are involved in public interest and nonprofit work. Some are busy in business-oriented careers such as real-estate development.

For a full-on experience, join us for Cal Day, our annual Open House extravaganza!Photo: David Schmitz   The Center for Environmental Design Research (CEDR) is a center that fosters research in environmental planning and design, ranging from the local environments of people within buildings to region-wide ecosystems, Research at CEDR is highly interdisciplinary utilizing skills and knowledge of people across campus in civil & environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering & computer science, public health, public policy, psychology, business, energy & resources, and more. The Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD) is a center that aims to critically investigate and help improve processes and outcomes that shape urban equity around the world through the collaborative and interdisciplinary research of students, faculty, and visiting scholars. Over its long history, IURD has sponsored research in numerous disciplines. Principal research areas involve creating inclusive cities, urban governance, healthy cities, place and mobility, understanding city science, and urban environment. In all of its research projects, IURD emphasizes interdisciplinary and cooperative study. As the first school to combine the disciplines of architecture, planning, and landscape architecture into a single college, CED was also among the first to conceptualize environmental design as inseparable from its social, political-economic, and cultural contexts. Across all three departments, CED’s faculty research local and global challenges with this unique concept of environmental design in mind. One of the premier architecture, landscape architecture, and city and regional planning libraries in North America, the Environmental Design Library includes more than 210,000 volumes and subscriptions, as well as thousands of electronic resources from around the world used to support the teaching and research programs of the College of Environmental Design. CED’s library contains a myriad of department specific collections, rare and limited edition books and original reproductions, as well as reference and research services provided by CED’s friendly and knowledgeable librarians.  The Environmental Design Archives holds more than 200 collections documenting the built and landscaped environment. These records span more than a century, 1890-2014, and contain primary source materials such as correspondence, reports, specifications, drawings, photographs, models, and artifacts. The Archives holds records of not only California’s early important architects, but also contemporary and lesser-known architects and designers from around the world.  The Visual Resources center is a library of teaching and research images, with over 82,000 digital images, over 300,000 35mm slides, and 37,000 lantern slides depicting architecture, landscapes, cities, and related material. In addition to the Center’s extensive collection of images, it also provides services that help faculty and students create digital images for classroom use, create digital images from slides or archival material, and to create digital version of 35mm slides and Lantern slides in the Center’s collection for teaching use.  The Cal Design Lab at Wurster Hall is an experimental studio space that promotes hands-on, interdisciplinary design activities. Faculty and students from UC Berkeley’s many schools and departments come together at the Cal Design Lab to work on critical design challenges. The goal of the lab is to be a nexus for design research and practice, and to facilitate discourse that transcends different design disciplines. The lab offers formal space for transdisciplinary seminars and projects, as well as informal space for student teams to work and interact with design coaches or mentors. Whether your interests lie in design, planning, research, teaching, public policy or community activism, our programs prepare you to take a leadership role in your chosen career.As a student at CED, you might officially join one department (or two), but you can make yourself at home in other departments as well, through courses, international studios and workshops. And further opportunities abound across the world-class UC Berkeley campus. An interdisciplinary approach to design and planning is one of the hallmarks of CED, and as a result, our graduating students are equipped with the skills they need to be successful in their chosen careers, and prepared for the numerous challenges the world faces today.The College of Environmental Design's admission cycle begins in September, when the UC Berkeley Graduate Division online application becomes available.

Ultimately, planners advocate the best use of a community’s land and resources for residential, commercial, educational, and recreational purposes. When beginning a project, planners work with public officials, community members, and other groups to identify community issues and goals.Using research, data analysis, and collaboration with interest groups, planners formulate strategies to address issues and to meet goals. They also may help carry out community plans, oversee projects, and organize the work of the groups involved. Projects may range from a policy recommendation for a specific initiative to a long-term, comprehensive area plan.Planners use a variety of tools and technology in their work, including geographic information systems (GIS) that analyze and manipulate data. GIS is used to integrate data with electronic maps. For example, planners use GIS to overlay a land map with population density indicators. They also use statistical software, visualization and presentation programs, financial spreadsheets, and other database and software programs. Some planners work on broad, community-wide plans; others focus on specific issues.

Landscape architects design these areas so that they are not only functional but also beautiful and harmonious with the natural environment. Landscape architects also plan the locations of buildings, roads, walkways, flowers, shrubs, and trees within these environments.Landscape architects use several different technologies in their work. For example, through the use of computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software, landscape architects prepare models of their proposed work. They then present these models to clients for feedback to demonstrate the final look of the project. Many landscape architects also use geographic information systems (GIS), which allow them to present data visually as maps, reports, and charts.Landscape architects undertake projects that seek to enhance the natural beauty of a space and provide environmental benefits. They may plan the restoration of natural places disturbed by humans, such as wetlands, streams, and mined areas. They may also design “green roofs” or rooftop gardens that can retain storm water, absorb air pollution, and cool buildings while also providing pleasant scenery. Managing storm water runoff is another important part of many landscape architectural plans because it protects clean water sources and natural ecosystems from pollutants. Landscape architects also play a role in preserving and restoring historic landscapes.HANDSHAKE is the Career Center's recruiting platform for UC Berkeley students.

One section of the of the exhibit will “surface” the diversity within CED’s History, particularly during the anti-Asian exclusion laws in the first half of the 20th Century. Despite these laws, there was a surprising number of Asian students in the architecture program; photographs of students and examples of their work will be featured. Another section will address gender and power and investigate the projects that women designers have created for powerful men and corporations, such as Julia Morgan for William Hearst, Geraldine Knight Scott for early Silicon Valley corporations, Cathy Simon for Terrapin Station the Grateful Dead Museum, and May Arbegast for Steve Jobs. The last section will serve as inspiration through examples of significant work created by a diverse group of designers whose papers are held in the CED Archives. These designers include Architects Don Hisaka, Roger Lee, Terry Tong, and George Rockrise; Landscape Architects Mai Kitagawa Arbegast, Walter Guthrie, Walter Hood, and Casey Kawamoto; and renderer Carlos Diniz. This exhibit aims to provide professional models and inspiration as well a narrative revealing the context between designer, client and project.Organized by Waverly Lowell “Queer/Urban” is a student-led initiative that includes a working group responsible for developing original work for conference presentation and publication around queer issues in relation to the contemporary city. The culmination of this initiative will be a symposium in Wurster Hall on April 28, 2017. Students have confirmed the participation of two junior scholars, Christina Hanhardt from the University of Maryland and Natalie Oswin from the University of Toronto, as well as a New York City filmmaker, Sara Jordenö. The students have been in contact with the Pacific Film Archive with plans to show Jordenö’s documentary at a public event the day before the symposium.  As the group finalizes the participation at the symposium, they will extend an additional invitation to one senior scholar experienced with the themes of queer and urban in their work to provide a keynote address. The main goal of the initiative will be to update the terms of the discussion of sexuality in relationship to the build environment as well as to create a broader dialogue on these issues within the CED community.Organized by Efstathios GerostathopoulosEddy Zheng is a formerly incarcerated individual who has been rehabilitated through the advocacy of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee. The screening of “Breathin': The Eddy Zheng Story” and the panel discussion with the formerly incarcerated Eddy Zheng will illuminate how planning and architecture has impacted him before, during and after his incarceration. Additionally, this project will explore how mass incarceration has shaped the built environment with the objective of raising awareness among planners through direct engagement with people within the American incarceration system. Specifically, this project will raise awareness on how the built environment serves as a barrier to re-entering populations as it sustains structural, spatial and economic discrimination against marginalized populations. Roger Chung, a professor and educator with the Asian Prisoner Support Committee, will be participating in this project and will provide insight on his work with rehabilitation programs, particularly leveraging resources to prepare formerly incarcerated individuals as they navigate policy, urban planning and public health issues in reentering society.Organized by Bo ChungThe Town is group composed of outstanding Bay Area artists, including choreographers Latanya D. Tigner and Colette Eloi, poet Marvin White, composer JooWan Kim, members of Ensemble Mik Nawooj and DDT dancers and drummers. The elements of classical music, Hip Hop, and spoken word in their performance will portray the complexity of Oakland by providing several cultural perspectives and by celebrating the history and underrepresented voices in the Bay Area. Their performance will take on the subject of Oakland's gentrification as an invitation for meaningful dialogue. It will explore class, status, and race during a time of transformation as well as the candid truth of life and survival in urban settings. Through artistic expression and a panel discussion, this collaboration will offer neighborhood strategies, encourage participation, and stimulate understanding as well as dialogue needed to build community relationships. The ultimate goal of this project will be to broaden the participants understanding of the impacts of rapid change on the neighborhoods, diversity and individuals of our cities.Organized by Kim Suczynksi Smith  This seminar uses disability as a resource to generate new design methodologies, formal innovation, and spatial experience. Through guest lecturers, readings and discussions, students will expand design thinking beyond functionality to the sensory, ceremonial and celebratory possibilities of difference.            Organized by Wanda Katja Liebermann (CED Alum; Visiting Scholar, Institute of Urban & Regional Development).This workshop will equip members of the CED community with tools to teach about power and privilege and heighten awareness about inequality and the struggle for social justice across disciplines within the College and the built environment.      Organized by Juan Sebastian Arias (MCP Student), Erin Lapeyrolerie (MCP Student) and CED Students of Color (CEDSOC)The (Re)thinking South discussion series aims to inquire about current modes of production of urban space informed by translocal flows of knowledge, material resources, and consumption, with case studies from Latin America, South-Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.Organized by Marianela D'Aprile (Architecture M.S.

Program: Master of Architecture (MArch)
About Me: I am currently in my second year of the three year M. Arch program, which I highly recommend! I'm from Guadalajara, MX and grew up in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. I chose this program because of its connections to the Bay Area's architecture firms as well as its strong history in design. I also got my BA in architecture here at UC Berkeley. Before beginning the M. Arch program, I was part of CED's architecture program as a researcher working with a professor on biologically inspired material systems. Last semester I began working as a GSI (graduate student instructor) for the Architecture department. I am very happy to answer any questions interested applicants and newly admitted students might have. Sonrisa Cooper

(510) 642-2965The Eastern Surfing Association has awarded its 2017 Marsh Scholarship to Landscape Architecture senior, Mya Kotalac (BA Landscape Architecture ‘18). The academic scholarship supports current members of the Eastern Surfing Association who are currently enrolled in college and is the largest and longest running scholarship program in the U.S. surfing community.“I am so grateful to receive this scholarship, especially from the surfing community I grew up with competing in the ESA,” she said.  Following graduation, Kotalac plans to apply to the master’s program of landscape architecture at Harvard as well as UC Berkeley.  “Thank you, ESA, for your support towards my educational goals.  My family and I are extremely grateful!” The ESA’s Marsh Scholarship began in 1981 to recognize and honor the accomplishments of the Marsh Family, specifically Mike Marsh who set an example by earning his law degree while fighting cancer. Over 120 awards have been made and over $150,000 has been awarded. ESA’s executive director Michelle Sommers said, “The ESA’s Marsh Scholarship is another example why this organization is about more than just surfing.  It was a difficult decision as we had many qualified applicants.  We are proud of the achievements that Mya has made, and cannot wait to see what her future holds.” Read the full story.Miriam Solis, 2017 Switzer fellow.Miriam Solis, a Ph.D student in the department of City and Regional Planning has been chosen as one of twenty environmental scholar recipients of the 2017 Switzer Environmental Fellowship, a program of the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation.  The Switzer Fellowship Program recognizes the achievements of environmental leaders and their potential to drive positive change.  Miriam Solis is a UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellow in the Department of City and Regional Planning.

Rohaut is one of 18 students chosen from an international pool of applicants and will spend the next year exploring sustainable housing solutions in Latin America under the mentorship of Professor Hutson. Rohaut, whose background is in environmental engineering and urban planning, plans to apply the concepts of the circular economy to the urban challenges currently facing Latin America. “The region’s recent wildfires and earthquakes have damaged much of the housing and infrastructure in urban areas, forcing municipalities to rebuild and redesign underserved areas,” Rohaut explained. Over the course of the next year, she plans to incorporate the concepts promoted by the local circular economy to guide neighborhood revitalization and rehabilitation in a sustainable and human-centric manner. “In January of this year, Chile saw the biggest fire disaster that destroyed a lot of homes and displaced many people. So now that they have to reconstruct everything, how do they do that in a sustainable way without depleting resources and making it last?” Rohaut said. “Using Chile as my research model, I will explore urban rehabilitation and how to incorporate circular economy concepts and design thinking into revitalizing neighborhoods.” Read the full story.CONTACTUC BERKELEY CAMPUS RESOUCESImportant Prizes + Awards Dates and DeadlinesPrizes + AwardsCollege of Environmental Design

Please drop by or call with any advising questions, and explore our webpages for enrichment opportunities, graduation requirements, and procedural aspects and policies of the undergraduate programs at CED.The following information is designed for community college staff and faculty to assist with the course articulation process. If you are a student or a community college counselor wanting information about admission to the College of Environmental Design (CED), please refer to the Undergraduate Admissions section of our website.CED is very interested in building articulation agreements with California community colleges throughout the state. See the list below of colleges that already offer approved courses (note that this table is static and that ASSIST always contains the official and most up-to-date agreements). If your California community college would like to propose courses for approval, please follow the process and guidelines outlined below.As preparation for the majors in architecture, landscape architecture, and urban studies, students are required to take three environmental design courses before further studio work in their majors. Applicants to the urban studies major may substitute upper-division coursework for ARCH 11A and 11B after admission to UC Berkeley. Please see ASSIST for more information.IMPORTANT: Please work with your college’s articulation officer to initiate the review process. CED staff are happy to answer your questions, but the formal approval process will be managed by your articulation officer.Following are the course descriptions and the materials you will need to submit to your articulation officer for evaluation:From UC Berkeley General Catalog: Three hours of lecture and two hours of discussion per week. Environmental design involves the study of built, natural, global, and virtual environments. Various forms of practice include architecture, planning, urban design, and social and environmental activism. This course is a survey of relationships between people and environments, designed and non-designed, with an introduction to the literature and professional practices.For more detailed information, see the environmental design course descriptions by semester.When submitting a community college course for articulation to ENV DES 1, please include:From UC Berkeley General Catalog: Two hours of lecture and six hours of studio per week. Prerequisites: Environmental Design 1. Introductory studio course: theories of representation and the use of several visual means, including free hand drawing and digital media, to analyze and convey ideas regarding the environment. Topics include contour, scale, perspective, color, tone, texture, and design.For more detailed information, see the ARCH course descriptions by semester.When submitting a community college course for articulation to ARCH 11A, please include:From UC Berkeley General Catalog: Three hours of lecture, six hours of studio, and two hours of laboratory per week. Prerequisites: ARCH 11A. Introduction to design concepts and conventions of graphic representation and model building as related to the study of architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, and city planning. Students draw in plan, section, elevation, axonometric, and perspective and are introduced to digital media. Design projects address concepts of order, site analysis, scale, structure, rhythm, detail, culture, and landscape. Students learn to test the validity and consistency of their proposed course of action in critiques.For more detailed information, see the ARCH course descriptions by semester.When submitting a community college course for articulation to ARCH 11B, please include:The College of Environmental Design awards the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. To earn the B.A., you must successfully complete 120 units of course work and satisfy all requirements for the degree. The course requirements are designed to ensure that you acquire the background and the breadth you need for further learning and that you explore one subject in depth, your major.(May be met by IGETC or UC Reciprocity for transfer students.)Consult your major handbook for the major requirements:ArchitectureCity & Regional PlanningLandscape ArchitecutureSustainable Environmental DesignIndividual MajorSee the sections below on Unit Minimum, Semester Limit, and Senior Residence Requirement for details about these graduation requirements.Back to topCheck your degree progress each semester before you register for classes. To do this, log on to the Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) via Bear Facts. See the Office of the Registrar's website for information on how to access your degree audit.If you notice any errors in your degree audit, complete the following form immediately and submit it to the Office of Undergraduate Advising in 250 Wurster Hall so that your degree audit is accurate:NEW ADMITS. From June 8 through August 15, you can order a preliminary DARS report based on information you submitted on your UC application in November. An official determination of your transfer credit totals (based on official transcripts submitted to the college and to the Office of Undergraduate Admission) will be completed between mid-August and mid-October.Back to topStudents with a particular interest outside of their major may wish to pursue a minor. Minors generally consist of five upper-division courses plus any lower-division prerequisites to those courses. Any course taken for your minor may also be used to fulfill major and upper-division CED non-major requirements. Courses used to fulfill a breadth requirement may also be used to satisfy a minor requirement. Students may apply the non-CED version of a CED cross-listed course towards a minor. Consult with the staff adviser identified on the pages below for more information.CED students may also wish to pursue minors in any of the other undergraduate schools and colleges at UC Berkeley.Back to topCED students must enroll in at least 12 units each fall and spring semester. (Students entering UCB as freshmen with no prior units need to complete 15 units per semester to graduate in four years.)Minimum Units. You may request permission to take fewer than 12 units if you:IMPORTANT: Even though you may be enrolled in fewer than 12 units you are considered a full-time student if you pay full tuition and fees. Remember that even if you are approved to enroll in less than 12 units in a given semester, you must still graduate within the college’s semester limit (four semesters for transfer admits and eight semesters for freshmen admits).If you receive financial aid, you should check with the Financial Aid Office about the minimum unit requirements for your particular aid package.There is no minimum unit limitation during Summer Session unless you are receiving financial aid.Maximum Units. To request permission to take more than 20.5 units, see your major adviser.Back to topStudents admitted as freshmen must graduate within eight fall or spring semesters. Students admitted as junior transfers must graduate within four fall or spring semesters. Summer terms do not count toward this limit. Students approved for simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester.Because of admissions and enrollment demand at UC Berkeley and within the College of Environmental Design, exceptions to the semester limit are not considered except for those completing simultaneous degrees or studying abroad (see your major adviser for more information). The following situations do NOT justify an exception to the semester limit:Students interested in pursuing these options are encouraged to speak with an adviser about how UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, UC Berkeley Extension/Concurrent Enrollment, or enrollment in another institution might help them meet their goals.Back to topAfter reaching senior status (with 90 semester units earned), students must be registered in the College of Environmental Design and must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in at least two semesters at UC Berkeley as CED students. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least six passed units. Intercampus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units are not applied to this requirement.Students may use Berkeley Summer Sessions to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that six units of course work are completed.Participants in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a Modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 (excluding EAP) of their final 60 semester units in residence in the College of Environmental Design. At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status (90 units) is reached.If you are planning to go abroad or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension, see your adviser to determine how you can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.Back to topTo graduate with distinction, you must meet the grade-point average (GPA) requirement and complete at least 50 units in residence at Berkeley (this may include UCB Extension XB units and up to 20 units from UCDC or EAP), of which 43 units must be letter-graded (not including physical education activities courses). Transfer students need to make sure they complete the 50 units required at Berkeley if they want to qualify for honors.Your GPA in all letter-graded courses taken at Berkeley must be equal to or higher than the GPA established for honors in the year in which you graduate. These GPA cut-offs change slightly each year.The honors designation breakdown for students graduating Fall 2017 through Summer 2018 is:Back to topCurrent students may occasionally be approved to take coursework elsewhere to complete degree requirements. This can be a great strategy for ensuring compliance with CED’s semester limit. Talk with your adviser in advance about the course evaluation process for any courses you would like to take elsewhere.If you have been admitted to UC Berkeley as a freshman, you MUST complete the following courses at UC Berkeley: Reading and Composition R1A, ENV DES 1, ENV DES 11A, and ENV DES 11B.If you are a student at a community college looking to transfer into the College of Environmental Design, please see Transfer Applicants in the Undergraduate Admissions section of the CED website.Many students complete general education requirements at a community college during the summer.

For some students, they may simply struggle through a class or two or through a single term. For others, academic difficulty may be more severe and/or long-lasting. Whatever the situation, there are many ways you can make connections with staff, faculty, and fellow students that may help you overcome the difficulties you have been experiencing.As a student on academic probation, the two most important steps you can take are to gain as much information as possible about your individual academic situation and, based on this information, develop a plan to return to good academic standing in the following semester. This is the time to do the following:Students are placed on academic probation if their cumulative UC grade-point average (GPA) falls below 2.0. Should this happen to you, you will need to bring your cumulative UC GPA up to 2.0 the following regular semester (fall/spring), or you will be subject to dismissal.Students in this category are placed on academic probation if their GPA falls below 1.5 in any fall or spring semester ("Term"). To get back into good standing, you must earn a UC Berkeley term GPA of 2.0 the following regular semester (fall/spring) and maintain an overall GPA of 2.0. If you fail to meet these conditions, you will be subject to dismissal from the University.When students are unable to improve their academic performance and meet the conditions of their probation (as described above), they are subject to dismissal from the University. CED’s Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies will review the case of each student before making a decision about dismissal.Students in dismissal status may not continue their studies in the College of Environmental Design. Dismissal status is considered permanent; however, some students may elect to attend another educational institution, work to improve their academic performance, and request special permission to return to UC Berkeley. While this may be an option, the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies will only consider readmission after dismissal if the student demonstrates tangible readiness to return, usually in the form of significantly improved academic performance and demonstrated ability to focus on a specific, attainable academic course of study. Your adviser will be able to discuss these and other options with you.The College of Letters and Science has some excellent resources for students on probation that are relevant for CED students. In particular, see:Back to topDetailed information about Repeating Courses is available on the Office of the Registrar’s website.If you repeat courses in which you received a D+, D, D-, or F, the units are counted only once and only the most recently earned grades and grade points are used for the first 12 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade-point average is based on all grades assigned and total units attempted.If you repeat a course in which you received a grade other than a D, F, NP, or U, the course will count as part of your class schedule for the semester and the grade you earn will be listed on your transcript. However, the grade will not be included in your GPA, and the course units will not count toward graduation unless unless the course description in the UC Berkeley Catalog states "course may be repeated for credit."Back to topStudents wishing to be considered to earn one major in CED and a second in another college must complete the simultaneous degrees petition found on the Forms + Documents page, which will be reviewed by both colleges. You must complete all degree requirements for each college within nine semesters (freshmen admits) or five semesters (transfer admits). CED does not allow double majors (completion of two majors within CED).Back to topStudents withdraw from study for many reasons — to work, travel, recover from an illness, or find their true academic direction. The advising staff can help you decide whether a withdrawal is your best option.See the Office of the Registrar (OR) website for information on how to withdraw from a semester or cancel your registration before the semester begins. The OR website also includes information on fee and financial aid adjustments for students who are withdrawing from a semester.To resume your studies in the college after withdrawing or after being absent for one or more semesters, 1. carefully review the Guidelines for Applying for Readmission [PDF], 2. follow the steps on the Office of the Registrar website, and 3. submit completed forms (SLR and application) and payment as instructed.Readmission, unlike the admission process, is not competitive.
