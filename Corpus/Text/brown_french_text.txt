          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownOur graduate program offers a lively intellectual environment where students explore French and Francophone literatures and cultures across a broad chronological and topical range and through a wide variety of critical approaches.  Our goal is to train scholars and teachers who have a solid grounding in all periods of French and Francophone literatures and who think, write, and teach creatively.  Students work closely with faculty who provide individualized attention to each and every student. Students are paired with a faculty mentor who provides support and advice on an informal basis, assists students in preparing conference papers and articles for publication and gives careful guidance during the job search. Our program has a strong record of job placement for our recent graduates.  Students in our program are guaranteed a competitive package of six years of academic year funding and four summers of financial support with full tuition remission and health and dental insurance coverage.  Students are eligible for a dissertation fellowship during the fifth or sixth year.  Additional summer funding is provided while they prepare for their preliminary exam, and a stipend for research travel is available during their dissertation fellowship year.  In addition to six years of funding, students may choose to participate in a year-long teaching exchange with the Université de Bourgogne (Dijon) or the Université de Lyon 2-Louis Lumière.A notable strength of our program is the in-depth training and experience students gain in language teaching, under the expert guidance of our Department’s language acquisition specialists.  Students serve as Graduate Teaching Assistants in our language program during their second, third, and fourth years, teaching one section per semester. Our TAs are fortunate to work with some of the very best undergraduates in the country and to avail themselves of the certificate programs offered by the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. The Department hosts lectures, mini-seminars and conferences, including Equinoxes, the annual graduate student conference.   Shared with the Department of Hispanic Studies, Rochambeau House affords graduate students dedicated study space with computers, printers, and scanners.  Funding from both the Graduate School and the Department is available for conference travel every year.  The Cogut Center for the Humanities and the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women offer fellowships for graduate students. The Office of Global Engagement´s Global Mobility Program funds Graduate Research Fellowships for doctorate-level students to conduct research abroad for a summer or academic semester.Graduate studies at Brown benefit from the accessibility of faculty across campus as well as the vitality of the humanities. Last but not least, Providence, Rhode Island is an affordable city with a vibrant cultural scene and an excellent quality of life.  It was recently named "the Country's Best Small City" by Architectural Digest and "America's coolest city" by GQ. For more information on the requirements and structure of the graduate program, and the application process, please consult the Graduate Handbook and Application pages.Director of Graduate Studies, David Wills, Room 230, Rochambeau House. Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe primary objective of our program is to prepare students to become skilled in using the French language and knowledgeable about the contributions of French and Francophone literatures and civilizations to human culture of the past and the present. Above all, our program aims to make all students conscious of the wealth and diversity of the human experience in language, the arts, and intellectual life. The Concentration in French and Francophone Studies aims to prepare students for future careers such as college and secondary teaching, translation, international relations and diplomacy, as well as provide a well-rounded education for careers not directly related to France.The program offers a variety of courses—in language, periods, genres, themes, major writers, film, civilization— that give every Brown student the opportunity to explore linguistic, literary, and cultural topics relating to the French-speaking world.  This diversification allows students to achieve linguistic proficiency and to construct a program according to their own aptitudes, interests, and goals.The faculty in the Department of French Studies specializes in many areas of French and Francophone literature and civilization from the Renaissance to the 21st century, including language acquisition and theory. It is possible to do independent studies in almost any area of the student's interest. Interdisciplinary opportunities (in film, history, the arts, semiotics) are strong. For more detailed information on the undergraduate program in French Studies, please consult the Concentration Program, the Language Program, and the Brown in France pages.Director of Undergraduate Studies: Thangam Ravindranathan, (401) 863-2740, room 208, Rochambeau House. Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownOverview  The concentration in French and Francophone Studies is committed to the pursuit of an interdisciplinary, linguistically rigorous, and textually informed understanding of French and Francophone literatures and cultures. Concentrators engage actively through their coursework with a wide range of texts and critical perspectives, pertaining to multiple literary genres, media, and contexts. They have opportunities to study different periods of French history as well as Francophone cultures beyond France.The concentration program is designed to encourage and support language-specific study. Literary texts and cultural documents are read principally in the original. Likewise, in most courses, French is the language of class discussions, presentations and research/critical papers. Concentrators thus achieve advanced proficiency in the language. By the time they graduate, they will have learned to read with knowledge and nuance and produced a varied body of critical work in French.Our concentrators are strongly encouraged to spend one or two semesters (usually in their junior year) in France or in a Francophone country to derive the richest benefits of linguistic and cultural immersion. Along with close reading and attentiveness to cultural context, effective writing—i.e. writing that is clear, rigorous, informed, nuanced and persuasive—is considered a key skill for the concentration in French and Francophone Studies. Thus all courses offered by the department (starting at the 600- level) are writing-intensive, designated WRIT, which means that they satisfy the University’s Writing Requirement. In our courses students have the opportunity to write at least two papers, and receive substantive feedback and advice as they develop their writing. All Brown undergraduates must complete at least one approved WRIT course by the end of their 4th semester, and a second WRIT course during their 5th-7th semesters.Students who have performed outstandingly in their concentration courses, have completed at least six concentration courses by the first semester of their senior year, and are highly recommended by two professors are eligible to apply for admission to the honors program.  Concentration Requirements A minimum of 10 courses is required for the concentration in French and Francophone Studies. Concentrators must observe following guidelines when planning their concentration. It is recommended that course choices for each semester be discussed with the department’s concentration advisor.-- FREN 600 is accepted for concentration credit-- Required courses:-- A maximum of four courses from study in France or a Francophone country may count toward the concentration, from either a single semester or an entire year. A year or semester of study abroad in France or a Francophone country is considered an integral part of the concentration and is therefore highly recommended-- Seven electives, respecting the following criteria: The Concentration Advisor for the Department of French Studies, Thangam Ravindranathan will be happy to discuss the concentration program in French Studies with interested students. She can be reached by e-mail (Thangam_Ravindranathan@Brown.edu), phone (401-863-2740) or in Room 208 during regular office hours.Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department offers a series of courses for the acquisition and practice of the French language. The Language Program's general philosophy and corresponding pedagogy derive from a recognition of the diversity of needs, interests and objectives among its students. The program strives to adapt to these individual differences in particular at the beginning level (with an accelerated track in FREN 0200) and, at the other end of the spectrum, in the advanced courses where students are encouraged to participate in the construction of their program of study by selecting their own readings and writing activities.The general objectives of the Language Program are the gradual mastery of the four basic language skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading comprehension and writing. In all courses (except Advanced Writing, FREN1610), class interaction is devoted entirely to oral communication: oral communicative activities at the beginning and intermediate levels gradually leading to discussions and free conversation as students become more advanced. Starting in the 5th-semester course, students may select their own readings, according to their interests and objectives. Writing activities at the advanced level (FREN 1510 and 1610) are also individualized, according to students needs and preferences.The course distribution is as follows: (Semester 1 and 2) FREN 0100-0200 (a year course)(Semester 3) FREN 0300(Semester 4) FREN 0400(Semester 5) FREN 0500 (prerequisite for 1000-level courses)(Semester 6) FREN 0600 (prerequisite for study abroad)(Semester 7) FREN 1510 (required of concentrators) (Semester 8) FREN 1610Students are normally placed at the appropriate level according to their high-school achievement in French. A placement test is administered at the beginning of each semester for those who have not been placed prior to their coming to Brown.Students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for one or two semesters, under the auspices of either the Brown-in-France program or a Brown-approved program in a francophone country. The sixth-semester language course (FREN 0600) is the pre-requisite for study abroad and specifically prepares students for that experience. Freshmen enrolled in FREN 0200 accelerated may be able to take FREN 0600 as early as 2nd semester sophomore year and to study abroad in their junior year.Further information on the Language Program may be obtained at the Department, during Freshmen orientation Week each fall, from individual course instructors, and from the Department of French Studies (Room 102).Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownFrench Studies Honors ProgramThe French Honors Program is intended for students who have excelled in their French concentration coursework and who seek to pursue during their senior year an independent research-based inquiry into a particular set of texts or questions (literary, historical, cultural, theoretical or linguistic) under the supervision of a thesis advisor.Eligibility and Application ProcedureA candidate for honors in French Studies will ideally have received no grade lower than an "A" in courses taken for her/his concentration. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Department. Courses taken S/NC may count towards the Honors Concentration if accompanied by a brief report (Course Performance Report) from the instructor attesting to performance equivalent to an A-grade.  The candidate must be in good standing, and have completed at least two-thirds of the courses required for the concentration (6 courses) by the application deadline.Applications for admission to the Honors Program are submitted by September 26 in the student’s seventh semester. This means that the candidate should ideally begin to think of his/her thesis project, and establish contact with a potential thesis advisor by the end of the spring semester of their junior year or in the first weeks of the fall semester of their senior year. Students generally choose as advisor a faculty member with whom they have taken a class, but they are also encouraged to contact others whose specialization aligns with their interests. If in doubt, the honors advisor can be consulted for suggestions of an appropriate advisor. (Note that faculty may not be easy to contact over the summer. Students are thus advised to seek contact during the academic year.) For the application (form available below), the student will provide a brief thesis proposal (1 or 2 paragraphs in French presenting the object of study and intended approach). The application must also feature a thesis title, the name and signature of the thesis advisor, and two recommendations from French Studies faculty. Upon admission, the student will also choose a second reader.Students applying for admission to the Honors Program for 2015-2016 must submit a completed application to the French Studies Honors/Concentration Advisor by September 26. Recommendation forms are to be filled out by members of the French Studies faculty who have close knowledge of the student's work, preferably through a course taken by the student during her/his sophomore or junior year. Please submit these forms to your recommenders no later than September 18. They will then be forwarded to the Honors Advisor (Thangam Ravindranathan) who, after reviewing the complete application along with the student's transcript(s), will make a determination about admission to the Honors Program.If accepted, this application allows the student to pursue the Honors Thesis Project. Honors is officially granted only when the student's two readers approve the completed thesis.RequirementsStudents pursuing honors in French Studies must take a minimum of twelve courses. In addition to the standard requirement of ten courses, FREN 1980 (Senior Thesis) is to be taken both semesters. This independent study is designed for the student to devote time to thesis research and writing under the supervision of a thesis advisor.The student is expected to work in close consultation with his/her thesis advisor and to respect deadlines for completion of the outline, drafts, and the final version of the thesis, which at the latest must be submitted by the end of the week after Spring Recess (see deadlines for 2015-2016 below). It is expected that the student and the thesis advisor will establish a schedule and meet on a regular basis through the entire year. (Meetings once every two weeks on average, particularly during the spring semester, are encouraged). The second reader may or may not be from the Department of French Studies, and may be consulted less frequently during the earlier stages of the research/writing, according to their availability and the student’s needs. However, the student is expected to share at least one advanced draft with the second reader before the final submission.   The final complete version of the thesis must be submitted by April 16. Students should submit one copy to each reader and one electronic and one hard copy of the thesis to the Concentration advisor.  Work submitted after the final submission deadline will not be accepted for Honors. In such cases, a grade will be given for the Senior Thesis course, but Honors cannot be awarded. The Senior ThesisTheses ordinarily range from 50 to 80 pages and are written in French. Topics, approach, and precise calendar of work should be decided in close consultation with the thesis advisor. Students are encouraged to consult previous French Honors theses to get a sense of the range of projects that are possible. The Research Essay: The thesis is usually a research-based essay dealing with primary sources (literary works, historical archives, etc.) consulted and cited in the original French. A meritorious Honors thesis will be written in competent and precise language and evince meaningful internal structure and coherence. It will formulate precisely its framing questions and provide textual support for its propositions while making clear their furthest stakes. While students are encouraged to cultivate the originality of their own questions or perspectives, they are also expected to be in productive dialogue with scholarship in the field. Accordingly, to be awarded Honors, a thesis will demonstrate a consistent citation style and clear and correct attribution of all terms and ideas not the student’s own. For citation styles (MLA being the most common in French Studies) students may consult the Writing Center’s guidelines:  http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Writing_Center/resources_writers/citing_sources.html)Students may consult Brown University’s Academic Code here: http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/curriculum/academic_code.phpThe Translation Thesis: Students may alternatively choose to undertake for their Honors thesis a work of translation. This choice must be made with prudence and in close consultation with the thesis advisor, so that there is agreement on the difficulty level of the chosen text, the argument for translating it, and expected standards of ambitiousness and precision in the translation. Usually the translation will be from French to English, though the case may be made on the rare occasion for translation from English to French. Students may choose to translate a whole work, select excerpts, or a series of texts (as in the case of poems or shorter narratives). In all cases, a translation thesis must, to qualify for French Honors, include a critical introduction or preface (a minimum of 10 pages) in which the translator demonstrates advanced knowledge of the place of the chosen text in its original cultural and literary context, engages reasonably with scholarship pertaining to the original text, and shows a mature understanding of the stakes and debates of translation as a practice.Honors students will be invited to present their work to members of the Department and fellow and potential French concentrators at the end of term sometime after the April final submission date.Calendar of Deadlines: Precise details regarding deadlines and nature/length of submissions must be established clearly between the student and his/her advisor. Suggested deadlines for major stages are as follows:http://www.brown.edu/academics/french-studies/resources/antidote-v8 Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWho has to take the Brown Placement Exam?How do I get help determining my correct placement?If, after reviewing the handout called "French Placement Test" you have trouble determining which course you should take, you may contact instructors of language courses or members of the department's language committee: Youenn Kervennic, Justin Izzo and Annie Wiart.What if the course/section I wish to take is not on my class list?It may happen that you haven't been able to register for the course you wish to take or that the Registrar, for some reason, rejected it.  Do not give up: remember that you have a few weeks to add courses without a fine.  And, given the way enrollments shift during the first week of classes, there is a good possibility that you can get into the course.  What you should do is go to the section(s) of the class that fit(s) your schedule and attend the first 3 days of class regularly.  If 2 classes that you need to attend meet at the same time, please go to one of them and speak with the instructor of the other course immediately before or after the class.  You must also do all the homework assigned in the course you wish to add.NB: shifting occurs mostly during the first week; by the second week it often becomes more difficult to find open sections.What do I do if after the first class I realize I have been placed too high or too low?There is no perfect placement tool and it may be the case that the test scores you got do not reflect your level.  The first thing to do is to talk with your instructor, who might be able to confirm your impression right away, or might direct you to a course supervisor or placement advisor.  It would also be a good idea to sit in on courses at a higher or/and lower level, and to talk to that/those instructor(s).I took my SAT II in French, what level should I go to?The current guideline is as follows for incoming students with recent results, all others should go directly to the placement tests:Below 300                  Take the placement test300-390                      FREN 0100400-450                      FREN 0200460-510                       FREN 0300520-590                       FREN 0400600-690                      FREN 0500700-800                      FREN 0600,0600L,0600IR, 0720, 0750,0760 or higherI took the AP French language exam, what level should I go to?5  -  Credit for FREN 0500. Recommended courses: 0600,0720,0750 or 07604  -  Credit for FREN 0400. Recommended course: 05003  -  No credit. Recommended courses: 0400 or 0500, to be confirmed by the placement test1-2  - No credit. Recommended courses: 0300 or 0400, to be confirmed by the placement testWhen I place at higher levels on the AP (4+), SAT II (700K+) or Brown Placement Exam (test 2: 80+), there is an array of courses I can choose from (FREN 0600/0600L/0600IR- 0720-0750-0760-1000+).  How do I know where to start?  In what order do I take these courses?See next question/answer if you are interested in a 1000-level course.Please note that at the 5th semester level, you should plan to take:At the 6th semester level, you have the choice between several tracks:Having passed one of these courses is the prerequisite for 1000-level courses.  You may take 2 or all 3, in any sequence.Can I take 1000-level courses right away?All 1000-level courses at Brown have prerequisites.  In French Studies, the equivalent of a 6th semester course, i.e., FREN 0600/0600L, 0720, 0750 and 0760, is the prerequisite.  Courses taken abroad or at another institution might be equivalent; students who scored a 5 on the AP test and/or above 95 on the Brown placement test 2 might qualify.  If this is your case you should consult with either a placement advisor or with the faculty member teaching the 1000-level course you are considering. What level of study is required for study in a French speaking country?  FREN 0600/0600L/0600IR.What level of study satisfies the International Relations Concentration requirement?  FREN 0600/0600L/0600IR.How do I get information regarding a concentration in French Studies?By consulting the Course Announcement section on Concentrations, consulting the French Department Brochure (available in the French Department Office, Rm 102 Rochambeau House), the French Studies website, or by speaking with our Concentration Advisor, Professor Thangam Ravindranathan any time during the year.Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownOur graduate program offers a lively intellectual environment where students explore French and Francophone literatures and cultures across a broad chronological and topical range and through a wide variety of critical approaches.  Our goal is to train scholars and teachers who have a solid grounding in all periods of French and Francophone literatures and who think, write, and teach creatively.  Students work closely with faculty who provide individualized attention to each and every student. Students are paired with a faculty mentor who provides support and advice on an informal basis, assists students in preparing conference papers and articles for publication and gives careful guidance during the job search. Our program has a strong record of job placement for our recent graduates.  Students in our program are guaranteed a competitive package of six years of academic year funding and four summers of financial support with full tuition remission and health and dental insurance coverage.  Students are eligible for a dissertation fellowship during the fifth or sixth year.  Additional summer funding is provided while they prepare for their preliminary exam, and a stipend for research travel is available during their dissertation fellowship year.  In addition to six years of funding, students may choose to participate in a year-long teaching exchange with the Université de Bourgogne (Dijon) or the Université de Lyon 2-Louis Lumière.A notable strength of our program is the in-depth training and experience students gain in language teaching, under the expert guidance of our Department’s language acquisition specialists.  Students serve as Graduate Teaching Assistants in our language program during their second, third, and fourth years, teaching one section per semester. Our TAs are fortunate to work with some of the very best undergraduates in the country and to avail themselves of the certificate programs offered by the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. The Department hosts lectures, mini-seminars and conferences, including Equinoxes, the annual graduate student conference.   Shared with the Department of Hispanic Studies, Rochambeau House affords graduate students dedicated study space with computers, printers, and scanners.  Funding from both the Graduate School and the Department is available for conference travel every year.  The Cogut Center for the Humanities and the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women offer fellowships for graduate students. The Office of Global Engagement´s Global Mobility Program funds Graduate Research Fellowships for doctorate-level students to conduct research abroad for a summer or academic semester.Graduate studies at Brown benefit from the accessibility of faculty across campus as well as the vitality of the humanities. Last but not least, Providence, Rhode Island is an affordable city with a vibrant cultural scene and an excellent quality of life.  It was recently named "the Country's Best Small City" by Architectural Digest and "America's coolest city" by GQ. For more information on the requirements and structure of the graduate program, and the application process, please consult the Graduate Handbook and Application pages.Director of Graduate Studies, David Wills, Room 230, Rochambeau House. Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownFRENCH STUDIES GRADUATE HANDBOOKINTRODUCTION Our Department's headquarters, the beautiful Rochambeau House, which we share with Hispanic Studies, has an efficient computer network, elegant gardens, and generous space for seminars, lectures, movie screenings, or friendly intellectual exchanges and conversation. The fifteen graduate students currently in our program form a supportive and cohesive group. A graduate student representative, elected by all the graduate students, functions as liaison among the different generations of graduate students in the department, between the graduate students and the faculty, as well as between students in French and those in other departments at Brown. Since 1993, the graduate students in the French department have organized an international colloquium called "Equinoxes," which takes place every spring. This colloquium has regularly attracted participants from the United States, Canada, France and other francophone countries. Keynote speakers are selected by the students and have included former Ph.D.s and colleagues from Ivy Leagues and other institutions. Every year, a number of graduate students are involved in exchange programs with the Universities of Bourgogne and Lyon. These programs, which involve teaching English to French students, are an important part of the cross-cultural and professional training of our students. Graduate students may also spend a year or a semester at another Ivy League university (through the inter-Ivy exchange), attend courses at Harvard during the semester, or participate in a Mellon Study Group through a grant from the Graduate School. During the summer, students may take part in the Dartmouth Institute of French Cultural Studies or the Cornell School of Criticism through a fellowship from the Cogut Humanities Center. OUTLINE OF PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PH.D. 1. The Department of French Studies requires sixteen courses for the Ph.D. These include tutorials, independent study projects, and courses in other departments. Individual course schedules and study programs are worked out with the Director of Graduate Studies. All graduate students must complete the Graduate School requirement of 24 tuition units. (For further information, see "Tuition Credit vs. Academic Credit" on the Graduate School website.) 2. The following courses are standard requirements: FREN 2900: Teaching Methods; and Departmental seminars and study courses at the 2000-level. Depending on students' previous preparation, these requirements may be waived with the approval of the Graduate Committee. 3. During Year 3 (students entering with Bachelors degree) / Year 2 (students entering with Masters degree), students complete their course work and take a two part preliminary examination, individually planned around topics selected from their studies.4. During the remainder of their time in the program, students research and write the dissertation. Depending on whether or not they enter the program with a Masters degree, students are expected to complete the program in five or six years. 5. The foreign language requirement may be satisfied by coursework or by passing an examination in one foreign language other than French. In many cases, students will need to acquire mastery of a foreign language beyond this minimum requirement for research or teaching purposes. 6. Financial aid is available in a variety of forms: fellowships for students in their first year, teaching assistantships beginning in the second year, and dissertation fellowships for two semesters during the fifth or sixth years. The graduate school guarantees four years of summer funding. Students should note the Graduate School requirement that all students teach for at least one semester during their sixth year. All financial awards are accompanied by a full tuition waiver and medical insurance. 7. The Graduate School requires all Ph. D. candidates to complete at least one year as a Teaching Assistant as part of their professional training. The practice in French Studies is for students to serve as Teaching Assistants for three or four years. 8. Students are required to respect the deadlines prescribed (Milestones) for completion of various components of the Ph.D. program. A schedule of Milestone Requirements appears at the end of this document. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.A. 1. Courses to be taken each semester are chosen in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. 2. One year of course work (eight, predominantly 2000-level courses) with a thesis (an essay of 50-60 pages) satisfies the degree requirements for the terminal M.A. Alternatively, students satisfy the M.A. requirement without writing a thesis by completing two years of course work (sixteen, predominantly 2000-level courses). 3. Candidates for the M.A. are expected to demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language other than French by passing a test, taking an appropriate course, or demonstrating that they have done university-level work in that language. 4. Students who have completed graduate-level work in French Studies at another institution should petition for Transfer Credits during the second semester of their first year at Brown.COURSE WORK 1. General Information The Graduate Program in French Studies offers training in a wide spectrum of genres, periods, and critical approaches, including cultural studies, literary and philosophical history, gender studies, narrative theory, postcolonial studies. Other course offerings include such fields as sexuality studies, social history, theater and film studies. In addition to required graduate seminars offered by the Department, students may take courses in other relevant departments at Brown (Africana Studies, Comparative Literature, History, Modern Culture and Media, etc.), as well as French Studies courses at the 1000-level. Students take four courses per semester during their first year and three per semester in the second year, and continue to take seminars and independent studies as necessary until completion of the Preliminary Exams. In addition to graduate seminars, there is a required course in Teaching Methods (FREN 2900), which is taken in the spring semester of Year 1. 2. Courses A. Until students have completed the first part of their preliminary exams, they are required to take all of the graduate seminars offered by the Department. Class sessions are devoted to brief lectures by the professor and to the exchange, discussion and critique of ideas. In addition to participation in class, students give oral presentations and write term papers in consultation with the instructor. B. Graduate students may also take undergraduate 1000-level courses for graduate credit. In such instances they will usually be required do supplementary research, reading, and writing suited to their preparation and to the nature of the course. In consultation with the instructor, they may also assist in the classroom by giving presentations and conducting discussions. C. FREN 2910 or 2920 (Tutorials or Independent Study courses) - Students may supplement course offerings through tutorials on topics suggested by members of the staff. Those topics may reflect current research developments or research interests of individual professors. Students, in turn, may propose Independent Study topics to individual members of the faculty. FREN 2910/2920 independent study courses enable students to examine closely particular literary, textual or linguistic problems or techniques and to investigate subjects not covered in regular course offerings. Students normally take no more than two FREN 2910/2920 courses (or independent study courses in other departments) per semester, and staff members usually teach no more than two per semester. Student and professor usually meet at least once every two weeks. D. FREN 2970 (Preliminary Examination Preparation) and 2980 (Reading and Research) Students register for these classes while preparing their Preliminary Exams and while writing their dissertations, respectively.3. Required Course FREN 2900 (Teaching Methods). All doctoral candidates take this course for graduate credit in the spring semester of Year 1, in preparation for teaching (see I, 7). Candidates for a terminal M.A. may also enroll in this course. It includes training in such areas as the psychology of foreign language learning, techniques of instruction, planning and structuring a course, textbook criticism, production of materials, and use of technology. Class observations and in-class practice teaching are an integral part of the course. Any request to waive or modify the above requirements must be addressed in writing to the Graduate Committee of the Department of French Studies. Such requests will be considered with respect to FREN 2900 only when the student presents evidence of both training for teaching and extensive teaching experience upon beginning graduate study at Brown. 4. Performance Expectations At the end of each semester, students receive a Course Performance Report (CPR) for each seminar or course they have taken. Students who fall behind schedule, or whose academic performance is deemed unsatisfactory, receive written notification of steps needed for improvement. Every January, the Graduate Committee meets to make recommendations to the Graduate School concerning student funding (teaching assistantships and dissertation fellowships). In order to qualify for continued funding, students must fulfill Milestone Requirements as listed in the schedule below. 5. Incompletes In exceptional circumstances only a student may request an "INC" as a grade for a course, denoting an incomplete. Incompletes require the prior consent of the faculty member teaching the course. Students are strongly advised against requesting incompletes: they can greatly impede progress through the program and can have a significant impact on the annual evaluation. Deadlines for making up incompletes are as follows: for courses taken in Semester I, by mid semester of Semester II; for Semester II, by the first day of the following semester. These deadlines can be extended only at the request of the instructor. However, any incomplete that remains one calendar year after the end of the semester in which the course was taken turns into an "NC" ("no credit"), and the student will have to make up that credit by taking another course. FOR RECENT AND CURRENT COURSE OFFERINGS, PLEASE REFER TO THE CURRENT COURSES SECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT WEBSITE: https://www.brown.edu/academics/french-studies/courses/graduate-coursesTHE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION 1. General The purpose of the Preliminary Examination is to assess students' knowledge of their chosen field of specialization, to evaluate their command of theoretical methods employed in the field, and to ensure that they possess the critical skills needed for scholarly research. Students take Preliminary Exams during Year 3 (students entering with Bachelors degree) or Year 2 (students entering with Masters degree) of study. The exams test students' general preparation in French Studies as well as their ability to conduct independent research. The Department's Graduate Committee reviews students' examination fields before approving them. It oversees the administration and evaluation of Preliminary Exams, establishes procedures and schedules, and reports on students’ progress to the entire Department. There are two Preliminary Exams. 2. First Preliminary Exam The First Preliminary Exam is a "Coverage Exam," intended to demonstrate knowledge of the corpus of French and Francophone literature. It is meant to complement work pursued in previous study and to ensure that students have studied works and authors from all areas. The written exam takes place the week before Labor Day, Year 3 (Bachelors) or Year 2 (Masters). Preparation begins the previous semester in accordance with the following chronology: A. In February of spring semester of Year 2 (Bachelors) / Year 1 (Masters), students meet with the Graduate Advisor to identify THREE periods to be covered, drawn from the following list: The Middle Ages; The Renaissance; The 17th century; The 18th century; The 19th century; The 2oth and 21st centuries; Francophone Literature. B. Over the course of spring semester, students meet with faculty members representing each of the chosen areas to establish a reading list of 10 works per area, and to discuss the texts, contexts, and possible approaches. Those three faculty members constitute the First Preliminary Exam committee. A comprehensive list of literary works and secondary readings for each period/area (Graduate Reading List) is available on the Graduate Studies website: https://www.brown.edu/academics/french- studies/sites/brown.edu.academics.french- studies/files/uploads/FS_Graduate%20Reading%20List.pdf Students choose from or modify that list in consultation with the members of their committee.C. By May 1, students give the Graduate Advisor their reading list consisting of 30 works (10 works per area). Each list is accompanied by a short statement (200-250 words) in which students describe the themes or questions that they consider to be most compelling in the works comprising the list. Each committee member develops a set of 2 exam questions, based on the pertinent list and statement. STUDENTS MUST HAVE LISTS APPROVED BY THEIR COMMITTEE BY MAY 1 TO BE PERMITTED TO TAKE THE EXAM AT THE END OF SUMMER. Summer funding is provided on the assumption that students will devote the summer to reading and preparing for the exam. D. The take-home written exam. The week before Labor Day (end of August), students are given 4 days to write 3 essays of 6-8 pages each (approximately 1500-2000 words per essay), in French. Students are given a choice between 2 questions for each of the three essays. E. Oral Exam. 10-15 days after the written exam, students meet with the First Preliminary Exam committee to discuss their essays. During this discussion, the student may be asked to develop parts of the written exam or to explore other works on the reading list. The exam is evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Students who fail any part of the exam have the right to repeat it one time, as directed by the committee. 3. Second Preliminary Exam The Second Preliminary Exam is a “Research Exam,” taken during Year 3 (students entering with Bachelors degree) / Year 2 (students entering with Masters degree). In comparison to the Coverage exam, the Research exam entails a more elaborated cultural, critical, and theoretical approach. It is taken in accordance with the following procedures: A. General Immediately following completion of the First Preliminary Exam, and no later than October 31 of Year 3 (Bachelors) / Year 2 (Masters), students constitute a committee of two professors working in the field(s) of primary interest, with a view to preparing for the Second Preliminary Exam. The Second Preliminary Exam is prepared throughout Year 3/2 and its final, oral component is taken no later than May 31 of Year 3/2. The Second Preliminary Exam has 3 components: Independent Study, Paper and Exam.B. Independent Study In fall of Year 3/2 students register for FREN 2970 (Preliminary Examination Preparation) under the supervision of one of their committee members. During the semester they read broadly within their chosen fields, developing, and modifying as necessary, a list of primary and secondary works that has been constituted in consultation with the professor. Those readings are designed 1) to provide a basic level of competence for eventual research and teaching within a recognized scholarly field, and 2) to provide the groundwork for more focused research undertaken in the spring semester. C. Paper In the spring semester students again register for FREN 2970 (Preliminary Examination Preparation) and write an article length paper (6500-8000 words) on a precise topic within their field. The particular perspective or emphasis of the paper is determined by the research interests of each student. The basis for the paper is a corpus of primary texts, literary or otherwise; and a secondary, theoretical or methodological corpus (books or articles). The extent of each corpus will be determined in consultation with the director and/or committee, but they must provide for detailed knowledge of primary materials and comprehensive understanding of critical work associated with those materials. The paper will represent an original contribution that complements published work in the field. It is submitted to both committee members no later than April 15 of Year 3 (Bachelors) / 2 (Masters). It should be written in the language in which the student plans to write the dissertation. D. Exam Once the paper has been accepted by both members of the committee, a copy of it is made available to any faculty member wishing to read it. The paper is presented by the student at an oral exam lasting approximately one hour. The student explains such matters as how their readings and interests led them to their topic, what problems were encountered in the course of research and writing, and directions for future research. The student presentation is followed by questions from committee members concerning aspects of the paper, its relation to the field, and the primary and secondary texts that form its basis. The exam is normally conducted in the language in which the student plans to write the dissertation. The following assessments of the exam are possible: pass with distinction, pass, conditional pass, and fail. Students who fail any part of the exam have the right to repeat it one time, as directed by the committee. Students who pass begin immediately to prepare the prospectus. PROSPECTUS1. Following completion of the Second Preliminary Exam students name two members of their committee, comprising a Director and First Reader. Both Director and First Reader are normally members of the Department of French Studies. The Second Reader is added at an appropriate time in consultation with the Director. The Second Reader is normally from outside the Department of French Studies, either from another department at Brown or from another University. 2. The prospectus is drafted in close consultation with the Director and First Reader. It consists of a succinct statement of aims and methods of inquiry and approach, comprehensive information concerning what has and has not been done on the topic, a tentative outline of sections and chapters of the dissertation, and a pertinent bibliography. The prospectus will also include the names of the dissertation Director and the First Reader. It should be written in the language in which the student plans to write the dissertation. The usual length of a prospectus is 3500-4000 words (not including bibliography). 3. Before the prospectus can be formally approved, students are required to schedule a discussion with the Director and First Reader that is designed to ascertain whether, on the basis of the prospectus, they are ready to proceed with researching for, and writing the dissertation. Once the Director and First Reader have approved the prospectus, a copy of it is forwarded to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), who then forwards it to the Graduate Committee. Once the prospectus has been approved by the Graduate Committee, students are informed that they have advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM 1. Teacher training is an essential component of the Graduate Program in French. Students receive training both before they begin teaching and while they are Teaching Assistants. They normally teach only one course each semester in order to ensure timely completion of their graduate work. 2. Students take Teaching Methods (FREN 2900) for credit before they begin teaching. The content of this course includes items such as the following: the psychology of the learning process in foreign language teaching; methods and techniques; planning and structuring a single class, the week's work, a semester's work; textbook criticism; production of materials; use of teaching aids, such as audio-visual and computer based materials. 3. All students complete at least one year of teaching in the Department, and most teach for three or four years. The Language Committee assigns Teaching Assistants a section of FREN 0100, 0200, 0300, 0400, 0500, 0600, 0610 or 0620 in keeping with their teaching performance and the needs of the Department. The Language Committee seeks to give students experience at as many different levels as possible. Teaching Assistants work under the supervision of a faculty course coordinator who meets regularly with all TAs, visits their sections at least once per semester, and writes a Teaching Performance Report (TPR) at the end of the semester. Two copies of each TPR are forwarded to the Director of Graduate Studies, and one copy is given directly to the student.PROFESSIONAL TRAINING 1. The Department regularly offers workshops on professionalization: one on preparing abstracts and papers for conferences; one on preparing article manuscripts for publication; and one on preparing for the job market. 2. At least once a year, the Department will organize a workshop during which a student (or students) will circulate among other students and at least one professor a seminar paper to be revised for publication. Students preparing their Second Preliminary Exam are encouraged to present their work in this context. The purpose of the workshop is to provide the student/s with constructive feedback for revisions. 3. Preparation for the job market, in particular for an academic career, requires careful consideration of current trends and preferred fields. Students should discuss such questions in close consultation with their advisor(s). The Department works actively with students as they prepare for the job market. Dissertation advisors review their advisees' dossiers (cover letter, research statement, teaching portfolio, etc.), and the DGS organizes mock interviews for students prior to the MLA or a campus visit. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS 1. For the M.A. candidates are expected to demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language other than French or English, either by passing a test or taking an appropriate course, or by demonstrating to the Department's Graduate Committee that they have done previous work in that language at an acceptable level (equivalent to FREN 0500, a fifth semester language course at Brown). 2. For the Ph.D.: In order to be admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D., students should have a minimum competence in one other language (besides French and English). Such competence is demonstrated: A. by satisfactory completion (B grade or better) at Brown of language courses at levels comparable to FREN 0500 or above. Students should keep in mind that only language courses on the 1000-level will be accepted for graduate credit. B. by taking one of the reading courses especially designed for graduate students by different departments at Brown (e.g. GRMN 0220, etc.); C. in special circumstances, the Department's Graduate Committee may waive the requirement on the basis of the student's previous record of work in that language at the college or university level.D. Beyond this minimal requirement, the Department strongly encourages students to achieve a superior command of at least one other language in addition to French for the Ph.D. This language should be chosen for research or teaching purposes. (For instance, Latin for a student working in Medieval Literature or Arabic for a student of North African Literature.) In such cases, the Department is willing to allow students to do some advanced course work (above 1000) in that language in place of normal graduate course work, or after they have taken the preliminary examination. MASTER'S AND DOCTORAL THESES 1. The M.A. Thesis The M.A. thesis is optional. Students may earn the M.A. degree either by completing one year of full-time study (eight courses) and writing a thesis (an essay of 50-60 pages) or by completing two years of full-time study (sixteen courses) without a thesis. The majority of students opt not to write an M.A. thesis. 2. The Doctoral Dissertation A. The Ph.D. dissertation (or thesis) is primarily a demonstration of students' capacity to treat profoundly a problem of some complexity, to communicate the results of their thoughts and findings and to show the implications of the latter for the chosen field. In this respect, it offers ample scope for original research and creative thinking. At the same time it is a training exercise that enables students to perfect techniques of critical and scholarly analysis. It is important to maintain a sensible balance between these functions. The goal is to achieve a meaningful contribution to the understanding of literature, culture, or language. B. Students consult with appropriate faculty members concerning the feasibility of their proposed dissertation topic and the selection of a director. Both the Director and First Reader will normally come from the Department. The Second Reader will normally be from outside the Department of French Studies, either from another department at Brown or (where appropriate) from another University. In close consultation with the dissertation committee, students draft their dissertation prospectus as soon as possible after completion of the Second Preliminary Exam, and have it approved no later than December 31 of Year 4 (Bachelors) / Year 3 (Masters). In the prospectus, they give a succinct statement of their aims, define the methods of inquiry and approach, demonstrate knowledge of what has and has not been done on their topic, tentatively outline the sections and chapters of the dissertation, and include a pertinent bibliography. The prospectus also includes the names of the dissertation director and the first reader. The usual length of a prospectus is 3500-4000 words (not including bibliography).C. Once the dissertation committee has discussed the prospectus with the student, and approved it, it is forwarded to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), who then forwards it to the Graduate Committee. The DGS informs students once their prospectus has been approved by the Graduate Committee. Students become candidates for the Ph.D. only when the Graduate Committee has approved their dissertation prospectus. Students advance to candidacy no later than December 31 of Year 4 (Bachelors) / Year 3 (Masters). Candidacy is also contingent upon fulfillment of the language requirement. D. Once the dissertation has been completed and accepted by the three members of the dissertation committee, an oral examination (approximately 1.5 hours) takes place. This examination, called the Dissertation Defense, consists of a public presentation and discussion of the thesis. (Approximately one week prior to the defense, the candidate leaves a complete copy of the dissertation in the Department Manager's office for the faculty to read.) The purpose of the defense is to assess the rigor and value of the findings set forth in the dissertation. During the first fifteen minutes of the defense the candidate offers a brief oral overview of the thesis, its contribution to literary studies, and possible plans for future expansion. The major portion of the exam (somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes) consists of a dialogue in which the candidate responds to questions of the committee and other faculty. The author of the dissertation is expected to voice cogent, well-informed answers and to demonstrate professional expertise in the domain to which the thesis makes its contribution. The Graduate School requires that all three readers accept the thesis. At the end of the defense, the readers consult in private and vote on whether to pass the dissertation. Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe primary objective of our program is to prepare students to become skilled in using the French language and knowledgeable about the contributions of French and Francophone literatures and civilizations to human culture of the past and the present. Above all, our program aims to make all students conscious of the wealth and diversity of the human experience in language, the arts, and intellectual life. The Concentration in French and Francophone Studies aims to prepare students for future careers such as college and secondary teaching, translation, international relations and diplomacy, as well as provide a well-rounded education for careers not directly related to France.The program offers a variety of courses—in language, periods, genres, themes, major writers, film, civilization— that give every Brown student the opportunity to explore linguistic, literary, and cultural topics relating to the French-speaking world.  This diversification allows students to achieve linguistic proficiency and to construct a program according to their own aptitudes, interests, and goals.The faculty in the Department of French Studies specializes in many areas of French and Francophone literature and civilization from the Renaissance to the 21st century, including language acquisition and theory. It is possible to do independent studies in almost any area of the student's interest. Interdisciplinary opportunities (in film, history, the arts, semiotics) are strong. For more detailed information on the undergraduate program in French Studies, please consult the Concentration Program, the Language Program, and the Brown in France pages.Director of Undergraduate Studies: Thangam Ravindranathan, (401) 863-2740, room 208, Rochambeau House. Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownOverview  The concentration in French and Francophone Studies is committed to the pursuit of an interdisciplinary, linguistically rigorous, and textually informed understanding of French and Francophone literatures and cultures. Concentrators engage actively through their coursework with a wide range of texts and critical perspectives, pertaining to multiple literary genres, media, and contexts. They have opportunities to study different periods of French history as well as Francophone cultures beyond France.The concentration program is designed to encourage and support language-specific study. Literary texts and cultural documents are read principally in the original. Likewise, in most courses, French is the language of class discussions, presentations and research/critical papers. Concentrators thus achieve advanced proficiency in the language. By the time they graduate, they will have learned to read with knowledge and nuance and produced a varied body of critical work in French.Our concentrators are strongly encouraged to spend one or two semesters (usually in their junior year) in France or in a Francophone country to derive the richest benefits of linguistic and cultural immersion. Along with close reading and attentiveness to cultural context, effective writing—i.e. writing that is clear, rigorous, informed, nuanced and persuasive—is considered a key skill for the concentration in French and Francophone Studies. Thus all courses offered by the department (starting at the 600- level) are writing-intensive, designated WRIT, which means that they satisfy the University’s Writing Requirement. In our courses students have the opportunity to write at least two papers, and receive substantive feedback and advice as they develop their writing. All Brown undergraduates must complete at least one approved WRIT course by the end of their 4th semester, and a second WRIT course during their 5th-7th semesters.Students who have performed outstandingly in their concentration courses, have completed at least six concentration courses by the first semester of their senior year, and are highly recommended by two professors are eligible to apply for admission to the honors program.  Concentration Requirements A minimum of 10 courses is required for the concentration in French and Francophone Studies. Concentrators must observe following guidelines when planning their concentration. It is recommended that course choices for each semester be discussed with the department’s concentration advisor.-- FREN 600 is accepted for concentration credit-- Required courses:-- A maximum of four courses from study in France or a Francophone country may count toward the concentration, from either a single semester or an entire year. A year or semester of study abroad in France or a Francophone country is considered an integral part of the concentration and is therefore highly recommended-- Seven electives, respecting the following criteria: The Concentration Advisor for the Department of French Studies, Thangam Ravindranathan will be happy to discuss the concentration program in French Studies with interested students. She can be reached by e-mail (Thangam_Ravindranathan@Brown.edu), phone (401-863-2740) or in Room 208 during regular office hours.Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department offers a series of courses for the acquisition and practice of the French language. The Language Program's general philosophy and corresponding pedagogy derive from a recognition of the diversity of needs, interests and objectives among its students. The program strives to adapt to these individual differences in particular at the beginning level (with an accelerated track in FREN 0200) and, at the other end of the spectrum, in the advanced courses where students are encouraged to participate in the construction of their program of study by selecting their own readings and writing activities.The general objectives of the Language Program are the gradual mastery of the four basic language skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading comprehension and writing. In all courses (except Advanced Writing, FREN1610), class interaction is devoted entirely to oral communication: oral communicative activities at the beginning and intermediate levels gradually leading to discussions and free conversation as students become more advanced. Starting in the 5th-semester course, students may select their own readings, according to their interests and objectives. Writing activities at the advanced level (FREN 1510 and 1610) are also individualized, according to students needs and preferences.The course distribution is as follows: (Semester 1 and 2) FREN 0100-0200 (a year course)(Semester 3) FREN 0300(Semester 4) FREN 0400(Semester 5) FREN 0500 (prerequisite for 1000-level courses)(Semester 6) FREN 0600 (prerequisite for study abroad)(Semester 7) FREN 1510 (required of concentrators) (Semester 8) FREN 1610Students are normally placed at the appropriate level according to their high-school achievement in French. A placement test is administered at the beginning of each semester for those who have not been placed prior to their coming to Brown.Students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for one or two semesters, under the auspices of either the Brown-in-France program or a Brown-approved program in a francophone country. The sixth-semester language course (FREN 0600) is the pre-requisite for study abroad and specifically prepares students for that experience. Freshmen enrolled in FREN 0200 accelerated may be able to take FREN 0600 as early as 2nd semester sophomore year and to study abroad in their junior year.Further information on the Language Program may be obtained at the Department, during Freshmen orientation Week each fall, from individual course instructors, and from the Department of French Studies (Room 102).Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownFrench Studies Honors ProgramThe French Honors Program is intended for students who have excelled in their French concentration coursework and who seek to pursue during their senior year an independent research-based inquiry into a particular set of texts or questions (literary, historical, cultural, theoretical or linguistic) under the supervision of a thesis advisor.Eligibility and Application ProcedureA candidate for honors in French Studies will ideally have received no grade lower than an "A" in courses taken for her/his concentration. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Department. Courses taken S/NC may count towards the Honors Concentration if accompanied by a brief report (Course Performance Report) from the instructor attesting to performance equivalent to an A-grade.  The candidate must be in good standing, and have completed at least two-thirds of the courses required for the concentration (6 courses) by the application deadline.Applications for admission to the Honors Program are submitted by September 26 in the student’s seventh semester. This means that the candidate should ideally begin to think of his/her thesis project, and establish contact with a potential thesis advisor by the end of the spring semester of their junior year or in the first weeks of the fall semester of their senior year. Students generally choose as advisor a faculty member with whom they have taken a class, but they are also encouraged to contact others whose specialization aligns with their interests. If in doubt, the honors advisor can be consulted for suggestions of an appropriate advisor. (Note that faculty may not be easy to contact over the summer. Students are thus advised to seek contact during the academic year.) For the application (form available below), the student will provide a brief thesis proposal (1 or 2 paragraphs in French presenting the object of study and intended approach). The application must also feature a thesis title, the name and signature of the thesis advisor, and two recommendations from French Studies faculty. Upon admission, the student will also choose a second reader.Students applying for admission to the Honors Program for 2015-2016 must submit a completed application to the French Studies Honors/Concentration Advisor by September 26. Recommendation forms are to be filled out by members of the French Studies faculty who have close knowledge of the student's work, preferably through a course taken by the student during her/his sophomore or junior year. Please submit these forms to your recommenders no later than September 18. They will then be forwarded to the Honors Advisor (Thangam Ravindranathan) who, after reviewing the complete application along with the student's transcript(s), will make a determination about admission to the Honors Program.If accepted, this application allows the student to pursue the Honors Thesis Project. Honors is officially granted only when the student's two readers approve the completed thesis.RequirementsStudents pursuing honors in French Studies must take a minimum of twelve courses. In addition to the standard requirement of ten courses, FREN 1980 (Senior Thesis) is to be taken both semesters. This independent study is designed for the student to devote time to thesis research and writing under the supervision of a thesis advisor.The student is expected to work in close consultation with his/her thesis advisor and to respect deadlines for completion of the outline, drafts, and the final version of the thesis, which at the latest must be submitted by the end of the week after Spring Recess (see deadlines for 2015-2016 below). It is expected that the student and the thesis advisor will establish a schedule and meet on a regular basis through the entire year. (Meetings once every two weeks on average, particularly during the spring semester, are encouraged). The second reader may or may not be from the Department of French Studies, and may be consulted less frequently during the earlier stages of the research/writing, according to their availability and the student’s needs. However, the student is expected to share at least one advanced draft with the second reader before the final submission.   The final complete version of the thesis must be submitted by April 16. Students should submit one copy to each reader and one electronic and one hard copy of the thesis to the Concentration advisor.  Work submitted after the final submission deadline will not be accepted for Honors. In such cases, a grade will be given for the Senior Thesis course, but Honors cannot be awarded. The Senior ThesisTheses ordinarily range from 50 to 80 pages and are written in French. Topics, approach, and precise calendar of work should be decided in close consultation with the thesis advisor. Students are encouraged to consult previous French Honors theses to get a sense of the range of projects that are possible. The Research Essay: The thesis is usually a research-based essay dealing with primary sources (literary works, historical archives, etc.) consulted and cited in the original French. A meritorious Honors thesis will be written in competent and precise language and evince meaningful internal structure and coherence. It will formulate precisely its framing questions and provide textual support for its propositions while making clear their furthest stakes. While students are encouraged to cultivate the originality of their own questions or perspectives, they are also expected to be in productive dialogue with scholarship in the field. Accordingly, to be awarded Honors, a thesis will demonstrate a consistent citation style and clear and correct attribution of all terms and ideas not the student’s own. For citation styles (MLA being the most common in French Studies) students may consult the Writing Center’s guidelines:  http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Writing_Center/resources_writers/citing_sources.html)Students may consult Brown University’s Academic Code here: http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/curriculum/academic_code.phpThe Translation Thesis: Students may alternatively choose to undertake for their Honors thesis a work of translation. This choice must be made with prudence and in close consultation with the thesis advisor, so that there is agreement on the difficulty level of the chosen text, the argument for translating it, and expected standards of ambitiousness and precision in the translation. Usually the translation will be from French to English, though the case may be made on the rare occasion for translation from English to French. Students may choose to translate a whole work, select excerpts, or a series of texts (as in the case of poems or shorter narratives). In all cases, a translation thesis must, to qualify for French Honors, include a critical introduction or preface (a minimum of 10 pages) in which the translator demonstrates advanced knowledge of the place of the chosen text in its original cultural and literary context, engages reasonably with scholarship pertaining to the original text, and shows a mature understanding of the stakes and debates of translation as a practice.Honors students will be invited to present their work to members of the Department and fellow and potential French concentrators at the end of term sometime after the April final submission date.Calendar of Deadlines: Precise details regarding deadlines and nature/length of submissions must be established clearly between the student and his/her advisor. Suggested deadlines for major stages are as follows:http://www.brown.edu/academics/french-studies/resources/antidote-v8 Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWho has to take the Brown Placement Exam?How do I get help determining my correct placement?If, after reviewing the handout called "French Placement Test" you have trouble determining which course you should take, you may contact instructors of language courses or members of the department's language committee: Youenn Kervennic, Justin Izzo and Annie Wiart.What if the course/section I wish to take is not on my class list?It may happen that you haven't been able to register for the course you wish to take or that the Registrar, for some reason, rejected it.  Do not give up: remember that you have a few weeks to add courses without a fine.  And, given the way enrollments shift during the first week of classes, there is a good possibility that you can get into the course.  What you should do is go to the section(s) of the class that fit(s) your schedule and attend the first 3 days of class regularly.  If 2 classes that you need to attend meet at the same time, please go to one of them and speak with the instructor of the other course immediately before or after the class.  You must also do all the homework assigned in the course you wish to add.NB: shifting occurs mostly during the first week; by the second week it often becomes more difficult to find open sections.What do I do if after the first class I realize I have been placed too high or too low?There is no perfect placement tool and it may be the case that the test scores you got do not reflect your level.  The first thing to do is to talk with your instructor, who might be able to confirm your impression right away, or might direct you to a course supervisor or placement advisor.  It would also be a good idea to sit in on courses at a higher or/and lower level, and to talk to that/those instructor(s).I took my SAT II in French, what level should I go to?The current guideline is as follows for incoming students with recent results, all others should go directly to the placement tests:Below 300                  Take the placement test300-390                      FREN 0100400-450                      FREN 0200460-510                       FREN 0300520-590                       FREN 0400600-690                      FREN 0500700-800                      FREN 0600,0600L,0600IR, 0720, 0750,0760 or higherI took the AP French language exam, what level should I go to?5  -  Credit for FREN 0500.

Recommended courses: 0300 or 0400, to be confirmed by the placement testWhen I place at higher levels on the AP (4+), SAT II (700K+) or Brown Placement Exam (test 2: 80+), there is an array of courses I can choose from (FREN 0600/0600L/0600IR- 0720-0750-0760-1000+).  How do I know where to start?  In what order do I take these courses?See next question/answer if you are interested in a 1000-level course.Please note that at the 5th semester level, you should plan to take:At the 6th semester level, you have the choice between several tracks:Having passed one of these courses is the prerequisite for 1000-level courses.  You may take 2 or all 3, in any sequence.Can I take 1000-level courses right away?All 1000-level courses at Brown have prerequisites.  In French Studies, the equivalent of a 6th semester course, i.e., FREN 0600/0600L, 0720, 0750 and 0760, is the prerequisite.  Courses taken abroad or at another institution might be equivalent; students who scored a 5 on the AP test and/or above 95 on the Brown placement test 2 might qualify.  If this is your case you should consult with either a placement advisor or with the faculty member teaching the 1000-level course you are considering. What level of study is required for study in a French speaking country?  FREN 0600/0600L/0600IR.What level of study satisfies the International Relations Concentration requirement?  FREN 0600/0600L/0600IR.How do I get information regarding a concentration in French Studies?By consulting the Course Announcement section on Concentrations, consulting the French Department Brochure (available in the French Department Office, Rm 102 Rochambeau House), the French Studies website, or by speaking with our Concentration Advisor, Professor Thangam Ravindranathan any time during the year.Stay Connected with French StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
