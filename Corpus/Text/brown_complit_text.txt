For admission to the doctoral program, students usually will present evidence of sound training in literature written in three languages, one of which may be English. They will be expected to develop a strong enough competence in one of these literatures to be qualified to teach in a national literature department since comparatists are often hired in such departments or have joint appointments.The major literature is studied in a cross-cultural context linking it with the other two diachronically or synchronically. Students may pursue literary currents or follow the evolution of ideas or themes across linguistic boundaries, or may study features of genre, style, convention, etc. The program may also emphasize theory including poetics, stylistics, semiology, feminist, socio-cultural, post-structuralist, and post-colonial approaches.The Graduate School Admission Office employs an online application by CollegeNET, the application hosting service affiliated with the school. The deadline for submitting applications for admission with financial aid is December 15. Inquiries may also be addressed to the Director of Graduate Study, Department of Comparative Literature, Box E, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912 or by emailing our Department.The completion of the program requires development of language skills sufficient for advanced work in three literatures. The languages selected are chosen with a view to their appropriateness to the student's areas of special interest. The Department's major competence is in literary expression in western languages. However, our growing programs in classical and modern Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic provide opportunity for students trained in these languages. In addition, the study of both ancient and modern Hebrew is available through Judaic Studies. In at least one of the foreign languages presented, near native proficiency in speaking and writing in the case of a modern language will be expected. See the Language Competence section of the Graduate Procedures for specific requirements.Students entering with the B.A. will normally take 15 advanced literature courses and graduate seminars, spread over three years in the proportions respectively of 8, 6, 1, two or three of which may be individual work supervised by a staff member. In special circumstances students may obtain up to a year of course credit for graduate work done at other institutions. Students who enter already having completed some advanced work may be asked to proceed more quickly. Individual programs are worked out in consultation with the Director of Graduate Study to include:While the historical "coverage" by itself is not the aim of comparative literature, the Department does require a major literature examination just before the fifth semester which has coverage as a partial goal, in order to demonstrate the student's professional capacities in her/his national literature. It also requires a written comparative project, to be submitted in writing and presented orally during the sixth semester. This project allows the student to treat work from more than one literary tradition, and may become part of the dissertation. A topic will be chosen in consultation with a faculty comittee and worked out with the Director of Graduate Study. It is expected that the comparative project will be completed and approved, and the student advanced to doctoral candidacy, by the end of the third year. See Graduate Program Procedures.By the end of the third year of study the student is expected to select the area of focus for the dissertation. The student will ordinarily work under the close supervision of a member of the Comparative Literature faculty; the thesis must also be approved by two other readers, one of whom may be from outside the Department.Training and experience in teaching are major features of our doctoral program in Comparative Literature. The Department makes every attempt to provide its graduate students with teaching experience at Brown in undergraduate courses suited to the graduate student's interest. Teaching assistants work under the direct supervision of members of the professorial staff. At least two years of work as a teaching assistant are required for the Ph.D. The Department will keep students informed of positions as they become available in pertinent departments and at other institutions, and will assist them in presenting their candidacy for such positions.Advanced graduate students who have made substantial progress on their dissertations, who can document their success in the classroom, and who have the support of a faculty member willing to serve as a classroom mentor are invited to submit a proposal to teach an undergraduate course (below 1000-level) in the department. The proposal consists of a 200-word course description, a syllabus, a C.V. that includes a listing of teaching experience, and notes of support from the dissertation advisor and faculty mentor. It is due to the Director of Graduate Studies no later than October 31 of the academic year before the class is taught. The proposals will be evaluated by the department’s Graduate Committee on their merits; no more than two will be approved in any year; final approval will depend on the curricular needs of the department as determined by the Chair.The Department does not admit terminal M.A. candidates, nor does it require a Master's degree as a prerequisite for the doctorate. Students who are not recommended to proceed in the doctoral program at the end of the first year may take an M.A. by completing one year of full-time course work in residence (normally four courses each semester), satisfying two of the three language requirements for the Ph.D., and completing a Master's thesis consisting of an essay of 50-60 pages on a comparative subject. Alternatively, a student will receive the M.A. upon completion of the comparative project and advancement to doctoral candidacy.Students are supported by a fellowship in their first year.  Teaching responsibilities, and support in the form of a teaching assistantship, begin in the second year and continue through the fourth.  We offer a dissertation fellowship in the fifth year and a number of avenues to sixth-year funding, including interdisciplinary opportunities at Brown’s Centers and Institutes and stipend support from the department and the Graduate School.  In special cases, the Graduate School may cover tuition and health costs, but not stipend support, beyond the sixth year.  Please refer to the Graduate School web site for further information about financing graduate study at Brown.Related Departments and ProgramsThe language and literature offerings at Brown include the following: Classics (including Greek, Latin and Sanskrit), English, French Studies, German Studies, Hebrew, Hispanic Studies, Italian Studies, Portuguese and Brazilian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Linguistics, Slavic Languages.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownStudents may earn honors in the concentration by successfully presenting a thesis, for the preparation of which they will normally enroll in COLT 1990 in either or both semesters of their senior year.  These courses may not be used to satisfy the standard requirements for a concentration. Honors candidates must also normally earn more A's than B's in courses taken as part of the Comparative Literature concentration (or receive the equivalent faculty evaluation on a Course Performance Report for courses taken S/NC).Students should generally begin thinking about an Honors Thesis in their third year of course work. Students who plan to go abroad in the junior year are advised to give some thought to these matters before leaving; they may also want to write to certain professors from abroad, indicating their potential thesis interests. Optimally, it may be possible to devise a summer reading list for thesis research, so that the project already has some momentum when senior year starts.The Department expects students to have two readers for the honors thesis, and one of them should normally have some connection with the Comparative Literature department. In addition to discussing possible topics and directions for the thesis, students will want to discuss with the faculty person(s) procedural and technical matters as well. In particular, it is necessary to agree on deadlines for completing readings and submitting drafts, on the amount of consultation that is expected, etc. It is important that all parties have a clear sense of these matters. Students planning to do honors theses in the department must submit the titles and abstracts of their projects as well as the names and signatures of their directors and second readers by October 15. (Thesis Proposal form)Most students require two semesters to plan and complete an Honors Thesis. A substantial portion of writing on the thesis must be completed and submitted to the advisor(s) during the Fall semester. The second semester is devoted to completing the writing, and a full draft of the entire thesis must be submitted by March 15. The final complete version of the thesis must be submitted by April 15. Students should submit one copy to each reader and one electronic and one hard copy of the thesis to the Department. Honors in Comparative Literature is granted upon positive recommendation by the thesis advisors. The honors thesis is usually between 50 and 100 pages long. It is anticipated that a significant amount of research will go into this project. Students are expected normally to choose a topic that involves work in each of the foreign literatures they have presented for their degree; such foreign materials are to be dealt with (i.e., read and cited) in the original language, even though the thesis itself is generally written in English. It is also anticipated that the project itself is to be of a comparative nature. In some cases, it may be possible for a student to devise a thesis project that meshes the thesis investigation with creative writing.October 15: Students planning to do honors theses in the department must submit the titles and abstracts of their projects as well as the names and signatures of their directors and second readers.March 15: full draft of the entire thesis must be submitted.April 15: The final complete version of the thesis must be submitted.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownStudents do advanced work in the original language in at least three  literatures as demonstrated by the successful completion of at least two  courses in each of those literatures at the 2000 course level. In  certain cases, appropriate 1000 level courses may safisty this  requirement with the permission of the Director of Graduate Study. This  requirement is to be satisfied by the end of semester four. Students  whose linguistic competence requires them to take language courses below  the 1000 level may do so in consultation with the Director of Graduate  Study, but those courses will not count toward the course requirements  for the Ph.D. Normally at least the first foreign language requirement  will be satisfied through advanced courses during the first year.A standard of professional competence should be maintained within the  area of likely specialization. For example, a student intending to  specialize in the medieval period will offer an appropriate language  competence, Anglo-Saxon or Middle English for English, Middle High  German for German, Old French or Provençal for French, etc. Students  concentrating in Classics must offer both Latin and Greek; German is  also recommended. For those with specialties in medieval and  renaissance, Latin is recommended. Ordinarily two languages from the  same group -- Romance, Slavic, Germanic (exclusive of English) -- will  not be selected.Students will take an oral examination on their designated major literature by late September of Semester V.Students must declare the major literature on which they will be  examined by September 30 of the second year (i.e., Semester III). During  the spring semester of their second year, students will take at least  two regular courses and may elect one section of COLT 2980, devoted to  preparation for the major literature examination, as the required third  course. During the second year, the Director of Graduate Study will form  an exam committee in consultation with students. Committees will be  made up of members of the Comparative Literature faculty; a professor  who is not a member of the Department may serve on examination  committees at the discretion of the Director of Graduate Study in those  cases where a specialty not covered by departmental faculty is  presented. All students presenting a given literature at the same time  will be examined by one committee. The final reading list, described in  the next paragraph, is to be submitted to the Director of Graduate Study  by March 1 of the second year.The examination will be based on a list of 30 items covering the  chronological range of the literature in question. An item generally  consists of several works by the author in question, roughly three  novels or prose works, eight to ten plays, or two dozen or so poems. The  texts for each item are to be chosen in consultation with the  examination committee.Major literature reading lists for Classical Greek, Latin, English  and U.S. literature, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish are  available in the Comparative Literature office as well as on this  website. Students presenting lists in other languages and literatures  will consult with the Director of Graduate Study and appropriate faculty  in formulating reading lists.The examination will be administered in English by the three members  of the student's committee. It will last no more than two hours.  Questions will draw on the reading list, and will be of an appropriate  theoretical, historical, or textual nature. Passing will be decided by  majority vote taken directly after the examination.  If a student fails  the examination, one further attempt will be permitted, ordinarily  during the following semester. Normally students will either pass or  fail the examination as a whole, but in the event that the committee  determines a student has failed a portion of the examination,  the  committee may require that the student repeat that portion of the exam  at a later date. Ordinarily the re-examination will take place the  following semester.The comparative project provides an opportunity to begin focused  research leading to the dissertation, and to gain experience in  professional writing, oral presentation, and discussion comparable to a  conference situation or job interview.After passing the major literature examination, students will begin  formulating a topic for the comparative project during Semester V and  complete it during the third year. The topic for the comparative project  will be worked out in consultation with the student's preliminary  doctoral committee, consisting of three faculty members, to be  established by the student in consultation with the Director of Graduate  Study.Students must declare their intention of fulfilling the comparative  project requirement to the Director of Graduate Study and the Prelim  Committee at least eight weeks prior to the oral examination. In  Semester VI, students will submit the comparative project to their  examination committee in written form. A revised draft, to be considered  by the examination committee for the oral defense, must be submitted by  April 15th.The comparative project is an article length essay which may or may  not become a part of the dissertation. As stated above, the project  provides an opportunity to begin focused research on subjects possibly  leading to the dissertation.Approval of the written project must be given by each member of the  committee in writing to the Director of Graduate Study before the oral  examination can be scheduled.The candidate will give a brief presentation at the beginning of the examination, situating the project, and where appropriate, indicating how it might relate to the dissertation.A. Students should submit the doctoral thesis prospectus to their  dissertation committee and the Graduate Committee by September 30 of  their fourth year (i.e., Semester VII).  B. Typically, the prospectus will include a clear statement of the  objective of the dissertation, a discussion of the issues involved, a  selective account of the key sources (primary, secondary, and  methodological), and a chapter outline. Normally, it may run to about 10  pages; it will not usually exceed 15 pages.  C. After the prospectus is filed, members of the Graduate Committee,  and other members of the faculty, may offer comments on it.  D. If a student changes topic or advisor, a new prospectus may need to  be filed; this decision falls within the discretion of the dissertation  advisor.The requirements stated above are intended to provide both  comparatist training and preparation in one major literature (to  maximize placement possibilities) within a reasonable time (five years)  and with financial support. An effort will be made to provide teaching  experience not only in Comparative Literature, but also within an  appropriate foreign language or English, or Modern Culture and Media.  The timetable envisioned allows for the completion of course work, the  major literature examination and a comparative project by the end of the  third year, submission of the doctoral thesis proposal at the beginning  of the fourth, and one or two years of work to complete the doctoral  thesis.The department makes every effort to provide, but cannot guarantee,  support for five years through teaching assistantships and proctorships  in Comparative Literature and other appropriate departments. Both  fellowships and teaching assistantships are contingent on the timely and  successful completion of course work and examinations. Support for  students entering with substantial advanced work or an MA will normally  be three years with the possibility of a fourth year. In the case of a  student failing the major literature examination, provision will be made  for a second try. Except for that eventuality or in the case of serious  illness, this timetable should be adhered to in order for support to  continue. First year students will be reviewed at the end of Semester I  and again after Semester II. Subsequently all students are reviewed at  year's end and are notified in writing of their progress.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe undergraduate programs for concentration in Comparative Literature enable students to study literature in cross-cultural perspectives. The aim of the program is to encourage students to study a varied and illustrative range of literary topics rather than the total development of a single literary tradition. Concentrators in Comparative Literature should be willing to try different approaches to literature and to examine literary and aesthetic problems with sustained curiosity. Comparative Literature differs from other literature concentrations largely through its international focus and its broad-gauged view of art and culture in which the study of languages is combined with the analysis of literature and literary theory.True to the spirit of Brown’s New Curriculum, a concentration in Comparative Literature affords great academic freedom. Although the Comparative Literature concentration requirements that follow give shape and rigor to the major, they allow advanced courses in any literature department at Brown to count for concentration credit. Courses in related fields, when vitally relevant to an individual’s Comparative Literature studies, may also receive concentration credit. In other words, by no means are our concentrators limited to courses in the Comparative Literature department, though all are encouraged to take our courses because they generally enact cross-cultural work.It is important to note that English is commonly one of the languages that students apply to a concentration in Comparative Literature. Yet, basically any language--ancient or modern--supported at Brown may form part of a Comparative Literature concentration program. While our courses are offered in English (students may read texts in their original languages), concentrators also take courses in the national literature departments of their chosen languages. We encourage and help concentrators to study abroad.What follows are the three possible tracks of the concentration along with normative timetable expectations for each.  The expectation for students working in a non-European language or languages is that they will at least complete the equivalent of three years of college-level language study and, before they graduate, utilize their language proficiency in at least two courses agreed upon with their concentration advisor.Note:Students in the literature tracks not taking Honors are urged, but not required, to complete a senior essay, which may be less extensive in scope and length than the Honors thesis (see Guidelines for Honors Theses in Comparative Literature) but which should constitute an integration of some aspect of their study.Course options for fulfilling concentration requirements:  Spring 2017 | Fall 2016   | Spring 2016  | Fall 2015  It is possible for a student to accommodate a junior year abroad within his/her concentration program, provided that he/she plans for it early enough. In certain cases, a freshman may wish to consider spending his/her sophomore year abroad.Joint or double concentration programs may also be arranged if steps are taken early enough with Comparative Literature and the other department. The same is true of programs combining a concentration in Comparative Literature with a teaching certificate in English or a modern language. A student interested in such a program should consult the advisor in the Education Department and the advisor in Comparative Literature as early as possible (preferably by Semester V). Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe decision to major  in Comparative Literature may  well involve asking yourself what fruits the  concentration might bear  for your life after Brown. In the fall of 2010, the Department of  Comparative Literature  gathered information and ideas from our alumni  on this important question. We decided to contact our concentrators   from the classes of 2004 through 2008, under the assumption that they  have had  sufficient time to develop their after-Brown lives  significantly yet had  graduated recently enough to be launching their  careers in the present  challenging economic climate. The  survey sent  them asked:We  received many responses, all thoughtful and  illuminating. They indicate the array of careers that  can ensue from a  concentration in Comparative Literature. These include careers in  academia, the  arts and media, business, consulting, information  technology, healthcare,  journalism, law, marketing, public relations,  publishing, teaching, and  more.To  illustrate the diversity of career paths while  keeping our forum to a  reasonable length, we reproduce below a sample  of the responses to our survey,  organized by occupations and arranged  as a spectrum. (Each response appears in full and anonymously.) The  sample below also provides a sense  of the varied occupations that  certain professions have yielded. Perhaps most of all, the responses to   our survey offer texture: vibrant professional trajectories and  excellent  advice. We therefore encourage you  to peruse them in their  entirety, and we give sincere thanks to the alumni who  generously  contributed their thoughts.Thanks very much for these questions--I was  glad to  think about them and to look back on my time at Brown, which I  enjoyed so much  and regularly miss. If I can be  helpful in any other  way, please let me know.I live in New York and work in the editorial  department  at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, a book publishing house in  the city that  specializes in literary fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.In one way or another, my love of literature and my   study of Comp Lit have informed all of the career choices I have made  since  graduation and many of the non-career choices as well. Shortly  after I graduated in 2007, I  took a job working as the sole editor of a  community newspaper where I reported  and wrote stories of local  interest, edited the paper, did the layout and  pagination, and  basically had the chance to complete all the tasks for a small  weekly. I  worked there for about  two years and then returned to school to earn a  Masters degree in English and  Comp Lit at Columbia, thinking I might  want to follow an academic path and  interested in exploring further  some of the subjects I began studying in  college. I graduated with my  M.A.  this past spring and, still uncertain about whether to continue  for a Ph.D., I  did a course in book, magazine and online publishing at  Columbia this  summer. This led to the job in  publishing I have now.When I was deciding what degree I should undertake in   college, I had a moment where I thought I might be a political science  and  philosophy double concentrator.  After I decided to study  comparative literature and philosophy (jokes  about future joblessness  abounded) it seemed strange to me that I had ever  doubted going in this  direction. I  have always loved to read and write and every serious job  I have had after  Brown has involved these activities in some way or  another. I took seriously and still remember  what Professor Viswanathan  said at our graduation ceremony; she called Comp Lit  concentrators  “connoisseurs of the human imagination and the human  spirit.” I have  kept that in mind  ever since and tried to pursue diverse activities  that would cultivate and  enrich that budding connoisseurship.  What’s  more, I still remember and think about many things my literature   professors at Brown said, discussions we had, books we read, ideas they   inspired. This wide-ranging degree  gave me, as David Foster Wallace  once said in a terrific commencement speech at  Kenyon, not just the  ‘tools for thought,’ as we are so often told, but also  things to think  about--places to productively and enjoyably direct my mind and,   hopefully, areas to make some useful contribution.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Don’t believe that your degree is ‘useless,’ certainly not   intellectually or spiritually but not in a practical sense either. The  world--working and otherwise--needs  deep, rigorous, and skeptical  thinkers, critics who can intelligently and  inventively engage with  ideas new and old, who analyze incisively, and who read  well and write  expressively--skills you develop as a student of  literature. We also  need people to  thoughtfully bring to bear the vast knowledge and wisdom  that can be gathered  from books--as well as the attitude of measured  reflection that they so often  promote--to the broad spectrum of human  problems. I would simply say don’t rush to make up your mind about   ‘what to do with your life’ or automatically decide to go to law school  even if  you suspect you don’t really want to solely because it seems  like a more  sensible career path. If you  cherished your time as a  student of literature at Brown and the study of books  itself, know that  you can usefully apply it in more ways than you may imagine  right now  for the betterment of yourself and others. In answer to the question  ‘what can you do with a degree in  comp lit’ I would say you can do  anything you like; or, more to the point, it  is a meaningful  preparation for almost anything you might want to do. *Class of ’07.So many fond memories! It’s a pleasure to  complete the survey, and if I can be  helpful in the future I’d love to  be--let me know what I can do! I would also love to hear what other   alumni are up to, if it’s possible to send that information around at  some  point.I am an associate literary agent at a small agency   called Georges Borchardt, Inc., where we work with French publishers and  their  books as well as with English-language authors. I sold my first  book this year, a beautiful and disturbing  novel by a really promising  young author (can you tell I’m proud?) and I work  with authors I  studied and studied under at Brown. I also try to sell translation  rights in our books to  publishers abroad.My degree brought me to the job I took here, and   passion for it--I use critical reading skills all day long, and I read a   tremendous amount. It’s a lot like  what I was doing at Brown (but now  sometimes authors take my advice! Not that I don’t still take theirs!).I think mine might not have been the path to millions   of dollars, but I’m very happy to use the skills I learned from  comparative  literature on a daily basis--I feel like I’m a literary  person because of the thoughtful and exciting  reading (and writing  about it) I did at Brown. I also think my understanding of literature  and of the  importance of intertextual and intercultural exchange that  my studies afforded  me allows a uniquely wide understanding of the way  things work in our world.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Do a thesis, and I recommend the translation option--it was  a  wonderful project I’m so glad I completed. And also take an economics  class! *Class of ’05.I am in a great place now, but it has taken a  lot of  effort to be here. I have been living in London for the last 5  years.  I graduated in 2004 with degrees in both Economics and Comp.  Lit.  Upon graduation I found it very difficult to get hired, but I  understand  it is always difficult to get your first job. My first job  was in New  York, working in a very big and international advertising  agency, but I  couldn’t remain in Madison Avenue because I am Colombian  and I needed a visa to  be able to stay. International graduates that  had been hired in the banking  industry were luckier getting their visas  extended. Nevertheless, I was  lucky to have a Dutch passport and so I  packed my bags and went to London. When I got to London in the fall of   2005, the City was buzzing with activity and after three months I was  hired to  work in a small corporate communications agency specialised in  helping  companies float on the London Stock Exchange and the  Alternative Investment  Market (AIM). I learned about financial PR and  corporate communications  and learned about IPO’s, M&A and the  financial calendar. The City of  London continues to be one of those  places dominated by Brits and boys clubs,  and I believe it was a huge  achievement to be the only foreign Spanish-speaking  female employee,  who spoke English as a second language. After a year  working in this  agency, I was hired to work at Brunswick Group, the biggest and  most  important corporate communications company out there. I left  financial  PR a year ago, and now I am concentrating in starting my own company  in  the beverages industry, following my father’s footsteps.London is a very competitive place, and one of the  most  important assets you can bring to a firm are your language skills.   Studying Comp. Lit in three languages gave me an advantage over all  other  applicants. This degree, together with a degree in Economics made  me a  pretty quaint and wholesome hire. It forced me to use different  parts of  my brain, and to think creatively to solve problems others  would find difficult  to tackle. Ultimately I wanted a degree in Human  Nature, which was  exactly what I got at Brown.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  I think students should think hard about what  they really want to BE.  Graduation took me completely by surprise and I  was running around  trying to get a job without having really reached inside to  determine  my core ambitions. Looking back, I know I am exactly where I need to   be, and all my steps have taught me very valuable lessons. My advice   would be to continue thinking about what you want to be, and work hard  at becoming  that. My other advice is to enjoy your academic experience  as much as you can,  because you will never get these years back. Do  what you enjoy the most.  If you do something because you think the  degree looks good on paper, you  will be thoroughly disappointed at  yourself for wasting time better invested in  something you are  passionate about. Life is very short, and the real  world is extremely  humbling.  *Class of ’04.It's great that you are undertaking this  project for  Brown Comp. Lit. undergrads. I'll try to follow the general  question guideline  you've given us, but my answers do tend to be a bit  freeform as well.I didn't know this field even existed before starting   as an undergrad at Brown. It  sounds unfocused, but the truth is that I  concentrated in Comparative  Literature because I felt that Brown's  Comp. Lit. department had the best  professors and the most interesting  classes at the entire university. Every semester as I thumbed through  the  course catalog (which even as a relatively recent graduate no doubt  dates me)  those were always the courses I wanted to take.After I graduated from Brown, everyone asked me if I   wanted to work at a publishing company.  I guess most people think that  line of work is a natural choice for  people who love books, and --  needing a job and with a nascent sense of what I  wanted anyway--I  indeed ended up with a marketing associate job at a  family-owned  publisher in New York City.  I worked with many, many wonderful people  who loved books, but my heart  wasn't really in the work.Two years later I moved to San Francisco, where I   actually used the Brown Alumni Network to set up a bunch of  informational  interviews with local graduates doing work that sounded  interesting. Of the six or seven that I emailed, two  got back to me,  both of whom provided a lot of interesting insight in to their  work. Of  the two that got back to  me, one--who owned a firm that designed  products to help enhance our urban  forest and offered sustainable  landscape design services--was in need of some  extra help. I started  work there  on a trial basis writing all of the materials for their  products, website, and  more. After about three weeks they  brought me  on full time. I have a  hard time believing this myself, but I'm still  there! I love working for a small company, and I have truly   extraordinary co-workers--kind, sincere, warm people. I also write for  several websites in my spare time,  researching and discussing topics  related to animal welfare and wildlife.It sounds trite to say, but Comparative Literature   informed my life after Brown mostly through the valuation and  exploration of  ideas. No doubt the things that I love about Comp.  Lit.--reading, ideas,  analysis--will always be a part of me, and  hopefully they will always inform  the work that I do as well.As for advice for Comparative Literature students now   at Brown, I would say simply to work hard and to look for all the  things that  you value about the Comp. Lit. field in the world outside  the university. When I was a student, I thought a lot  about it strictly  as it related to books. The next step, I think, is bringing  that  analysis, that interest in cross-pollination, that unpacking and  repacking  of ideas--to whatever you pursue.  *Class of ’04.Thank you for your email. It is so nice to hear  from you! I think this project is an excellent idea and hope that my   answers to your questions (please see below) will be helpful.I currently live in the Boston area and work for a  market research company that hosts online surveys.Upon graduation I moved to Madrid, Spain, where I   worked for a study abroad program for two years. When I returned to the  US I worked for a year at a large,  Boston-based publisher, providing  bilingual marketing and sales support to a  team of over twenty sales  representatives in Latin America and the  Caribbean. At the time, social   media was growing in popularity and I decided to follow the trend. I  took a position at a company  specializing in online focus groups, where  I worked for two years. I recently started a position at a  market  research company that hosts online surveys and recruits survey   respondents.It may sound cliché but the world really is getting   smaller. In my current role I work  with people from very diverse  backgrounds and I must interact with them in a  culturally sensitive  way. Studying  Comparative Literature exposed me to other cultures and  value systems and  taught me to value and respect them.On a more personal note, I studied Spanish as my   foreign language for Comparative Literature and studied abroad in Spain.  I enjoyed my time in Spain so much that  I decided to work in Madrid  after graduation. While working in Madrid I met the man who eventually  became  my husband.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  The old adage is true: it’s who you know not what you  know. My advice  is: network,  network, NETWORK! I have found all  of my jobs through  networking. I  conducted informational interviews, went to industry  events and talked to as  many people as possible. I have  also made sure  to help others as well, by offering advice to current and former  Brown  students. I recommend that  Brown students and alumni take advantage of  BRUnet, the Brown alumni  database. A number of Brown  students have  contacted me through this network and I am always happy to speak  with  them. *Class of ’05.Thanks for your message, it's great to hear  from the  Comp. Lit. department. I have kept up with a few of my  professors at  Brown, especially Prof. Weinstein, but good to hear from  the department.I would be happy to respond to the questions--it does   strike as a particularly relevant point of discussion to Comp. Lit.  majors, who  fall somewhat outside of the traditional spectrum of  professionally-oriented  concentrations.1) I currently work for an entrepreneurial education   technology firm called ConnectEDU, which is geared towards easing the  high  school-to-college-to-career transition process. The firm is  approximately  50 employees, and in our 8th year we are making some  great strides in the  government solutions space, in particular the  various statewide longitudinal  data systems grants funded through Race  to the Top. I work in the product  development group, where much of my  work involves writing technical  requirements--detailed documentation of  how software should function under  various potential scenarios.2) My first step off of College Hill landed me at   Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, as an English instructor. I was   able to take some graduate business courses while teaching, and of  course was  able to travel extensively. I would say that Comp. Lit.  fostered a spirit  of inquiry, encouraging me to do something  adventurous.In terms of what the degree means for my professional   life, much of what I do is a function of persuasive, clear, and concise   communication. Writing is a skill that will always be in demand in the   workplace, and Comp. Lit. gave me a fluency as a writer that is a  constant  boon. My career path has been a product both of my studies and   accompanying experiences and relationships. I would say that looking  at  the degree as a set of skills--rather than a set of knowledge or  expertise--is  a great way to get started in the job search.3) Comparative Literature emphasizes above all else  the  depths of meaning that can be found in the unobserved and  overlooked details of  life. Cultivating a curiosity gives me a greater  sense of connection to  my peers and my surroundings, and leads me to  explore without a sense of  judgment or precondition. That may sound a  bit whimsical, but it's also a  valuable asset in my current line of  work.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Enjoy your studies and time at Brown, there's no  place like it on  Earth. But even as you make the most of it, take some  time to look  around at the world beyond before you're marching out the  gates. My  summer experiences--and  a part-time job during the academic  year--turned out to be very influential on  my career path. Reaching out  to recent alumni in various fields--BEFORE  you need a job--is a great  way to build a network. Brown alumni are  amazingly eager to help out,  most of the time. *Class of ’07.I am now in Boston, working in Business development for  a software company that builds language learning programs.I have been working primarily in business and education  since Brown.Language and literature have remained big parts of my   life, and I’ve appreciated the foundation in these things that I gained  at  Brown.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Get a summer internship or a different one each year. I think  internships are a critical way  to build “real world” skills and  experiences. These skills and experiences are especially important for   Comp Lit people and can be a great way to round out one’s resume and set   oneself up for success post-graduation.  *Class of ’04.Sorry for my delayed reply. Glad that  you will be providing this to students; it seems  like a resource I  would have loved to see while an undergrad as well. My answers are  below.I am currently working as a research associate for a  sexuality education project at the Public Health Institute in Oakland, CA.I took a somewhat alternative route after finishing my   comp lit degree--I worked during the summer before graduation as an  editorial  intern at South End Press, a radical political publishing  company then based  out of Cambridge, MA. Following  graduation,  however, I worked in HIV prevention programs in Boston, then moved  to  Berkeley to pursue a master’s in public health.While my work post-Brown has been in the public health   field, I strongly believe that my comp lit background has been a huge  asset in  my professional, academic, and personal life. Studying comp  lit at Brown made me a better and more  efficient writer as well as a  more critical reader of research. I also feel that it deepened my   appreciation for and understanding of literature, which feeds my  continued love  of reading in my own time.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Go abroad! And  don’t worry if your studies don’t seem to track  directly to a certain  profession--I chose comp lit because I loved the  courses, and while they are by  no means connected to the work I am  doing now, they still provided me with a  skillset that helps me in my  daily work.  *Class of ’05.This year I am working full time on a  CSA farm called  Chubby Bunny in Falls Village, CT and in the years to  come I am hoping to  integrate food justice/food access work on my own  small farm for people who  don’t have the money or the means to buy  locally grown vegetables.My senior year I did a translation project that led me   to a trip to Mexico to work with the poet and I spend a month with her  at her  house. That project landed me in an  issue of the Denver Quarterly and on online literary mag called Fascicle.[How has the study of Comparative Literature  informed  your life after Brown?]  Literature IS life. I was  exposed to thinkers  and writers who continue to shape/shift my thoughts and  understandings  about the world around me and beyond me. Also, it really improved my  Spanish  skills and helped in the work I have done in the Latino  communities and with  Spanish-speaking students in the U.S.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  My friend Rachel used to wear a pin that was handed down to  her from  her father that said something like, “If it feels good, I’ll do it.”That’s how I think about my degree. It felt good to  enjoy ALL the courses  in my concentration and because of the relatively  low number of required  courses I was able to enjoy classes in dance,  art, religion philosophy and  biology. Furthermore, since my  courses  were not as intensive I had ample opportunity to work in the community   at Hope High School and in the community garden at UEL, where a  different kind  of education took place for me. It  was outside the  classroom that my deepest learning happened through my  relationships  with the people in Providence and through my explorations of the  world  around me. *Class of ’05.[Where are you now?] Washington, DC.  I  am a senior analyst at The Advisory Board Company, a consulting firm   serving the healthcare and higher education sectors. I conduct best  practice research in topics pertinent to  hospital management and  leadership--and design training and development  workshops that are  conducted on-site at roughly 1000 member hospitals and  health systems.[Where did your degree in Comparative Literature   lead?] A broad question. It led me, first, to spend my final  semester  of undergrad abroad--studying at the Sorbonne in Paris (although I   focused more on European politics and Italian cinema than on French  literature,  ironically). Then, perhaps  elaborating on a theme of life  in translation, or comparative 20-something  experience, I moved to  Tokyo and spent a few months running my own ebay  business, selling  Japanese products to American collectors and learning to cook  Japanese  cuisine. This was  followed by my first "real job," when I joined a  small nonprofit  dedicated to biodiversity conservation in Costa Rica.  There, I learned Spanish,  wrote grants, website copy, newsletters,  donor outreach materials, etc, and  conducted fundraising presentations.   Finally, I moved to the consulting firm where I currently work, doing   research and program design.[How has the study of Comparative Literature informed   your life after Brown?] In many  ways. The almost mechanical skills   that you develop by taking a slew of comparative literature courses--  how to  closely read and analyze a text, how to think critically about a  subject before  you, how to re-think and question your own assumptions  about a text, how to  construct and argument, how to write  clearly--although it's almost a cliché to  point out, all of these are  directly relevant to just about any kind of work  that you might do  after college.  So I would say, my Comp lit education has served me very  well--not so  much via the content that I learned but more from the  methodologies that I  practiced.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  I would just reiterate a message you hear  regularly as a student, but  may not feel able to completely trust--like any of  the humanities  degrees, a degree in Comparative Literature prepares you well  for life  after college. Thinking  critically, communicating, researching,  understanding and appreciating  divergent perspectives, seeing between  the lines--these are the skills you need  to succeed. Dig deeply into  the  areas of study that you find most fascinating, now, and be  confident that you  will emerge from university with a strong foundation  for anything you should  choose to do next--from law to banking to  consulting to teaching to journalism  to administration . . . and  beyond.  *Class of ’04.I am a second year pediatric resident at Children’s  Hospital Boston.In some ways, you could say my degree in Comparative   Literature has not contributed directly to my career path. It was not a  requirement for medical  school, nor for residency. Yet it  has  benefited me hugely in my work: the same focus on word choice,   communication, perspective, history, meaning and interpretation that led  me to  Comp Lit has served me well in medicine.  It informs how I  communicate with my patients and their parents.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Challenge yourself to make your course of study rigorous and  broad.  Take courses with varied  class sizes, varied formats, and with an eye  to themes that cross disciplines. Get to know your professors, TA’s, and   colleagues. Seek out young  alums. Learn to be a scholar both  singly  and in a group setting.  People who are successful at their endeavors  and passionate about their  work do find jobs! *Class of ’04.[Where are you now?] Salt Lake City, UT.  Moving to Ashland, OR this coming spring.[Where did your degree in Comparative Literature   lead?] To medical school at  Oregon Health Sciences University in  Portland, OR. I have since entered residency, training to be an  Emergency  Medicine physician. I am chief  resident, and will be  graduating this spring.I consider myself a “well-rounded” physician, able to   relate to and communicate with both my patients and my colleagues. I am  constantly complimented on my  “documentation” and charting, and  believe that my education in Comparative  Literature enabled me to  continue my proficiency in Spanish, which I use  clinically on a daily  basis.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  The only advice I have comes from my mom, who advised me  when I was  deciding my concentration.  These days, many professionals go on to  pursue graduate degrees and when  it comes to admission to these higher  education programs, the specific area of  concentration as an  undergraduate seems not to matter very much. Your undergraduate  education should be  for you. Choose something  you enjoy and are  passionate about and you will learn to think critically and  be  inspired. These skills will  stay with you in whatever you do after  Brown. *Class of ’04.I am in Massachusetts, in the final year of a PhD  program in Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard.[Where did your degree in Comparative Literature  lead?] Where didn’t my degree in Comparative Literature lead?  This is a challenging  question to answer only because Comparative  Literature is so deeply  intertwined with every part of my intellectual and  professional life.  Through an  extraordinary advisor (Professor Viswanathan), Comparative  Literature led me to  pursue biology and neuroscience.  It gave me space  to begin interdisciplinary work linking the analysis of  literary texts  with biological information about the human body and its  progress  through the life course.  It gave me the tools to make a case for myself  as a graduate student in  human evolutionary biology. It  also nurtured  the practice of foreign languages that allowed me to biological  field  work in both Argentina (Spanish) and The Gambia (Mandinka).Since Brown, I have maintained contact with advisors  in  Comparative Literature, consulting with them as I develop a project  in  evolution and literature.  Professor Weinstein granted me the  privilege of giving a lecture in one  of his courses. Now I am designing   a postdoctoral fellowship position focusing on adolescence, the area  I’ve  researched in a population of Gambian subsistence  agriculturalists,  incorporating biological data with analysis of  literature from 20th-century  novels to Shakespeare.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Take note of what sorts of thinking and knowledge bring you  the  greatest pleasure and sense of curiosity. What feels like a satisfying  explanation? What do you like to read? What kinds of conversations leave  you  wanting more? If you think  associatively, let the connections  that arise for you take shape, even when  they look different from any  sort of connection you’ve encountered before. Mine the areas of  dissonance, surprise,  and discomfort. *Class of ’05.Delighted to be involved in this! Here are my answers (they are all quite  linked, so I didn’t separate them):I am currently pursuing a PhD at Princeton in the   Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, writing a dissertation  on  Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. I was a  double-concentrator in Slavic and  Comp Lit and the two definitely directed my  post-Brown steps. I spent  the  first year after graduation on a Fulbright in Russia studying art  history. Then I read for my MPhil at Cambridge  in the Modern and  Medieval Languages department in a program called “European  Literatures  and Cultures.” For  those first two years I went back and forth about  whether I wanted to go in  Slavic or Comp Lit and I feel really luck to  have had both options open to  me. I am glad not only to have  done  Slavic because my Comp Lit background made me think more broadly about   literature across languages and national boundaries. My only advice  would be to do what you love. You can never know what opportunities   will appear later. The point of a  liberal arts education is not to be  pragmatic: it’s to make your mind a more  interesting place to live in.  Comp  Lit can do that like nothing else.  *Class of ’05.Right now I’m in Los Angeles in a graduate creative  writing program. I also teach  freshman composition.After college I moved to L.A. to work in film. My  Comparative Literature degree was  helpful in getting me jobs because it  told interviewers that I understood how  story structure works, I like  to read, and I had a good background knowledge of  literature and  movies.Majoring  in comp lit led me to the study of languages  at Brown. I’m fluent in French, proficient in  Spanish, and have a  reading knowledge of ancient Greek. The Spanish comes in helpful in Los   Angeles. The Greek, not so much.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators: 1. If you’re  planning to go to graduate school:  a. Don’t  go right away. Take time off. Doesn’t matter if you’re doing  an MFA  in fiction, a PhD or an MA, get some real world experience  doing  something. If you want to write,  in particular, it’s a good idea  to get a job, so you have something to  say. If you’re going for  something  more academic, try spending time in another country for a  year if that’s a  possibility. Just do something, so  that when you  start your applications you can really be sure about why you want  to  go, and what you want to do there.  That said, it’s probably not a good  idea to take more than two-three  years off between college and graduate  school, if it’s something you’re sure  you want to do.b. A  Comparative Literature B.A. doesn’t necessarily  lead to a Comp Lit Ph.D. English is a possibility as are Gender   Studies, French, Spanish, Classics, African-American studies, etc. . . .  the  market for Comp Lit Ph.D.’s is tough right now, and it’s really  important to be  aware of that. Go into a field  you’re passionate  about, but make sure you’re keeping the reality of the job  market in  mind. People who get  hired tend to have some research that’s off the  beaten path under their belt.c. Do a  thesis, even though it isn’t required.   You’ll gain invaluable research skills and, even if you don’t decide to   go to graduate school, you’ll have graduated with honors and that’s a  good  thing to have on your résumé.  *Class of ’07.I  chose to study Comparative  Literature at Brown because my personal and  professional interests lie  in opening channels of communication within and  across cultures and  communities. I  currently work as an Adult Educator--a profession I  discovered my love for as a  volunteer during my four years in  Providence--teaching ESOL to adults from all  over Latin America at a  grassroots, immigrant-rights organization in New York  City called Make  the Road NY (a name serendipitously inspired by the Antonio  Machado  poem I studied as a freshman at Brown).Naturally,  my languages (Spanish and Portuguese) are  helpful in this field on a day-to-day  level as I relate to my students  and help them connect to legal, health and  community-organizing  opportunities outside of class. And sharing the intricacies (as well as  nonsensities) of  English with dozens of endlessly eager, generous  students every day is entirely  animating.But  beyond the language piece alone, I'm especially  compelled by the connection  between language and the carving out of a  just place for oneself in the  world. I am continually inspired  in the  classroom as students work together--against countless barriers--to live   with dignity in a new language and in a new community. Though not  directly related to  literature, my profession is influenced by the  study of literary and artistic  expressions across cultural distances,  and deeply shaped by the desire to  create spaces of connection across  such distances.Even  before arriving at my current position, the  “comparatist” mindset has pushed me  in other, more unexpected ways, to  explore the means in which authentic,  meaningful communication can  occur across seemingly uncrossable lines. After completing my Senior  Thesis in  translation and graduating in the spring of 2007, I was  thrilled to have the  opportunity to spend a year in São Paulo, Brazil  on a Fulbright scholarship.Compelled  by my studies in Comp Lit to explore the  connections between visual and  language arts, I decided to embark on a  study about the use of photography and  visual literacy as a tool for  social inclusion in popular education  settings. Though I knew before   going to Brazil thatI would be actively involved in the work of Alfabetização Visual, a  local NGO whose  name translates as “Visual Literacy,” what I didn't  know was that I would be  helping to coordinate, design and implement a  year-long photography course for  blind and visually impaired teenagers  and adults.Working  with these students to learn to rely on other  senses to “read” visual material  and “write” their own images with  digital cameras was both challenging and  hugely motivating. The process  involved not only learning to carefully  frame each photograph as  desired--paying attention to exposure, composition and  angle--but also  learning to frame ideas and opinions in this new visual language,  so  that students could then share their personal view of the world with a   larger audience at an accessible, interactive public exhibition.The  depth of this experience not only reinforced my  identity as an educator today,  but also immensely enhanced my respect  for different ways of looking at the  world, and for all those who, by  choice or by circumstance, see it in another  light. My only advice to  current  Comparative Literature students is to push your understanding  of what it means  to be a comparatist. Try out  different lenses as you  look at our linguistic and literary interests and their  relationship to  the world around you.  *Class of ’07.It was so nice to be contacted without being asked for  money. I’ve inserted my answers  below.I am teaching English Language Learners at a small,  public high school in Canarsie, Brooklyn.A number of my students have arrived here from Haiti   over the last year, and while I wasn’t expecting to use my foreign  language background  as a high school teacher, it has been invaluable to  be able to speak French  with my students. Before I took on  my present  position, my comparative literature background propelled me into   teaching literature to high school freshmen.Working with students from a range of cultural and   ethnic backgrounds, I try to approach teaching with a mind to the theory  I  encountered throughout Brown.  Systems of education often ask  teachers to be reductive in how they view  and treat students, but my  experience in comparative literature reminds me to  try to resist those  tendencies.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Consider teaching in the public school system, because you  can bring  the kind of close consideration of diverse stories that happens in  comparative  literature classes at Brown to students who may have been  denied such  experiences. *Class of ’04.It is great to hear from you! I am  happy to share some of my post-Brown and post-comp lit  experiences. It  is interesting to  reflect because I find myself more and more realizing  that I am doing things  more closely related to and "using" my comp lit  study and coursework,  perhaps making my way along the path of putting  it all together. I am in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaIn the first couple of years after graduation I found   myself thinking that I was not doing much very related to comp lit, and  while I  thought about going back for further study in the area, was  not sure I wanted  to take the route of academia and that my study at  Brown had really been an  (intellectually indulgent and thoroughly  enjoyable!) focus on one of my  passions, literature. I had also  been  for the past few years very inclined towards education and had been  volunteering  teaching English in Spain and Olneyville, RI, and after  school I worked for 2  years with a group of charter schools in  under-served communities in the SF Bay  Area, though I was grant writing  and copy editing rather than teaching. This time was interesting and   developmental and really made me want to pursue teaching, so I got  certified to  teach English and moved to New York where I taught ESL for  two years to adult  immigrant populations. I loved (and continue to  love!) teaching, and I  certainly think that my comp lit education and  Brown education in general has  informed and influenced my inclination  towards languages, literature and  teaching, and certainly helped to  refine some of the skills I work with in  language every day. In New  York I  started teaching a literature class to advanced language  students, which was an  amazing and fulfilling uniting of two passions! I  am now teaching ESL/EFL in Buenos Aires and also teaching  literature,  which brings me more and more to the feeling that I am indeed  "using"  my comp lit degree (apart from the obvious of what I gained  from  it--thinking, reading, critical analysis, and exposure to literature,   cultures and histories).Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Study what really attracts you--we all study  literature because of a  certain love for it, and for the insights we can gain  into other eras,  places, peoples, political and cultural movements, and of  course  humanity as its own sometimes overwhelming topic! Do not worry too much   about what exactly you will do after Brown or how exactly you will  apply your  comp lit degree. Even if one were  to go into finance or  chemistry, for example, our lives and minds will have  been enriched by  our comp lit study, and this will never cease to inform our  further  pursuits. Take advantage  of the wealth of knowledge, insight and  resources you have at your fingertips  in your professors! You will only   wish after Brown that you had talked to them more, picked their  brains, and  engaged in more lively discussions.  Do not feel too young  or intimidated or unprepared/ignorant about a  topic to explore a theme  and enter into discussion with professors, and ask  questions! The  beauty of  literature is that we as readers each create our own  realities and truths about  it as we explore and question what we read,  and we each inform the text in a  unique way, so there are not "correct"  answers! This is something I am learning through  teaching literature .  . . I as the professor am not the ultimate authority--I  lead students  through a reading and analysis, but students always bring new  things to  the table, and I believe that even the most schooled and well read   veteran professor will question a work the way we all do . . . so  believe in  your ideas and your own discoveries in your quest as you  study literature. *Class of ’06.[Where are you now?] Boston, MA.I am currently the lead teacher of the humanities at a   private, tuition-free middle school in Dorchester, MA. After  graduating from Brown with my  degree in Comp. Lit. I started teaching  English, and fell in love with the  profession. I might have initially   started teaching because I wanted to share my love of literature with a  younger  generation, but it soon became about providing educational  opportunity and  challenging my students to be better readers, writers,  and thinkers. I went on to earn a master’s degree in  Education at  Harvard Graduate School of Education. In my current position, I do a  mixture of teaching,  curriculum design, and professional development  for new teachers.I teach literature and writing, but I also supervise   social studies, language, comparative religion and arts classes.  Although my Comparative literature  degree gave me specific knowledge  and understanding in my literary and creative  areas of interest, I was  also given a picture of the broader creative and  historical context in  which a work was created. The interdisciplinary and thematic approach to  many of my  classes at Brown influenced how I think about curriculum,  within a class and  within an entire school. I should  also mention that  the classes I took in Comp. Lit. challenged me to think  critically  about who I am and what I will be in the world--without the   self-shaping reflection I went through in those classes, I would not be  the  person I am today.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Try lots of different classes--even things you wouldn’t  expect to be  interested in. Take a  leap of faith and go somewhere unfamiliar after  graduation--don’t go home. Teach, just try it. Repay the privilege of  education that  has been given to you at Brown.  *Class of ’05.I currently live in San Francisco  where I work for  Teach For America as a program director, coaching  teachers across the Bay Area  as they work to close the achievement gap  in their classrooms.Leaving Brown, I was eager to engage in work outside   the academy, and to have a social impact.  This drew me to teaching and  to Teach For America. While my knowledge about literature  hasn’t played  a great role in my years as a young professional, the way I was   trained and nurtured to think as a student of comp lit certainly has.  Brown’s courses in comp lit encouraged  me to think both expansively and  sharply about language, arguments, and art. That disciplined yet  creative thinking  has proven invaluable for a classroom teacher and  problem solver working to  provide an equally rigorous education to  students perpetually failed by our  education system.Comp lit made me brave about making unlikely   connections. This shows up in the  ways I think and speak, in the risks I  choose to take, in my imagination. I value this immensely.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators: This is a broad field;  choosing a focus can be wise and satisfying. *Class of ’05.I am a high school English teacher at  Brookline High  School in Massachusetts. I teach  10th, 11th, and 12th  grade classes in an alternative program called Opportunity  for Change,  which serves students who have not been successful in the  mainstream  high school. My experience as a Writing Fellow at Brown interested   me in education. After graduating,  I served as a college advisor in a  Providence high school through an AmeriCorps  program called the College  Advising Corps. I then decided I wanted to teach and went to the  Harvard  Grad School of Education to get my Master’s degree and teaching   certificate. I just started  teaching English in Brookline this fall.As a teacher of literature, I find it very important   that students use literature as a way to see from multiple perspectives,  which  I think was an important component of Comparative Literature.  The reason I chose it over an English  major was that I did not want to  limit myself to the study of British and  American literature and was  interested in the points of view that  cross-cultural comparison opens  up.  *Class of ’08.I graduated '07 with a degree in Comp  Lit in English  and One Foreign Language (French) and a double major in  the History of  Art. To take the questions one by one:I am currently living in Paris, doing my Master's at   the Université de Paris VII in Cinema Studies. I've been living here for  two years; before that, I worked  at an art gallery in New York. I also  write short stories (in English) and have  had eight published since  graduation.Though I am not working directly in a  "literary"  field, the kind of theory I studied in Comp Lit certainly  informs my  current studies (and will continue to do so as I begin my doctorate   next year). In addition, studying Comp Lit allowed me to achieve a level   of fluency in French that led to my acceptance in my current program,  as well  as a deeper familiarity with French literature and cinema.I would advise current Comp Lit students to balance  out  the CL department's offerings with deeper explorations of related  fields; it's  an interesting discipline in that it is most valuable when  combined with an  in-depth knowledge of one or two particular subjects  (such as Modern Literature,  French literature, etc). Let the CL  department lead you to the kind of  framework in which you can explore  other subjects you've studied in greater  depth. *Class of ’07.Thanks for the email, and best of luck  to everyone in  the Comp Lit department. My time  at Brown was  something I'll always be grateful for, and I feel so privileged to  have  been a part--and to still be part, albeit from a distance--both of the  Brown  community and of the community in the Comparative Literature  department. Below are some short answers about life  as a Comp Lit alum.I'm a playwright finishing my MFA in playwriting (this  spring!) at the University of Iowa Playwrights Workshop.After I graduated in 2006, I spent the summer in New   York working on a play of mine which was produced in the NYC  International  Fringe festival, then moved to Japan where I taught  English and trained martial  arts. Finishing my contract in  Japan, I  traveled in Asia and North Africa, eventually moving back to the US to   get my MFA at the playwrights Workshop.  Over the past two and a half  years I've been developing plays in Iowa,  New York, New Mexico, and  have been in and out of Japan since I left. I received a grant this past  summer to  return to Japan and interview South African expats for a new  play about  immigration and assimilation in Japan, which I'm currently  writing.I was always interested in international literature,   global perspectives, and multilingual texts. My comparative literature  degree allowed me to embrace these  interests to the fullest, honed my  writing skills, and exposed me to entire bodies of work by  writers in  all disciplines that I might never have discovered on my own. I'm  currently studying Arabic, an  interest that was sparked by a Comp Lit  class years ago in which we read North African and  Palestinian works.  As a playwright, my trade is to be interested in everything  and to  search for underlying stories everywhere. Comparative Literature   nourished my hunger for stories and encouraged my ability to analyze and  to  perceive them clearly.On a purely practical note, playwrights and artists  are  required to write grants all the time to pay rent/ make a living/  fund our next  projects. I have a much easier  time with grant-writing  than artist friends of mine who majored in less writing-intensive   disciplines. A degree in Comp Lit  worked better for me than even a  degree in English would have, because of the  focus on exploring and  engaging with international issues through the lens of a  text. This is  what I do in my plays,  and in order to fund my plays, I'm required to  write grants in which I discuss  these issues and my intentions clearly  and in-depth.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Don't let anyone tell you that Comp Lit isn't a  "realistic" degree, or  that you should be majoring in something more  likely to "guarantee you  a stable job." In today's economy, nothing guarantees you a stable  job--but  your passion, your enthusiasm, and your facility at language  and communication  will guarantee you a full and exciting life and will  open up countless  possibilities. With these things  you can go  anywhere, do anything-- teach in America, teach outside the country,   translate, write your own work, become a grantwriter for an arts  organization  or an NGO, the options are endless.  Also--save all the  books and course packets you bought for your comp lit  classes, even the  ones that you didn't read in time. You'll read them later.  Probably  after you graduate.  Maybe when you're living in a rice field and the  only English reading material that you brought with you is  an  inexplicably bilingual manual from the 1980s on How To Operate A   Forklift. Then you'll really  appreciate that previously-untouched  Derrida. *Class of ’06.I am currently living in Cairo, and I  am working 3  part-time jobs, which is frankly too much, but they are  all good learning  experiences so far. I am a  translator for Al Masry Al Youm,  which is a leading independent  newspaper here (I translate articles  from Arabic to English, and occasionally  write culture pieces for their  English edition). I am a Content Producer for Meedan, an online  community for  Arabic-English dialogue and translated current affairs,  and I am also working  as a supervisor/lead cashier at the Egyptian  Museum Gift Shop. Back to what I gained from Brown/Comparative   Literature: Translation. The work  I did in this department helped me  develop my writing and analytical skills,  both of which have been key  in the non-profit writing jobs I worked the first  year and a half after  Brown, and the media jobs I'm working now. My major at Brown led pretty  much  directly to the Fulbright that I got last year to study Arabic  here in  Cairo. Fulbright grants for  language study aren't that common,  you have to make a case that you will do  something worthwhile with  your language skills in order to get it; I made a  case for myself based  on my interest in translating Arabic literature into  English. Comp Lit  work on  Translation also gave me an informed perspective on  intercultural issues, which  is essential for the Meedan job especially,  and for basically everything I've  done in Cairo. Comp Lit also means   developing second-language skills, which are pretty marketable, as well  as  awesome. Naturally language skills  are a huge part of the jobs I'm  doing in Cairo now, although I actually studied  Latin and Greek as an  undergrad.  That aspect I did not carry on with, but it certainly still  contributed  to my career process. And since  I'm talking about the  practical side of things, though I can't use it to get  jobs doing the  kind of translation work I'm doing now, saying you studied Latin  and  Greek does tend to impress people, and that's never a bad thing.Also, it's worth recognizing that it's not just the   in-class activities that count. My  first job out of Brown was a paid  internship for Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival  in the grant-writing  office, and for that it was really important not only that  I had  writing and editing skills, but that I had been involved in the students   arts activities. Likewise on the  Fulbright application, and my  current jobs, I used/referred to writing samples  from the BDH and Indy,  as well as from classes.When I was at Brown, I think I almost willfully  ignored  the jobs question. I thought it  would be almost selling out to  think about careers, that it would sully my  attempts to explore my  interests.  Most likely this is because I imagined working for money and  doing  things you care about to be mutually exclusive pursuits. I also  thought career development was  for future investment bankers only--an  impression that the resources available  at the Career Development  Center sometimes reinforced. Whereas now I tend to think of the  career  question as gradually figuring out what I can do that I consider   valuable and fulfilling, and make enough to live in a way that I feel   comfortable with. The thing with  careers that aren't on the list of  "everyone knows them and considers them  financially viable" jobs, is  that there isn't an obvious, well-known path  to get to them. Which  means that  things like networking, informational interviewing, good old  fashioned asking  around, become much more essential.Really, I think the bottom line is learning how to   search for jobs effectively--how to identify jobs that you are qualified  for  and that interest you, how to present yourself well. Almost no one  graduates college with a degree that directly  translates to a related  job, but by virtue of the work you do and the  activities you're  involved in, you do graduate with usable skills, whether that  is  writing and analytical skills, or research experience, or experience   organizing events, etc. *Class of  ’08.I'm a staff writer at the Washington Post, based in  Washington, DC.I've applied the kind of analysis taught in comp lit   courses at Brown to my work as a journalist. A few months after  finishing  my senior thesis on the literature of the U.S.-Mexico border,  I took a job  reporting on immigration and border security from South  Texas and Northern  Mexico.[Where did your degree in Comparative Literature   lead?] It has  certainly made me a better writer and a more astute  reader--both skills that I  put to use in my current job. My  background  in comparative literature has informed the way I think about  politics  and history, and has piqued a lifelong interest in the interplay   between art and culture.Advice  for present Comp. Lit. concentrators:  Take  advantage of the opportunity to immerse yourself in great  literature, and to  wrestle with texts outside of your comfort zone.  Remember the value of a  close reading, but don't let a focus on  criticism overwhelm your interaction  with a work. Allow yourself  to be  blown away by really great writing, and then return to it again and   again, and try to understand why it was so affecting. *Class of ’07.I just completed a master of  philosophy at the  University of Cambridge. Before my year in England, I  worked for three  years as the Senior Associate Producer of a national  weekly news program on  PBS, called The Bill Moyers Journal. I produced  news segments that  blended breaking news with historical analysis and  investigation of the wider  social impact. My beat focused on national  politics, some stories that I  covered include global financial crisis  and its wider financial fallout,  emergence of healthcare reform, labor,  Congressional ethics, legislative  politics, and media criticism. I am  currently a freelance multi-media  producer and writer working for  diverse network of media houses from MTV to  Huffington Post.com to  advertising consultancy groups. My degree clearly led me to a career in media,   particularly in journalism. But due to my facility with languages and   sharpened analytical skills I have been able to do a range of creative  and  managerial tasks. I know that the cross disciplinary training I  gained as  a comparative literature concentrator provided me with this  critical thinking  skills that have been invaluable in my professional  experience--not to mention  notably prized by all of my employers.  I  also have noted, to be frank, that the kind of broad and yet detailed   thinking that comparative literature training provides has given me a   particular social capital that is shared in the undertone of  contemporary  American white-collar workforce.Being a mid-career professional   who is experiencing the educated workforce squeeze, I know that the  level of my  education at Brown comp lit provided the lateral thinking  skills and the  facility with multidisciplinary/cultural/social issues,  [which have led to] a  professional agility that is necessary to succeed  in today’s working  environment. I argue against the notion that the  humanities do not  provide readily applicable skills to the workplace  because I know that the  critical thinking skills, sophisticated  information processing dexterity,  top-notch writing, language expertise  (etc., etc.) are all the skills that I  have been hired for and were a  direct cause of my concentration in comparative  literature. I would  also like to note that the most important issue  facing college-educated  American employees is the volatility of our  economy. If you are so  specifically trained that you cannot adapt to  rapid changes in the  financial landscape, it is clear that you will be out of a  job. I think  that comparative literature concentration provides a solid  and wide  base of essential skills that will serve you in any profession.  Simply  put comp lit makes you a critical, engaged, intelligent and agile   adapter, which is what every employer is looking for. *Class of ’06.[Top of page]Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownStudents may earn honors in the concentration by successfully presenting a thesis, for the preparation of which they will normally enroll in COLT 1990 in either or both semesters of their senior year.  These courses may not be used to satisfy the standard requirements for a concentration. Honors candidates must also normally earn more A's than B's in courses taken as part of the Comparative Literature concentration (or receive the equivalent faculty evaluation on a Course Performance Report for courses taken S/NC).Students should generally begin thinking about an Honors Thesis in their third year of course work. Students who plan to go abroad in the junior year are advised to give some thought to these matters before leaving; they may also want to write to certain professors from abroad, indicating their potential thesis interests. Optimally, it may be possible to devise a summer reading list for thesis research, so that the project already has some momentum when senior year starts.The Department expects students to have two readers for the honors thesis, and one of them should normally have some connection with the Comparative Literature department. In addition to discussing possible topics and directions for the thesis, students will want to discuss with the faculty person(s) procedural and technical matters as well. In particular, it is necessary to agree on deadlines for completing readings and submitting drafts, on the amount of consultation that is expected, etc. It is important that all parties have a clear sense of these matters. Students planning to do honors theses in the department must submit the titles and abstracts of their projects as well as the names and signatures of their directors and second readers by October 15. (Thesis Proposal form)Most students require two semesters to plan and complete an Honors Thesis. A substantial portion of writing on the thesis must be completed and submitted to the advisor(s) during the Fall semester. The second semester is devoted to completing the writing, and a full draft of the entire thesis must be submitted by March 15. The final complete version of the thesis must be submitted by April 15. Students should submit one copy to each reader and one electronic and one hard copy of the thesis to the Department. Honors in Comparative Literature is granted upon positive recommendation by the thesis advisors. The honors thesis is usually between 50 and 100 pages long. It is anticipated that a significant amount of research will go into this project. Students are expected normally to choose a topic that involves work in each of the foreign literatures they have presented for their degree; such foreign materials are to be dealt with (i.e., read and cited) in the original language, even though the thesis itself is generally written in English. It is also anticipated that the project itself is to be of a comparative nature. In some cases, it may be possible for a student to devise a thesis project that meshes the thesis investigation with creative writing.October 15: Students planning to do honors theses in the department must submit the titles and abstracts of their projects as well as the names and signatures of their directors and second readers.March 15: full draft of the entire thesis must be submitted.April 15: The final complete version of the thesis must be submitted.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
