Modern Handwriting’, ‘Shakespeare in his Time’, ‘Public Sphere in 
Britain’, all well taught.Developing my research and writing skills for a career in academia or teaching.Next year I will be doing the first year of my PhD in the UCL English 
department. I hope to gain experience in tutoring alongside this.Advice would be to tailor the modules to your particular research 
interests. There are a good selection on offer, and lots of scope for 
doing work in a variety of departments with different methodological 
focuses. Make the course as varied and lively as possible!

After choosing predominantly modules on the Early Modern period during my undergraduate studies I decided that there was a lot more to learn. As this MA is interdisciplinary I was able to choose from 40 modules across different departments at UCL; this was particularly useful as my interest lies in Early Modern science. We also had trips to places like the Royal Society, St Brides Library (where they have an actual printing press from the seventeenth century), and the National Archives. I loved learning palaeography; it helps when I look for original research material in manuscripts. I started off very flaky but managed to learn quite a lot in a short space of time. I am planning on doing a PhD in Early Modern literature and its relation to science. The work for the MA, especially the annotated bibliography, helped me shape my research proposal and also secure two PhD places. I cannot express how invaluable this experience was. Do not worry if you don’t know what you will work on just yet. The MA will shape the way you think about the period and there is always something new and exciting to work on.

Code: ARTFGE01AValue: 15 creditsTutor: Taught by a variety of tutors (changes year on year)Time & Location: Term 1, Tuesdays, 2-4pm, use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsOne of the crucial developments of the period we term ‘the Renaissance’ or ‘early modern’ was the rise of a multitude of cultural forms in the vernacular, in contrast to the medieval Latinate world that had gone before. We will look at how these changes developed in different European countries from their origins in Italy to Spain, England and France. As well as charting these key shifts in cultural practice, we incorporate sessions that introduce crucial changes in material practice, focusing on print culture, communication networks, and visual, aural and material culture. These sessions are designed to complement and dialogue with other modules on the MA in Early Modern Studies that develop the necessary skills for carrying out original research for the dissertation and towards doctoral study, i.e. historical bibliography and the study of manuscript material. In addition to weekly seminar discussion, we will visit libraries, archives and sites of special interest including the National Portrait Gallery, and these visits will include sessions on object-based learning.Course handbook 2017-18, containing schedule, reading lists etc (pdf)ARTFGE01A is assessed by one 4,000-word essay on a topic of your choice, to be discussed and agreed with the course convenors. Essays should be submitted via Turnitin on Moodle and are due according to the deadlines set out in the Moodle handbook for the module.

Code: ARTFGE01BValue: 15 creditsTutor: Taught by a variety of tutors (changes year on year)Time & Location: Term 2, Tuesdays, 2-4pm, use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsThis module starts by examining the epistemological challenges that transformed the early modern world from the creation of a global trading system to the cartographic innovations that helped to map it and the travel writing that explored the vastly expanded horizons of early modern European thought. The course focuses on a number of issues in the cultural and intellectual history of the period, as researchers lead sessions demonstrating how the relationship between theory and archival research can result in new insights into the early modern as a critical concept. Field trips which facilitate engagement with material forms and physical practice in the period include the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Society Library.Course handbook 2017-18, containing schedule, reading lists etc (pdf)ARTFGE01B is assessed by an annotated bibliography / literature review (4,000 words long) which can be used to help define and begin to research the topic of the dissertation. Students should discuss their literature reviews with the course convenors or appropriate course tutor. Essays should be submitted via Turnitin on Moodle and are due according to the deadlines set out in the Moodle handbook for the module.

Code: ARTFGE05Value: 15 creditsTutor: Dr Robyn AdamsTime & Location: Mondays, 10-12 noon, term 1. Use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsThis course provides intensive training in the essential skills required for postgraduate research in the period 1500-1800 and focuses mainly on two areas; paleography and book history.The paleography section introduces the handwriting and scripts of early modern England (1500-1800) and manuscript culture. Knowledge of these scripts is essential for students wishing to pursue archival research. In addition, this course provides access to the resources required for archival research, such as provenance markers and situating the source material in its historical context. The book history section is intended as a primer towards advanced bibliographical research and study which focuses on textual history. It equips the student with the resources, methodological questions and techniques required for understanding the historical context and processes of book production in the early modern period. The course combines practical research skills with a program of key areas of historical bibliography and history of reading. The course is practical, and is taught on-site within the UCL Special Collections reading room facilities, using carefully chosen material from the stacks. There are also two field trips to archives and institutions and the opportunity to meet and gain hands-on experience from leading manuscript and textual scholars.This course will be a core module for the MA in Early Modern Studies from September 2018.Assessment: One 4000 word essay (100%)Coursework should be submitted via the Moodle course, and according to the deadlines set out therein.

Use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsIt is a truism that we live in an information society and that this is a new and unprecedented state of affairs. This module seeks to historicise the concept of the information society through the study of the cultural and intellectual history of early modern Europe.The rediscovery and popularisation of classical learning, the explosion of printed material, and the birth of a modern concept of scientiﬁc knowledge presented a challenge to scholars and states across Europe: how to organise, use, and share information in an age where there was – in the words of Ann Blair – “too much to know”.Assessment: One 3000 word essay (100%)Coursework should be submitted via the Moodle course, and according to the deadlines set out therein.

Code: ARTFGE01AValue: 15 creditsTutor: Taught by a variety of tutors (changes year on year)Time & Location: Term 1, Tuesdays, 2-4pm, use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsOne of the crucial developments of the period we term ‘the Renaissance’ or ‘early modern’ was the rise of a multitude of cultural forms in the vernacular, in contrast to the medieval Latinate world that had gone before. We will look at how these changes developed in different European countries from their origins in Italy to Spain, England and France. As well as charting these key shifts in cultural practice, we incorporate sessions that introduce crucial changes in material practice, focusing on print culture, communication networks, and visual, aural and material culture. These sessions are designed to complement and dialogue with other modules on the MA in Early Modern Studies that develop the necessary skills for carrying out original research for the dissertation and towards doctoral study, i.e. historical bibliography and the study of manuscript material. In addition to weekly seminar discussion, we will visit libraries, archives and sites of special interest including the National Portrait Gallery, and these visits will include sessions on object-based learning.Course handbook 2017-18, containing schedule, reading lists etc (pdf)ARTFGE01A is assessed by one 4,000-word essay on a topic of your choice, to be discussed and agreed with the course convenors. Essays should be submitted via Turnitin on Moodle and are due according to the deadlines set out in the Moodle handbook for the module.

Code: ARTFGE05Value: 15 creditsTutor: Dr Robyn AdamsTime & Location: Mondays, 10-12 noon, term 1. Use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsThis course provides intensive training in the essential skills required for postgraduate research in the period 1500-1800 and focuses mainly on two areas; paleography and book history.The paleography section introduces the handwriting and scripts of early modern England (1500-1800) and manuscript culture. Knowledge of these scripts is essential for students wishing to pursue archival research. In addition, this course provides access to the resources required for archival research, such as provenance markers and situating the source material in its historical context. The book history section is intended as a primer towards advanced bibliographical research and study which focuses on textual history. It equips the student with the resources, methodological questions and techniques required for understanding the historical context and processes of book production in the early modern period. The course combines practical research skills with a program of key areas of historical bibliography and history of reading. The course is practical, and is taught on-site within the UCL Special Collections reading room facilities, using carefully chosen material from the stacks. There are also two field trips to archives and institutions and the opportunity to meet and gain hands-on experience from leading manuscript and textual scholars.This course will be a core module for the MA in Early Modern Studies from September 2018.Assessment: One 4000 word essay (100%)Coursework should be submitted via the Moodle course, and according to the deadlines set out therein.

I chose to do the course, because I intend to do a PhD in literary history, and UCL is a fantastic university!Enjoying my thesis so far; also, good selection of modules, ‘Early 
Modern Handwriting’, ‘Shakespeare in his Time’, ‘Public Sphere in 
Britain’, all well taught.Developing my research and writing skills for a career in academia or teaching.Next year I will be doing the first year of my PhD in the UCL English 
department. I hope to gain experience in tutoring alongside this.Advice would be to tailor the modules to your particular research 
interests. There are a good selection on offer, and lots of scope for 
doing work in a variety of departments with different methodological 
focuses. Make the course as varied and lively as possible!

After choosing predominantly modules on the Early Modern period during my undergraduate studies I decided that there was a lot more to learn. As this MA is interdisciplinary I was able to choose from 40 modules across different departments at UCL; this was particularly useful as my interest lies in Early Modern science. We also had trips to places like the Royal Society, St Brides Library (where they have an actual printing press from the seventeenth century), and the National Archives. I loved learning palaeography; it helps when I look for original research material in manuscripts. I started off very flaky but managed to learn quite a lot in a short space of time. I am planning on doing a PhD in Early Modern literature and its relation to science. The work for the MA, especially the annotated bibliography, helped me shape my research proposal and also secure two PhD places. I cannot express how invaluable this experience was. Do not worry if you don’t know what you will work on just yet. The MA will shape the way you think about the period and there is always something new and exciting to work on.

I chose to do the course, because I intend to do a PhD in literary history, and UCL is a fantastic university!Enjoying my thesis so far; also, good selection of modules, ‘Early 
Modern Handwriting’, ‘Shakespeare in his Time’, ‘Public Sphere in 
Britain’, all well taught.Developing my research and writing skills for a career in academia or teaching.Next year I will be doing the first year of my PhD in the UCL English 
department. I hope to gain experience in tutoring alongside this.Advice would be to tailor the modules to your particular research 
interests. There are a good selection on offer, and lots of scope for 
doing work in a variety of departments with different methodological 
focuses. Make the course as varied and lively as possible!

After choosing predominantly modules on the Early Modern period during my undergraduate studies I decided that there was a lot more to learn. As this MA is interdisciplinary I was able to choose from 40 modules across different departments at UCL; this was particularly useful as my interest lies in Early Modern science. We also had trips to places like the Royal Society, St Brides Library (where they have an actual printing press from the seventeenth century), and the National Archives. I loved learning palaeography; it helps when I look for original research material in manuscripts. I started off very flaky but managed to learn quite a lot in a short space of time. I am planning on doing a PhD in Early Modern literature and its relation to science. The work for the MA, especially the annotated bibliography, helped me shape my research proposal and also secure two PhD places. I cannot express how invaluable this experience was. Do not worry if you don’t know what you will work on just yet. The MA will shape the way you think about the period and there is always something new and exciting to work on.

Code: ARTFGE01AValue: 15 creditsTutor: Taught by a variety of tutors (changes year on year)Time & Location: Term 1, Tuesdays, 2-4pm, use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsOne of the crucial developments of the period we term ‘the Renaissance’ or ‘early modern’ was the rise of a multitude of cultural forms in the vernacular, in contrast to the medieval Latinate world that had gone before. We will look at how these changes developed in different European countries from their origins in Italy to Spain, England and France. As well as charting these key shifts in cultural practice, we incorporate sessions that introduce crucial changes in material practice, focusing on print culture, communication networks, and visual, aural and material culture. These sessions are designed to complement and dialogue with other modules on the MA in Early Modern Studies that develop the necessary skills for carrying out original research for the dissertation and towards doctoral study, i.e. historical bibliography and the study of manuscript material. In addition to weekly seminar discussion, we will visit libraries, archives and sites of special interest including the National Portrait Gallery, and these visits will include sessions on object-based learning.Course handbook 2017-18, containing schedule, reading lists etc (pdf)ARTFGE01A is assessed by one 4,000-word essay on a topic of your choice, to be discussed and agreed with the course convenors. Essays should be submitted via Turnitin on Moodle and are due according to the deadlines set out in the Moodle handbook for the module.

Code: ARTFGE01BValue: 15 creditsTutor: Taught by a variety of tutors (changes year on year)Time & Location: Term 2, Tuesdays, 2-4pm, use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsThis module starts by examining the epistemological challenges that transformed the early modern world from the creation of a global trading system to the cartographic innovations that helped to map it and the travel writing that explored the vastly expanded horizons of early modern European thought. The course focuses on a number of issues in the cultural and intellectual history of the period, as researchers lead sessions demonstrating how the relationship between theory and archival research can result in new insights into the early modern as a critical concept. Field trips which facilitate engagement with material forms and physical practice in the period include the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Society Library.Course handbook 2017-18, containing schedule, reading lists etc (pdf)ARTFGE01B is assessed by an annotated bibliography / literature review (4,000 words long) which can be used to help define and begin to research the topic of the dissertation. Students should discuss their literature reviews with the course convenors or appropriate course tutor. Essays should be submitted via Turnitin on Moodle and are due according to the deadlines set out in the Moodle handbook for the module.

Code: ARTFGE05Value: 15 creditsTutor: Dr Robyn AdamsTime & Location: Mondays, 10-12 noon, term 1. Use UCL 'Custom Timetable' to check roomsThis course provides intensive training in the essential skills required for postgraduate research in the period 1500-1800 and focuses mainly on two areas; paleography and book history.The paleography section introduces the handwriting and scripts of early modern England (1500-1800) and manuscript culture. Knowledge of these scripts is essential for students wishing to pursue archival research. In addition, this course provides access to the resources required for archival research, such as provenance markers and situating the source material in its historical context. The book history section is intended as a primer towards advanced bibliographical research and study which focuses on textual history. It equips the student with the resources, methodological questions and techniques required for understanding the historical context and processes of book production in the early modern period. The course combines practical research skills with a program of key areas of historical bibliography and history of reading. The course is practical, and is taught on-site within the UCL Special Collections reading room facilities, using carefully chosen material from the stacks. There are also two field trips to archives and institutions and the opportunity to meet and gain hands-on experience from leading manuscript and textual scholars.This course will be a core module for the MA in Early Modern Studies from September 2018.Assessment: One 4000 word essay (100%)Coursework should be submitted via the Moodle course, and according to the deadlines set out therein.

This module seeks to historicise the concept of the information society through the study of the cultural and intellectual history of early modern Europe.The rediscovery and popularisation of classical learning, the explosion of printed material, and the birth of a modern concept of scientiﬁc knowledge presented a challenge to scholars and states across Europe: how to organise, use, and share information in an age where there was – in the words of Ann Blair – “too much to know”.Assessment: One 3000 word essay (100%)Coursework should be submitted via the Moodle course, and according to the deadlines set out therein.
