          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownBrown's Ph.D. program in the History of Art and Architecture offers professional training in the history of art and architecture and more broadly, the history of visual and material culture and the built environment. Our graduates have gone on to hold positions in museums and academic departments throughout the nation and abroad. The faculty publishes and directs dissertations that range widely in terms of time, place, media, and methodology. The Department has ties with Departments such as Modern Culture and Media, History, English, and Italian Studies and also with the Pembroke Center, the Cogut Center for the Humanities, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, East Asian Studies, Medieval Studies, Renaissance and Early Modern Studies, Urban Studies, the John Nicholas Brown Center, and the Rhode Island School of Design.The first two years of the doctoral program are devoted to course work, the fulfillment of the foreign language requirements, and the completion of a qualifying paper. Students should be ready to take their general examinations in their third year, and then proceed to the production of a dissertation prospectus. The remaining time in the program is given to researching and writing the dissertation, a project that is expected to involve original research and to demonstrate potential to become a book or series of articles.The following sections of the website are designed to give prospective students a sense of the program and its requirements, and to help students in the program to plan their path towards the Ph.D. We also include practical information to make your time at Brown as successful and rewarding as possible.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Qualifying Paper provides the faculty with one means of assessing whether or not the student can conceptualize new ideas, persuade by effective use of evidence and argument, and write fluently and clearly. The Qualifying Paper is both a requirement for the MA degree and a gateway exercise for acceptance into to the PhD program. After the requirements for the MA are completed and the Qualifying Paper accepted, the student must apply in writing for formal admission to the PhD program.The Qualifying Paper usually will be a revised seminar paper not to exceed 30 pages. Two readers usually drawn from the Department’s faculty must approve the paper (the main reader is often the departmental faculty member who oversaw the writing of the original paper). An MA thesis in art history from another institution can be used as a Qualifying Paper, but it must be vetted by 2 members of the Department’s faculty, and revised if it does not meet the necessary standard. You should be aware that in order to receive the MA in time for May Commencement, the Department must notify the Graduate School of your successful completion of MA requirements by May 1st. This means that your Qualifying Paper must be approved by both readers before that date. When submitting your Qualifying Paper for approval, leave plenty of time to make revisions in case they are requested. You are not required to submit copies of your Qualifying Paper to the Graduate School.The General Examination is designed to help students develop competency in their chosen field, broadly defined, as well as prepare them for focused research on their dissertation. There are two members of the examination committee: the student’s primary advisor, another member drawn from the Brown faculty. The committee will draw up three questions to be answered in writing. The student has two days to answer the questions, and may do so using appropriate research resources, although it is not expected that these questions will require further research beyond that done for General Examination preparation. The examination is intended to gauge the student’s depth of understanding of the problems, history, and methodologies of the field. It is expected that the general questions will take about three hours to answer thoughtfully and the other two questions no more than two hours each. No more than seven to ten days later the student and committee will convene to conduct an oral examination, lasting no more than an hour an a half. The oral examination is designed to extend the discussion of the written questions and focus on the issues raised in the student’s written responses.The student and his/her advisor should meet by the end of semester 4 to determine who, besides the advisor, will be a member of the examination committee. This person need not be a reader of the dissertation, although s/he may serve in that capacity as well. The student and primary advisor will meet together to define the field of examination. The primary advisor will prepare a field question and a question more narrowly focused on the student’s specific area of interest. The second member of the committee will prepare the other more specific question.The DGS will chair the oral examination based on the written essays generated by the General Exam questions. If the DGS is also the student’s advisor or second exam committee member, s/he will appoint another member of the faculty to chair the examination.Both the written and oral exercises will be assessed by the two faculty members constituting the examination committee. If the student fails all or part of the written or oral exam, s/he will have one opportunity to retake it. The retake must be successfully completed by the end of the next semester. Failure to pass the retake will result in termination from the graduate program. Passing the General Examination qualifies the student to move on to the next stage: preparing a Dissertation Prospectus and defending the prospectus in a Colloquium Examination.The Dissertation Prospectus should set out the major question or problem to be pursued in the dissertation. Length may vary, but it will normally run about 15 pages (double spaced), and should lay out the project in the context of the most relevant scholarship and bibliography, address why the project is important, what major sources will be used, and the critical methods to be used. (Students should note that there are successful examples of the Dissertation Prospectus kept in a binder in the graduate lounge, which may be useful in helping to conceptualize the writing of the Prospectus.) The prospectus should be circulated to the members of the student’s dissertation committee and discussed with individual committee members well before the meeting. The dissertation committee consists of at least three faculty members. Usually at least two members of the HAA Department are on the committee. The committee may also include a member who is outside of the HAA Department. This person must hold a tenure track or equivalent position at a four-year university or college; they are chosen in consultation between the student and advisor, and with the approval of the Department.The purpose of the Colloquium Examination is to discuss and assess the Dissertation Prospectus. It will be chaired by the DGS and attended by the student and the members of the dissertation committee (see preceding section for the constitution of this committee). If the DGS is a member of the dissertation committee, s/he will appoint another member of the faculty to chair the examination. The Colloquium Examination should last no more than one and a half hours. At the conclusion of this period, the committee will assess the student’s performance and notify the student whether s/he has passed the exam. If the student fails this examination s/he will have one opportunity to retake it. The retake must be successfully completed by the end of the next semester. Failure to pass the retake will result in termination from the graduate program. Advancement to PhD candidacy is achieved with the passage of the Colloquium Examination.The dissertation should be a substantial contribution to the scholarship in the history of art, embodying original research and suitable for publication as submitted or in revised form. While there is no formal defense exercise, the PhD candidate is expected to present his or her work at least once after the passing of the Colloquium at a Research Roundtable.While the work on the dissertation is under way, a written progress report by the student is required each semester. The report should be sent to the DGS, who will send it to the dissertation advisor.The Graduate School has a very specific set of rules regarding the format of the dissertation text and the procedures surrounding its submission. All of these regulations are available on the Graduate School website.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe ultimate goal of the PhD program, of course, is to complete it and to find employment. You should be in close touch with the DGS and your advisor in the year you expect to complete. The deadline for submission of the dissertation for May Commencement is in late January for semester I or early May for semester II (consult the Graduate School website for yearly specific dates). However, you should not wait until the deadline to alert your readers that the final version is coming. Allow time for last minute corrections.The Graduate School has strict regulations for the format and submission of the dissertation. All of these regulations are available on the Graduate School website. Note that you must supply the Department with a copy of your dissertation for its archives, in addition to those you supply to the Graduate School.Two months before the expected final submission for dissertation, a meeting with the dissertation committee may be scheduled in order to discuss the final version, and to make recommendations for future publication. It is useful to have in progress, if not in print, an article presenting the results of the dissertation for the scholarly community. This work can for the basis for a job talk.Employment opportunities in academia and the museum world are published in the CAA Job Bulletin published six times a year, in The Chronicle of Higher Education, and The Society for Architectural Historians Newsletter. (There are also online job listing services run by these organizations. See the “Resources” section of Department website for relevant links.) Job applicants must send a letter of interest, a current CV, and names of references. Short-listed applicants are often invited to an interview at the annual CAA conference, and if successful, to an on-campus interview. Mock interviews with Department faculty may be arranged.The Department has had a successful track record in placing graduates of its PhD program. Over the past seven years, students have secured tenure-track academic positions at Cornell University, Framingham State College, National Taiwan University, Rice University, Rutgers University, Rhode Island School of Design, University of Texas, Arlington, Trinity College, Tufts University, and Union College. Curatorial positions have been secured at The American Bible Society Gallery, The Cincinnati Art Museum, The National Gallery of Art, The Rhode Island School of Design Museum, The Art Institute of Chicago, and Wesleyan University. Students have also held postdoctoral fellowships at Columbia University and the National Gallery of Art.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownWe encourage all students to apply for outside aid. External awards provide you with extended research opportunities and professional contacts. They also comprise public recognition of the quality of your scholarly work, which is important to your career beyond Brown. There are numerous grants and fellowships available to individuals on the basis of field of specialization, project content, personal demographics, and various other criteria. The Department does its utmost to aid students in their application process. However, you must take the initiative in researching and seeking aid. A list of grants and fellowships to which our grad students have commonly made successful application is provided below. In most cases, information is available online; in a few cases you will receive information via email from Chantée Watts, or from announcements posted in the grad lounge. This is only a partial list. You will find other awards relevant to your work by using the many search tools listed on the “Resources” section of the Department’s website.Many major grants are competitive within a department, which means that we can only nominate one candidate. You will be asked to provide a short proposal requesting nomination if you wish to apply for one of these grants. Nominations are decided upon by the faculty in October; you will receive an email from Diana Adamczyk alerting you to the deadline for submission of proposals. The deadline is usually on or around October 15th.Other grants are open competitions and you can apply on your own. In each case, the Department and especially your advisor will give you as much assistance as possible in formulating your application. Be sure to ask for recommendation letters well in advance of deadlines, and supply your letter writers with all the information necessary for them to compose and submit a timely and positive letter of reference. Note, also, that although many grant deadlines are in late fall or even winter, the summer is an ideal time to start the process of identifying and preparing to apply for grants.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department mailing address is: Department of History of Art and Architecture, Box 1855, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912. Though not necessary for most correspondence, the physical street address of the List Art Center is62- 64 College Street. All mail sent to the Department goes first to the general graduate mailbox in the main office. It is delivered to graduate students’ mailboxes in the grad student lounge each afternoon.Graduate School funding checks are distributed twice monthly to Diana Adamczyk. You must pick your check up from Diana at the main office; they will not be delivered to your grad lounge mailbox. Alternatively, you may arrange for direct deposit at the Payroll Office in the Brown Office Building (BOB), located at 164 Angell Street. Paychecks for other campus jobs (such as working in the Art Slide Library), are also sent to the main office, but they are issued on a different pay schedule. Consult the payroll director at your other place of employment for details.Once you receive your Brown ID, you will automatically be entered into the Electronic Address Book (which is what you access when you search for a person’s contact information via Brown’s website). You can then self-register for an email account at any of the computing clusters, and establish a password. Your email address is normally composed of your name (First_Last@Brown.edu). The University does not maintain an off campus ISP, therefore to access the internet from home, you will need to subscribe to an internet service provider. Local options include Cox (digital cable) and Verizon (DSL). You must then download Brown’s VPN (Virtual Private Network) software in order to access Brown-restricted online services. Instructions and assistance are readily available from CIS (Brown’s IT department).Campus telephone directories are published yearly in the fall. The Department distributes them to offices with telephones and they are available upon request in the office. The Center for Information Technology (CIT) provides directories throughout the year at 115 Waterman Street.Diana Adamczyk will issue the 219 key to the graduate lounge, and the “MB” key (which opens the ASL, and List classrooms) to all graduate students.  A key to room 404,  the TA office,  will be issued with a TA assignment.Your Brown ID card can be obtained (and replaced) at the Brown Card Office in Emery Dorm at any time (including during the summer, if you need to obtain library access before the semester begins). Your ID card gives you access to campus libraries and academic buildings; it is also your library card, your Banner registration ID card, and your declining balance print and copy card. Your card can be enabled to grant you after hours access to List. Contact Diana Adamczyk in the HAA office if you would like your card to be enabled. Effective September 1, 2007 current faculty, staff, and students are able to ride any RIPTA bus or trolley anytime, anywhere in the state at no charge. The UPASS program DOES NOT include the Providence-Newport Ferry.Each student is entitled to one PAWprints card per academic year. The card contains a significant cash credit that can be used in library printers (though not copy machines). You must pick up your card at the CIT. You need your Brown ID in order to get a PAWprints card.The Brown Bookstore is located on Thayer Street, across Angell Street from Paragon Restaurant (a campus standby). Textbooks and regalia are located on the second floor; the campus computer store in located in the basement.Parking on streets near List is metered during weekday business hours. Free on-street parking on campus is possible, but one must usually look several blocks from List in order to find it. There are several parking lots maintained by Brown, which you must purchase a pass to use. Alternatively, Brown offers free transportation to all Brown ID holders on any bus or trolley operated by RIPTA, Rhode Island’s public bus system, via the UPASS program. Zipcar operates a short-term car rental cooperative in Providence with three vehicles located on the Brown campus. There is also a campus shuttle service. Many graduate students choose to live within walking or biking distance, though this is by no means a necessity. Consult the Transportation Office for further information 401-863-3157.Housing is a matter of personal preference, however you should be aware that there are several resources you may find helpful in making your living arrangements. The Brown graduate community listserv, GSBB-L, is often used to exchange information about available or desired housing. (Subscription works on the same model as described above.) The Graduate School itself offers limited on-campus housing for grad students (See Graduate School website). You may also wish to consult with the University Auxiliary Housing office, which maintains a housing bulletin board on campus as well as online. The Brown Book (a guide to life in Providence available online from the Graduate Student Council’s website) may help you evaluate your options in terms of price range, location, and other considerations. Craigslist.com may also be a helpful resource.There are a number of restaurants within easy walking distance of List on Benefit Street and Thayer Street. Campus Dining offers lunches in several locations, including the Blue Room Café in the student center (Faunce House) on the main green, as well as in the basement of the main refectory (affectionately called the “Ratty” on George Street, across from St. Stevens Church). The Rock and the Sciences Library have snack cafés in their lobbies. In addition, you can use the facilities at the Rhode Island School of Design cafeteria, which are literally across Waterman Street from the List Art Building. They offer lunch from 11-2 and dinner from 6-8 at reasonable prices and with an extensive selection. The Brown Book contains many local restaurant reviews and suggestions, as well as a wealth of other information about living in the Providence area.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownApplicants to the Graduate Program must possess the Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent and submit GRE (Aptitude) results. Application is made directly to the Graduate School. The Department requires a writing sample to be submitted with your application. We also strongly recommend that applicants set up an on-campus or telephone interview with faculty members in your field(s) of interest.While time-to-completion of the PhD degree varies, the Graduate School does not automatically provide funding beyond the five year guarantee. Therefore, students ideally spend the first and second years taking courses, a third year preparing for and taking General Exams and Colloquium Exam, a year of dissertation research and a year to write the dissertation and apply for jobs. Dissertation work that extends beyond the fifth year is funded by awards from the Graduate School (obtained by application through the Department) and by external grants and fellowships. The following requirements apply to all graduate students in the Department. You should confer with the DGS and with your advisor about crafting your individual course of study.Students admitted to the graduate program must first complete the requirements for the MA degree. We do not admit students to do a terminal MA; however, the MA/equivalent must be obtained in order to advance to the PhD phase of program. A minimum of 10 course credits is required for the MA. This includes no fewer than 6 departmental seminars, among them two 2000-level seminars. In addition to the two 2000-level seminars, all students must take HIAA 2920 (Methods) and HIAA 2930 (Practicum) during the first two years. HIAA 2920 and HIAA 2930 are offered in alternating years (so you will take one course in your first year, and the remaining course in your second year). Although graduate credit for language courses will be given (undergraduate courses need special graduate credit), those courses cannot be part of the required 10 course core requirement. In individual cases and after consultation with the student’s advisor or the DGS, a departmental seminar can be replaced with a seminar outside of the Department, or with HIAA 2980 or 2981 (individual reading courses conducted in consultation with a faculty member). Up to four undergraduate lecture courses or seminars within and outside of the department can be taken for graduate credit, if the DGS and the instructor of that particular course agree.Students entering the program with an MA in art/architectural history may receive up to 8 credits (the equivalent of one year towards the PhD residency requirement) for art/architectural history courses taken in their previous graduate program. During the first two years of residence, they must fulfill all language requirements and must complete the sequence HIAA 2920, HIAA 2930. Students will not, under normal circumstances, receive a second MA degree in art history from Brown.Before they apply to be formally admitted to the PhD program, students must complete coursework in at least three periods or areas of the history of art and architecture. These areas are: Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern (ca. 1400-1800), Modern, East Asian, or other areas of non-Western art. Students must take one course in an area distant in time or place from the area in which they intend to specialize. Practicum and Methods courses may be counted towards the distribution requirements. Students entering with the MA may request that courses taken at the granting institution may be counted towards distribution requirement.All students are required to have a reading knowledge of at least two foreign languages in order to receive their MA/equivalent. For Ancient, European and American art and architecture, the typical language requirement is a reading knowledge of German and French. For Asian art and architecture, the minimum requirement is one European language and Chinese. Exceptions can be granted by the faculty in special cases, where, for example, a reading knowledge of Spanish and Dutch would best complement a student’s research interest. The exams can be held any time and are arranged by appointment with Prof. Bonde, Prof. Zerner or Prof. Vanel (French) and Prof. Neumann (German). As only your reading knowledge is tested, you are usually asked to translate a part of a mid-level text with the help of your dictionary. You will be given one hour. Both speed and quality of the translation will be judged. Unsuccessful exams are graded, and suggestions made for improvement. All students must take examinations to verify non-native language competency. This applies to students coming to the Department with MAs from other programs, who may have passed language exams as part of their MA. There is no limit to the number of times that students may retake the exams.Students will typically submit a revised and expanded seminar paper to a departmental committee for approval as an MA/equivalent Qualifying Paper. The Qualifying Paper is both a requirement for the MA/equivalent and a gateway exercise for formal acceptance to the PhD program. Students who have already written an MA thesis in art or architectural history may submit this for approval. It may be accepted, accepted with revisions, or rejected. (See subsequent section of handbook for further description.)All first year graduate students must attend the Research Roundtable (no course credit); all others are strongly encouraged to attend.Students must take all academic credit courses “ABC/No Credit” unless it is impossible to do so. At the end of each semester, each student will receive written evaluations of his/her performance from all instructors in the department. These evaluations will take into account the participation in each seminar, performance as a proctor or TA, and/or progress towards the dissertation. Evaluations are given in order to provide fuller feedback than a simple grade can provide. Students are urged to discuss evaluations with faculty members, and to identify areas for improvement. We also urge students to be in close contact with their advisors, with the DGS, with their instructors and with the professor in whose course they serve as TA.Students are not permitted to hold more than one grade of “Incomplete” at any given time. Be aware that an Incomplete makes it difficult for the faculty to evaluate and rank you. Students should make every effort to complete work on time, and to discuss their progress with faculty. A pattern of Incompletes will be considered in evaluation of student standing and rankings.Students holding TAships or proctorships may register for only three courses per semester under University regulations. You are still considered a full-time student in this case.The doctoral program prepares students for specialized research in one of the fields regularly taught on the graduate level by the Department. After completing requirements for the MA, students must apply in writing for formal admission to the PhD program. Students must then satisfactorily complete the General Examination and Colloquium Examination (both described below) in order to progress to the status of PhD candidacy and the dissertation writing stage. The program does not have a formal dissertation defense exercise, however PhD candidates are expected to present their work to the Department at a Research Roundtable.The normal residency requirement is the equivalent of three years of full-time study beyond the bachelor’s degree; at least two semesters beyond the MA must be spent exclusively in full-time study at Brown. Graduate work done at other institutions and not used in fulfillment of the requirements for the PhD degree elsewhere may, on the recommendation of the Department, and with the approval of the Registrar, be counted in fulfillment of the degree requirement. However, no more than the equivalent of one full year of study may be counted in this manner. A student who desires credit for work done elsewhere should file an application after completing at least on semester at Brown. Forms are available from the Office of the Registrar.The schedule of courses beyond the MA is up to the discretion of the student and his/her advisor. Typically, students who are in the process of preparing for their General Exam and Colloquium, or doing research for their dissertation, will sign up for individual reading/research units for single, double, or triple credit. When you have completed your academic credit and tuition unit requirements, there are also course codes which allow you to maintain your status as an active student but which do not bear academic credit or tuition fees. (Please see Appendix D for a summary of course codes for advanced students.)Brown counts "tuition units" as well as academic credits: a full year's tuition equals 8 tuition units. It is important to note that tuition units are not the same as academic units. As a PhD student, you are required to enroll in and complete 13 courses for academic credit, but you must pay for 24 tuition units whether you take further formal courses or individual reading/research credits. As soon as you have completed 24 tuition units, you will register using non-credit-bearing course codes and pay only an enrollment fee, a health insurance fee, and a health services fee. If you are within your period of guaranteed funding, all of these fees should fall within your funding package. You must continue to pay these fees after you have fulfilled your 24 tuition credits if you are no longer taking academic courses but still want to be considered as working toward your PhD. Please see the Graduate School website for tuition requirement details.Traveling Scholars are active students who engage in full-time research away from Brown. There is a fee for this status (equal to the cost of enrollment), but you do not have to pay health services or activities fees, and you may apply for a health insurance waiver or subsidy. Brown facilities are not available to traveling scholars. Further information and forms are available on the Graduate School website.Leaves of Absence are granted for a variety of professional, educational, medical, psychological and personal reasons. They are granted for one semester or for one year, and may be extended to two years if necessary. On leave of absence, no student may take examinations, use any of the facilities of the University (including the services of a dissertation or thesis advisor), submit a thesis or dissertation, or be a candidate for an advanced degree unless properly enrolled. Students who re-enroll after an approved leave of absence may be charged a readmission fee in addition to the appropriate tuition or enrollment fee. Library borrowing privileges can be purchased (inquire at the Rockefeller Library Circulation desk). If you are an alumnus, such as a Master’s degree holder, you may use the library under that status. Further information and forms are available on the Graduate School website.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department determines the form in which your guaranteed Graduate School funding is allocated to you. TAships, Proctorships, Research Assistantships, and Research Fellowships will be assigned according to the faculty’s assessment of the graduate student’s needs as well as the needs of the undergraduate program. These positions come with tuition, health insurance, health services fee, and a stipend.Brown’s PhD program trains graduate students to become teachers as well as researchers. We regard TAships not only as financial aid, but as an opportunity for you to develop your teaching skills. Most students will hold TAships in the Department from the second to the fourth year. Each TA works closely with the professor from the assigned course to design independent discussion sections for undergraduate students enrolled in the class. You will be asked to teach two sections of approximately 15-25 students each, and to grade assignments for those students.Proctorships are research internships, normally at the RISD Museum. There may also be opportunities to serve as a Research Assistant for a professor in the HAA Department or beyond.The Department is committed to a policy that will allow us to staff large classes appropriately, while allowing graduate students the opportunity to teach in smaller classes, especially those in their chosen area of interest. To this end the Department keeps records of enrollments by course, a history of which courses graduate students have TA’d for, and a history of when and which small classes (under 50 students) have had TAs. Our goal is to staff the large classes to a ratio of 1 TA per 50 undergraduates and to assign, on a rotating basis, a single TA to classes between 35 and 50 students. Classes under 35 students will not receive a TA unless enrollments are such that we have people and positions to spare. We will try to ensure that graduate students will have the opportunity to TA for a variety of classes, including small (35-50) classes and, at least once during their time at Brown, a class taught by their advisor. Graduate students should understand, however, that the opportunity to TA for their advisor will depend on enrollments and the leave pattern of the faculty.In making TA assignments fairly and equitably, the DGS will take into account the requests of the graduate students and the history of their previous TA or proctor assignments. Large fluctuations in course enrollments caused by Brown’s two week “shopping period” make it impossible to assign all the TAships in advance of the beginning of the semester. Before the semester begins, however, the DGS will assign a core group of TAs to courses that have regularly drawn more than 50 students. The individuals forming this core group will be drawn from the ranks of those less advanced graduate students who are still engaged in coursework, since they have the most difficult schedules to manage. The DGS will also, where at all possible, try to indicate which of one or two possible courses those not in the core group (“floaters”) will be most likely be assigned to, so they can arrange their own schedule accordingly. It is anticipated that most sections will begin the second full week of classes, but there is no way fairly to regulate when sections will begin. Some enrollments stabilize earlier than others, and undergraduates in these courses should not be forced to forego sections because other class enrollments are still fluctuating. Faculty members decide whether or not to teach classes or hold review sessions during reading week. While some TAs may teach an extra section or two in a given semester, varying the types of TA assignments students have over their Brown career should ensure that no one will repeatedly have to teach more than the norm. If such a disparity does arise, the graduate student should contact the DGS immediately, so that the situation can be redressed in future TA assignments.TAs are responsible for grading the examinations and papers of no more than 50 undergraduates. Faculty members are expected to help with the grading if necessary. In the case of serious shortfalls the faculty member may seek assistance from the Department in hiring additional graders.TAs are responsible for teaching no more than 25* students per section. They also are expected to hold weekly office hours and to meet with students by appointment who are unable to attend scheduled office hours. (*Based on the number of students who actually attend section after the first 2 weeks that sections are held.)The faculty will supply the TAs with a written statement of their duties and responsibilities at the beginning of each semester. TAs should bear in mind, however, that circumstances may arise where the faculty may need to call on the TA to do the occasional task that was not anticipated, therefore not set out in writing in advance. Regular duties will vary from course to course. Commonly assigned duties, beyond grading, preparing (with the help of the faculty member) and teaching sections include: posting images to course website, photocopying hand-outs, assignments and examinations, and accompanying the faculty member on field trips. Some faculty may also request that their TAs pull slides, make slide sheets, or post information to a course website. This is acceptable as long as the TA is not averaging more than the 20 hours a week mandated as the maximum time to be spent on TA related work.Preparing sections: In courses staffed by 2 or more TAs, section preparation will be done on a rotating basis. All the TAs will use the same section preparation as the starting point for teaching their section. The faculty member in charge is expected to help the TAs with these preparations.The Sheridan Center provides pedagogical training and teaching certification, as well as other professional development services, to faculty and graduate students. More information about programs and services can be found at the Sheridan Center website.The department has a standard evaluation form for each class, in which students are asked to evaluate the course and its design, and the performance of the professor and TA. These forms provide us with valuable information on each course. It is the professor’s responsibility to provide students with ample time to fill out the evaluations at some point during class at the end of the semester. You should let students know that you value their responses, and that you will not be allowed to read them until after grades have been submitted. TAs are allowed to review evaluations in the department office after the end of the semester in which the course was taught. The feedback provided on evaluations can be useful in helping you develop your skills as a teacher. In addition, quality of your performance as a TA (effort, participation, etc) reflects on graduate student rankings and evaluation by professors. So that the professor’s impression of your teaching skills is not based solely on undergraduate evaluations, you should invite a member of the faculty to visit one of your sections. Such a visit can provide useful insights on your teaching strategies, and, importantly, will allow that faculty member to write an informed letter regarding your teaching when you venture onto the job market.The Graduate School's policy is that Teaching Assistants spend no more than 15-20 hours a week on teaching.Students having trouble should not hesitate to consult the DGS, the Department Chair, or the relevant faculty member. Most problems can be averted in advance through timely communication. In the unlikely event of a problem that cannot be resolved within the Department, the Graduate School has adopted a university-wide grievance procedure, to which you may turn if these less formal and local measures fail. In cases where there is some disagreement between you and the faculty member or between either and the DGS, the Chair will review the evidence, discuss the matter with everyone involved, and report his or her conclusions in writing to you. If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of this process, you are always free to pursue the Graduate School's grievance procedures. You can easily obtain a copy of this document in the Department office or from the office of the Dean of the Graduate School.If one of your students has complaints about your teaching or grading and you cannot resolve the problem yourself, you should discuss the situation to the faculty member supervising the course.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownPhoto credits: Daniel StoneThe Department of the History of Art offers students two separate concentrations. Students can choose to concentrate in the History of Art and Architecture or in Architectural Studies. The two concentrations are allied, but they also have different goals and requirements. What they share is stated here. You can find the different requirements and goals for each by clicking on the links for the two concentrations.Whether you choose to concentrate in the History of Art and Architecture or in Architectural Studies, the Department's goal is to provide you with a strong theoretical and historical understanding of the visual and material environment created by humankind. You will encounter a vast range of works, from the most recognized buildings, paintings, and sculptures to deeper layers of material culture. In courses that span history you will explore the past as a foreign country with all its surprises and different from what you might expect. And you will range across the globe in courses that embrace human creation throughout the world.Both concentrations aim to engage you with the history of art and architecture as a humanistic discipline. You will master the different analytical tools that have been developed and are currently used in practice to expand our knowledge of art and material culture in history. These include a wide spectrum of approaches, from gender theory and the structural analysis of buildings to direct familiarity with the classification by date and style of artworks and material culture or the relationship between production of paintings and the history of economics.  In your courses, you will discover the history of art and architecture as a lively field of inquiry, embracing theoretical questions that open up new areas and issues. Your path into understanding new cultures and historical periods also will be opened by learning to read at least one foreign language as part of what both concentrations require.Both concentrations will prepare you to choose from a variety of professional goals. Our graduates have built careers in higher education, museum work, the art market, architectural history and practice, historic preservation, publishing, cultural property law, and other fields.Students who wish to concentrate in the History of Art and Architecture or Architectural Studies are welcome to do so after consultation with the Departmental Undergraduate Supervisor, Professor Jeffrey Muller (jeffrey_muller@brown.edu, office hours:     Fall 2017 semester Tue 2:30-4:30p . Thur 11:00a-12:00p List Art Building 411)Students who wish to concentrate in the Brown/RISD Architecture concentration are welcome to do so after consultation with one of the Architecture Undergraduate Supervisors, Professor Dietrich Neumann(Dietrich_Neumann@brown.edu, office hours: Wed 2:30-3:30 List ARt Building 412), Professor Itohan Osayimwese (Itohan_Osayimwese@brown.edu, office hours:  Tue 1:00-2:20p List Art Building 414), or Professor Sheila Bonde, (Sheila_Bonde@Brown.edu, office hours: Tue 1:30-3:00p List Art Building 413).The Concentration Supervisor should be consulted for matters concerning course selection, approval to take RISD courses, approval to study abroad, and the final approval of transfer credits for courses taken outside of Brown.Brown students may take as many as 4 courses at the Rhode Island School of Design (History of Art and Architecture concentrators can count only 2 of these for concentration credit). Only two circumstances will require a student to petition in advance of registration: when students wish to study at RISD for 5 or more courses and when students intend to enroll in a RISD course that satisfies RISD's Liberal Arts degree requirements. The Committee on Academic Standing (CAS) demands that students who desire to have more than 4 RISD courses counted toward their Brown degree present an academic rationale in each instance. In the event of Brown/RISD curricular overlap, students are asked to enroll in the Brown course.  Please see link to Brown registrar guidelines:https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/course-enrollment/registration#risdInformation on approved programs for study abroad may be obtained at the Office of International Programs in J. Walter Wilson Buidling,  Suite 510.  Forms necessary for preliminary and final approval are also available there for the concentration advisor's signature. Transfer credits will be counted as lecture courses rather than seminars. Concentrators may receive concentration credit for two courses taken abroad. Summer courses require advance approval from the concentration advisor, and should be at least five weeks long, excluding the final examination, in order to count for Brown credit.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe concept for this new concentration has evolved in response to continuous interest among our students, and in discussions with the architecture department at the Rhode Island School of Design.The concentration has been designed in order for students to develop a broad understanding of the concepts and methods for the planning and design of buildings, landscapes, and cities. In significant contrasts with other architecture undergraduate majors, it has also been planned with the explicit goal of connecting architectural training firmly with the humanities and providing a greater awareness of global, environmental, social and economic issues in the built environment.  This approach to the education of architects and urban planners is meant to provide them with the tools needed in today’s urban global society. It will also bring together two strengths of Brown and RISD.By combining a carefully selected range of classes in the fields of the architectural design, the humanities, technology, urban life and theory, Brown students will acquire an increased proficiency for pursuing a graduate degree in architecture. The new concentration at Brown will require a sequence of at least 14 classes (or 42 credits - the time intensive studio classes will be double credit). The students will take at least two double credit studio design classes (offered either at Brown or at RISD), and at least 18 credits of architectural technology, architectural history, construction or architectural drawing, plus at least 6 credits of liberal arts classes on subjects such as urban literature, theatre set design, social sciences, modern culture and media etc. (see sample classes below)Students in this concentration will probably find the design studios the most unusual part of their experience at Brown. They require (much) more time than seminars or lecture courses and they take place in a workshop atmosphere, in which independent motivation and focus are as crucial as the willingness to collaborate and learn from each other. In these studios individual designs of buildings and urban areas are prepared by students and then analyzed and critiqued by the faculty and, usually twice a semester, by invited guests.The planning of the concentration has profited greatly from closely examining similar courses of study at peer institutions, such as Princeton, Harvard and Yale, and from the advice of deans at additional institutions, before, during and after a major symposium jointly organized by Brown and RISD on April 24/25 2015, called “Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities.” Among the speakers were Amale Andros (Columbia), Nader Tehrani (MIT), Stan Allan (Princeton), Kent Kleinman (Cornell), Nicholas Boyarski (AA London), Matthias Sauerbruch (Akademie der Künste, Berlin), Martha Thorne (IE Madrid), Bernard Tschumi (Columbia). It became clear that the concept of this new concentration at Brown has the chance of playing a unique role among comparable programs, due to the collaboration of two distinct institutions with their own cultures, and a stronger than usual emphasis on a broad interdisciplinary  integration of design with the humanities, engineering and the social sciences. Our program will grow in close collaborations and exchange with above listed colleagues, who promised to remain engaged in its evolution.The selection of courses and style of the studios will emphasize as much as possible a ‘learning from precedent’ and a stronger focus on solutions for real world problems, rather than on abstract formal exercises. While abstraction always forms an important element in any architectural training, we hope students will also learn to see and observe in a profound way, read, measure, analyze their environment, develop opinions about what works and what doesn't, find out how light flows and changes, how it can be manipulated, how spatial sequences function, etc. While training in digital representation has to be part of any architectural education today, we also want to emphasize the value of learning to sketch and draw, the craft of making models by hand rather than ‘3D-print’ them. We hope to strengthen ties with the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies in order to give room to the notion of narrative in architecture, a notoriously underdeveloped subject in architectural education. How do spaces generate action, facilitate or prevent certain functions?Students in the concentration have the option to qualify for ‘advanced standing.’ They will be able to transition into a 2 year program at RISD or several other architecture schools, concluded by an MArch degree from that institution. The above described course selection follows the suggestions of the National Colleges of Architecture Accreditation Board (NAAB), but, of course, each case will have to be approved by RISD or any other institution that accepts students with a certificate of ‘advanced standing.’The scope of courses for advanced standing is as follows (according to RISD’s requirement for the acceptance to the Advanced Standing track): “Applicants must have completed a four-year undergraduate degree with a major in architecture, at an accredited College or University. These applicants should have completed at least 2 semesters of 6 credit studios in Architecture and, in the view of the admission committee, demonstrate a high degree of design proficiency, the equivalent to two semesters of graduate level studio work. In addition applicants must have completed 24 credits (or equivalent) of architecture courses including 18 credits of architectural technology, architectural history, construction or architectural drawing. Another 6 credits of undergraduate coursework would be credited for a total of 42 credits. A minimum grade of B is required for any course to count towards advanced standing. The acceptance to the advanced standing track is at the sole discretion of the admission committee. Successful advanced standing track applicants typically complete their degree requirements in 2 years.” All students, however, will end up with much more and better material for their portfolios (a collection of work samples) which they submit when applying to architecture schools.We hope that many students will make use of study abroad options, although the option is not required.   Students who elect to pursue the study abroad option will most likely do so in the second semester of their junior year. We have already discussed arrangements specific to the new concentration with the AEDES campus in Berlin in collaboration with Bard College, with our partner university in Madrid, “IE” and the architecture school at their Segovia campus, which is particularly well suited for this particular purpose, and RISD’s Rome program. These programs would offer one studio and one architectural history course, as well as language instructions.From the 2016/17 AY onwards Brown will – in all likelihood - offer 5 week condensed winter sessions from late December through January. These new course times and formats will be advantageous for our collaboration. Studio courses could be taken during winter session in Berlin at AEDES for example. Discussions are also under way with a non-profit organization in Guatemala in order to provide a sustainable design/build workshop in San Antonio/Panajachel during winter session.This new concentration would be declared at the end of the Sophomore year, but courses counting towards it could already taken earlier. In particular, the Introduction to Architectural Design that is offered every spring is considered a prerequisite and a ‘testing ground’ for interested students and should ideally be taken before declaring the concentration.As there is a certain amount of overlap between the new ‘architecture’ concentration (14 courses) and the existing ‘architectural studies’ concentration (10 courses), students will be able to switch to ‘architectural studies’ during either junior or senior year if they realize that the 14 required classes are not feasible for them.We currently have 25 students on a waitlist for “Introduction to Architectural Design” in the spring. From these, we expect ca. 5 students to apply for the new concentration. This number could grow to 12 in the coming years, which is a good studio size, given the amount of time spent on individual and group critiques. Our colleagues at RISD have agreed to accommodate our students in their current design courses.For students in the concentration who intend to go to architecture school afterwards, typically their design project in their double credit second studio will be ideal for a capstone or honors project. For others, who might tend towards theory or history of architecture, an honors thesis is still a valid option.No experience is as useful for a potential future architect than the exposure to the realities of work in an architectural office. Our department has a long history of placing our students in local, and East Coast design firms as interns (LLB Architects, Friedrich St. Florian, Bjarke Ingels, Richter Tightman, Robert Venturi etc.) We continue to expand our list of contacts and urge students to take on internships while enrolled in our program. An independent study in conjunction with an internship is a good possibility.In order to ensure that students in this program acquire good writing skills, we have designated several of the courses in the history of architecture (which already have a substantial writing requirement) as WRIT courses. There are a number of electives (Urban literature, for example) that also have a WRIT designation.As a very interdisciplinary concentration the new architecture major will require new models of collaboration both within Brown (History of Art and Architecture, Urban Studies, Theatre and Performing Arts, Engineering etc.) and with the Rhode Island School of Design (Architecture, Interior Architecture). It will also seek collaboration with other recent initiatives at Brown in the area of art, design and urban improvements, such as the Creative Arts Council, the Brown Design Workshop (BDW) at the School of Engineering, Brown TRI-LAB, which brings together “students, faculty and community practitioners to engage with a complex social issue and collaboratively develop, refine and test solutions to the issue,” and Brown Design for America at the John Street Studio, operated through the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies Department.At RISD we have worked very closely with the department of architecture (Laura Briggs and Hansy Better) and we hope to include classes at RISD’s IntAR department as well. While Brown is planning to include winter sessions in its curriculum, the calendar of both schools will still not be entirely aligned in the foreseeable future. This will mean that students in our program taking classes at RISD might meet with their instructors once or twice before the RISD semester begins and continue to take classes for another week or two after Brown’s semester ends.We hope to continue our longstanding collaboration with the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and use 50 John Street as a studio space for the introductory classes. Classes at RISD will accommodate students at the BEB and IntAR studio spaces. Over the past year, a number of new ‘maker spaces’ have evolved at Brown, and we hope to become one of the foci of this network, as our students will create models (both analytical models of historical or contemporary architecture and their own designs), pieces of furniture, furnishings, objects at studios all over campus, such as in Prince Lab, Tockwotton, 50 John Street, the future lab at the Rockefeller Library etc.The new concentration relies upon existing faculty and resources at both institutions. The single exception is the Introductory design studio course at Brown, taught for many years by Prof. Neumann.For the past several years, we have hired adjunct faculty with expertise in architecture and design to teach the course and will continue to do so, depending upon availability of funding.We will always have a team of dedicated advisors for this program at both schools. At RISD it will be Profs Laura Briggs, Hansy Better and Jonathan Knowles (or the current chair of the architecture school and director of graduate studies, plus one studio teacher). At Brown, we will share the advising among the three professors predominantly involved with architecture: Sheila Bonde, Itohan Osayimwese, Dietrich Neumann. We will provide regularly updated information about the advising structure on a dedicated website for the concentration and on Focal Point. Our current ‘standing committee’ of two Brown and two RISD faculty will continue to discuss and resolve any issues that arise as the program evolves.We highly recommend that students first take the “Introduction to Architectural Design Studio” during spring of their sophomore year, in order to try their inclination towards and talent for architectural design. Depending on enrollment figures we might introduce a selection process for the concentration based on a portfolio of previous work. Below is a list with sample courses for the Brown undergraduate architecture major, to be taken during a student’s four years at Brown, most of them after declaring the concentration at the end of their Sophomore year. These requirements are meant to fulfill entrance requirements for “advanced standing” in several architecture schools such as RISD’s. At Brown the program will bring together the Engineering School, Urban Studies, History of Art and Architecture and other social sciences and humanities departments. In case a student is given the certificate of “advanced standing,” design studios and other classes follow at RISD in year 5  and 6, if not, in year 5, 6 and 7.BROWN HIAA 0100 Intro Design Studio (Carpenter) (3 credits)Many architecture schools require one each of introductory level math and physics classes.  For example:MATH 0090, 0100 or 0170 or 0190PHYS 0030Two double credit Design Studios- RISD/BROWN ARCH 2102 Architectural Design Studio (6 credits)- RISD/BROWN ARCH 2103 Advanced Design Studio (6 credits)Six Core requirements (“at least 18 credits of architectural technology, architectural history, construction or architectural drawing”).

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Architectural Studies concentration within the Department of History of Art and Architecture blends a variety of disciplines toward the study of buildings and the built environment. The concentration prepares students for the continued study of architecture and the history of architecture in graduate school as well as careers in related areas such as urban studies. The concentration requires four lecture courses and two seminars in the history of architecture and urbanism that are offered by the Department of History of Art and Architecture. One of the seminars is a project seminar, taken in junior or senior year, and is designed as a capstone experience for the Architectural Studies concentrator. All concentrators in Architectural Studies must take a project seminar. Courses that may be counted toward the concentration are listed with an "A" at the end of their descriptions in BANNER and in the Course Announcement Bulletin.Because the architectural studies program was especially designed for students wishing to gain greater experience in the practical skills necessary for a career in architecture or a related field, concentrators are required to take a course in design from the Visual Arts Department, the Rhode Island School of Design or an introduction to architectural design, theatre set design at Brown University.Students will be able and are encouraged to take cross-listed pertinent courses from such departments or programs as American Civilization, Center for Old World Archaeology and Art, Engineering, Mathematics, History, Modern Culture and Media, Urban Studies, and Visual Art, in addition to those offered by the Department. They can receive concentration credit for a maximum of two of these courses. Study abroad can be a valuable enrichment of the academic work available on campus, in that it offers opportunities for first-hand knowledge of architecture and the built environment as well as providing exposure to foreign languages and cultures. Study abroad should be planned in consultation with the concentration advisor in order to make sure that foreign course work will relate meaningfully to the concentrator's program of study. Only two courses taken outside the department may count for concentration credit (including courses taken abroad and at other institutions in the United States). These credits will be counted as lecture courses, not seminars.The equivalent of two and a half years of foreign language study are required for concentrators, in order to read scholarship in at least one other language and to sensibly interact with an architectural culture other than your own. Students with previous language experience will be asked to take a placement test and demonstrate a reading ability equivalent to passing a 500 level Brown University language course. You can also fulfill the language requirement by passing a 500 level Brown University language course (students who declared before August 2013 must demonstrate proficiency through the 400 level).DECLARATIONBrown Students usually choose and declare their concentrations towards the end of the fourth semester of the Sophomore year.  After you decide to concentrate inHistory of Art or Architectural Studies the first step is to declare your concentration.  To do that you need to go to:  https://ask.brown.edu/home/.  During this process you should talk with the Concentration Advisor to set up your plans. Please note:  courses that fulfill concentration requirements must be taken for a letter grade.As noted above, you can receive a maximum 2 concentration credits for courses taken outside the Department in other Brown departments or at other universities (transfer credits or from study abroad programs), or for courses that also count towards a second concentration. No concentration credit is given for High School AP, Subsidiary AP, A level etc. courses. No concentration credit is given for language classes.It is expected that concentrators will wish to focus on a particular period (e.g. ancient, modern architecture), a particular branch of the field (e.g. urbanism), or a methodology (e.g. semiotics, critical interpretation, archaeology). Students are encouraged to formulate their own coherent program of study.A recent placement test for a 500 level reading capacity, or passing of a 400 level language class. All concentrators are required to write an essay when they file for the concentration that lays out what they expect to gain from the course of study they propose.  All second semester seniors will be required to write a final essay that takes measure of what they have learned from the concentration, including their capstone and other experiences relating to their study of the history of art and architecture. For students doing a capstone, their capstone director will read this essay. A department subcommittee will read essays written by students not electing to do a capstone.  The self-assessment should be turned in with a revised list of courses actually taken and the final paperwork for concentration approval.Attendance at lecture events and conferences in the HIAA department is strongly encouraged.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownA five-year combined BA/MA program is offered to Brown undergraduate concentrators who know by their junior year that they wish to pursue such an option, and have enough credits in the concentration to also be able to complete the MA requirements in their senior year plus one more year.  To arrange such a schedule, the student should meet with the Undergraduate Supervisor as early as possible in the junior year to go over the requirements and to make sure that enough classes have been taken in the proper areas to satisfy concentration requirements.  There is not at this time financial aid available for the fifth year of study.  Along with the 10 courses required to satisfy the undergraduate concentration, combined BA/MA students will also be required to meet the graduate requirements for the MA degree, which include passing an exam in French and GermanRequirements for the graduate portion of the combined BA/MA degree:• The graduate Methods and Practicum courses, offered in sequential Fall semesters This will mean that the student will take either Methods HIAA 2920 or Practicum, HIAA 2930, whichever is then being  offered, in Fall of the senior year.•Eight other courses in addition to the above, of which 6 must be 2000-level graduate seminars or individual reading courses at the graduate level.  Combined graduate/undergraduate courses, or undergraduate courses appropriate to the student’s stated course of study, and modified to include graduate level exercises such as an extensive written paper or other mutually agreed upon project, may be counted towards this number in consultation with the student’s sponsoring advisor and the DGS.•A thesis or thesis project arrived at in consultation with the student’s advisor.  To prepare such a project, typically in their final semester at Brown, the student may register for HIAA 2940, Master’s Qualifying Preparation, using their advisor’s section number.  The final paper or project may be a perfected version of a seminar paper or project, and must be accepted by the student’s advisor and one other reader, from within or outside the department, to be arrived at in consultation between the student and the advisor.  It should then be filed with the Graduate School according to their rules for filing an MA thesis, available on their website.Students will receive the BA at graduation in their senior year, and the MA at graduation the following year.  In their senior year, they will most probably be taking a combination of undergraduate and graduate courses.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe concentration in the History of Art and Architecture encourages you to explore a broad variety of courses about art and architecture that range across the globe and through history. You also will gain the opportunity to pursue in-depth studies of a particular area or issue through seminar courses. These limited enrollment, more advanced courses will deepen your understanding of the critical strategies available for interpretation of historical and cultural phenomena, and they will sharpen your research and writing skills.To complete the concentration, you will be expected to take a minimum of ten courses (11 for honors). Our goal in setting out these requirements is to welcome students into a lively and diverse Department that also shares a cohesive and strong commitment to the field. We as a faculty want students to cultivate their special interests and also to venture into areas that may not be so familiar but that will open new and exciting possibilities for them. Ten courses are only the minimum requirement. Beyond that students are encouraged to take courses at RISD, participate in study abroad programs, and take courses in other Brown departments. Because we are a truly interdisciplinary Department, you will also find that our faculty collaborates with members of other departments to teach courses that bring together the strengths of different disciplines. We encourage both experimentation and concentration.Our general survey in history of art and architecture (HIAA0010) is an excellent foundation for the concentration. It is not a prerequisite for taking other lecture courses but you can count it as one of the 4 non-core courses required for the concentration (see below for core and non-core courses).You will be expected to demonstrate reading proficiency in a language other than English. By learning the language of another culture you will gain a deeper understanding of its art, literature and history. Aside from this, knowledge of a foreign language will equip you with a skill essential skill for pursuing art historical studies in a professional environment or graduate school. The requirement can be fulfilled by either passing a 500 level language course at Brown or by demonstrating a 500 level reading ability in a placement test administered by Brown University language department (students who declared their concentration before August 2013 are expected to demonstrate proficiency at a 400 level). Since the history of art and architecture addresses issues of practice within specific historical contexts, concentrators are encouraged to take at least 1 studio art course. Courses in history also train students in methods and approaches that are highly relevant to the history of art and architecture. Study abroad can be a valuable enrichment of the academic work available on campus, in that it offers opportunities for first-hand knowledge of works of art and monuments as well as providing exposure to foreign languages and cultures. Study abroad should be planned in consultation with the concentration advisor in order to make sure that foreign course work will relate meaningfully to the concentrator's program of study.DECLARATIONBrown students usually choose and declare their concentrations towards the end of the fourth semester of the Sophomore year.  After you decide to concentrate in History of Art or Architectural Studies the first step is to declare your concentration.  To do that you need to go to:  http://ask.brown.edu/home/.  During this process you should talk with the Concentration Advisor to set up your plans.REQUIREMENTSPlease note:  courses that fulfill concentration requirements must be taken for a letter grade.10 courses (11 for honors)6 core courses which must be taken in the Department4 elective courses, includingA maximum of 2 outside credits will be awarded for courses taken outside the Department or at other universities (transfer credits or from study abroad programs), or for courses that also count towards a second concentration. No concentration credit will be given for High School AP, Subsidiary AP, A level (etc.) courses. No concentration credit for language courses.Our limit of 2 concentration credits for courses taken outside the Department is based on a positive goal. We encourage you to benefit from the cohesive program that the Department offers. Beyond the 10-course minimum you are free to engage with all the rich resources of Brown, RISD, and the world. When an important opportunity comes along for you to follow your interests you should feel free to talk with the Department concentration advisor about finding the best ways to work that opportunity into the concentration, or think about turning it into a Capstone experience (see below).Language requirementThis may be fulfilled with a recent placement test demonstrating that you have attained a reading level equivalent to passing a 500 level course, or by passing a 500 level language class at Brown or elsewhere, with a transcript grade that will become part of your record. It is worth repeating that the language requirement opens for you a whole new culture and way of thinking about the world of architecture. The language requirement also prepares you for graduate work in the history of art and architecture.Assessment: All concentrators are required to write an essay when they declare the concentration that discusses how they expect to develop intellectual or practical skills from the course of study they propose. All second semester seniors will by required to write a final essay that takes the measure of what they have learned from the concentration, including their Capstone and other experiences relating to their study of history of art and architecture. For students undertaking a Capstone project or experience, their Capstone director will read this essay. A Department subcommittee will read essays written by students not electing to do a Capstone. The self-assessment should be turned in with a revised list of courses actually taken and the final paperwork for concentration approval.The Department regularly invites scholars from outside the University to talk about their research and organizes conferences on topics related to the history of art and architecture. Attendance at these lectures and conferences is strongly encouraged.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown During the second semester of the junior year all concentrators will be invited to apply for admission to the Honor Program in History of Art and Architecture and Architectural Studies.If you are accepted into the Honors Program you will register for HIAA 1990 during the two semesters when you are working on a thesis.  HIAA 1990 carries one credit a semester. The concentration advisor must enter an override for you to register in the course. This is a seminar led by the Department Undergraduate Concentration Advisor in which all honors students meet once a month to present the current progress of their work. It is a valuable opportunity to share ideas and receive feedback from your fellow honors students and faculty alike. The honors seminar also offers a practical framework around which you can organize the progress of your work.At the beginning of your senior year you will be actively encouraged to propose and undertake a Capstone Project. The Capstone Project is intended to challenge you with an opportunity to synthesize at a high level of achievement the knowledge and understanding you have gained by concentrating in the History of Art and Architecture or Architectural Studies. To propose and work on a Capstone Project you will need the support of a faculty sponsor. Capstone Projects embrace many possibilities. You can perfect a seminar paper in which you have developed a strong interest. You can participate in a graduate seminar to which the instructor has admitted you. You can serve as an undergraduate TA. You can work as an intern in museums and auction houses such as Christie's. You might work on an archaeological excavation. You can participate in the Honors Program. Beyond these opportunities, the Department is open to other approaches. You should work with a faculty sponsor and with the Undergraduate Concentration Advisor to decide what will work best for you.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
