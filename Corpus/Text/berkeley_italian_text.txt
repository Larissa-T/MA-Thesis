Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedDuring the SummerOur summer courses are generally open for registration by anyone — not just UC Berkeley students.  We offer a variety of language and culture courses each summer, taught by qualified UCB instructors.  All summer course registration goes through the Berkeley Summer Sessions office, whose website outlines the enrollment process, tuition fees, and more.During the Academic YearWhile we are unable to offer traditional “auditing” or “sitting in on” a Fall or Spring course, the UC Extension makes it possible for non-UC Berkeley students to enroll in UC Berkeley classes through their Concurrent Enrollment program, pending instructor approval.Courses through Concurrent Enrollment can be taken for credit/letter grade, pass/no pass, or no credit; registration costs vary depending on the grading option.  For details on Concurrent Enrollment requirements, deadlines, applications and fees, please visit their web site or call 510-642-4111.For registration purposes, you will need the course control number from UC Berkeley’s official online schedule of classes.A few weeks before the class begins, it is important that the potential Concurrent Enrollment student e-mails the instructor of the course to introduce him or herself and informs the instructor of his or her plans.  Course descriptions with instructor names are posted in the Courses section of this web site.  In order to contact our instructors, please see the People page of this website.If the course you want to take is an Italian language course, especially if you are unsure which level is right for you, please contact our language coordinator for approval and information about a language assessment.In general, applications for Concurrent Enrollment are not officially approved and signed by the instructor until the first week of class, as part of the approval is based on the number of spaces available.  Once approved by the instructor, the application will go through an approval process between the UCB campus and the Concurrent Enrollment office, and finally the student will be officially enrolled and billed by the UC Extension.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents.

										NEW INTENSIVE COURSE!
EQUIVALENT OF ITALIAN STUDIES 1 AND 2 COMBINEDFOR NATIVE SPEAKERS OF SPANISH OR THOSE WITH COLLEGE LEVEL SPANISH 4 OR HIGHER (EXCEPTIONS MADE WITH DEPARTMENTAL CONSENT)This course is specifically designed with the needs and strengths of native or proficient speakers of Spanish in mind, so that the similarities between the two languages can be used to promote specific learning paths. This is an intensive Italian language course, which combines TWO semesters in ONE, covering all the materials usually covered in Italian Studies 1 and 2 of Elementary Italian. The course provides an accelerated introduction to Italian, allowing students who successfully complete it to enroll in Italian 3, gaining faster access to Upper Division courses. The general objectives are to provide students with the basic tools for oral and written communication in Italian, but also to offer them the opportunity to learn about Italian culture, to reflect on intercultural differences and similarities, and to become more aware ‘multilingual subjects’ in our plurilingual society.Workload: This course is comprised of a master lecture class, meeting 5 times per week, and a drill/conversation section, meeting 2 times per week. Regular and continued attendance of both classes is mandatory. Due to the intensive nature of this course, students should plan to study one to two hours a day and be committed to a fast-paced learning environment.Texts:

										Course conducted entirely in Italian.
Italian Studies 1 is for beginners and focuses on developing basic language skills (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) in Italian. The course is taught in Italian.

										Everyone loves the mafia – at least in films, on television, and in books. Why? And what is ‘the’ mafia? In this seminar we will explore fictional and non-fictional explanations of the mafia as an originally unique, Italian phenomenon, and as a closed social, economic, and psychological system based on brutality and secrecy. Our materials will include a few essential readings with discussion of classic films and TV representations.Prerequisite:  Freshman standing.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

										Is there an Italian Theory? What are its origins and the reasons for its popularity outside of Italy? Why do most of its protagonists, regardless of their philosophical positions, share a tense and troubled relationship with political (and religious) power? The seminar will address these and other questions and introduce students to the most important figures of modern and contemporary Italian thought. Readings will include not only Antonio Gramsci and Giorgio Agamben but a wide selection of classic authors, such as Benedetto Croce, Giovanni Gentile, Norberto Bobbio, Ernesto de Martino, Adriana Cavarero and Toni Negri. Particular attention will be given to the Italian debate on the ‘political’ (borrowing the concept from Carl Schmitt) and to the relationship between theory and politics that marked Italian philosophy from Fascism to the cold war era until today.The course is taught in English with readings in English.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

										EQUIVALENT OF ITALIAN STUDIES 1 AND 2 COMBINEDFor native speakers of ANY Romance language and for students with college level 4 proficiency (or higher) in a Romance language (exceptions made with departmental consent).
This course is specifically designed with the needs and strengths of native or proficient speakers of any Romance language in mind, so that the similarities between the languages can be used to promote specific learning paths. This is an intensive Italian language course, which combines TWO semesters in ONE, covering all the materials usually covered in Italian Studies 1 and 2 of Elementary Italian. The course provides an accelerated introduction to Italian, allowing students who successfully complete it to enroll in Italian 3, gaining faster access to Upper Division courses. The general objectives are to provide students with the basic tools for oral and written communication in Italian, but also to offer them the opportunity to learn about Italian culture, to reflect on intercultural differences and similarities, and to become more aware ‘multilingual subjects’ in our plurilingual society.Workload: This course is comprised of a master lecture class, meeting 5 times per week, and a drill/conversation section, meeting 2 times per week. Regular and continued attendance of both classes is mandatory. Due to the intensive nature of this course, students should plan to study one to two hours a day and be committed to a fast-paced learning environment.Conversation sections: Enroll in one.

					 Satisfies L&S Arts & Literature OR Historical Studies OR Social & Behavioral Sciences breadth requirement.					This interdisciplinary course is a broad-based introduction to the culture and history of the Italian peninsula, from the Middle Ages to the present day. It offers a survey of major developments in politics, music, art, architecture, cinema, literature, and various forms of popular culture. We will encounter numerous individual artists, writers and political figures, from Dante in the 1300s through Michelangelo and Verdi to Berlusconi today, placing them and their achievements in a rich social and historical context. In describing the development of Italy as a nation-state and Italians as a people, we will trace continuities and changes from the independent city-states of the medieval period through the princely courts of the Renaissance, the foreign occupations of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the nationalist movements of the 1800s, and the challenges faced by an autonomous Italy in the last century and a half, as it has experimented in turn with liberalism, colonialism, and totalitarianism, before settling down as the fractious Republic it is today.Texts: Assigned readings will be posted on bCourses; the content of lectures and PowerPoints count as part of the course ‘text’.Prerequisites: None.Workload: Weekly participation exercises and reading assignments; 2 midterm examinations and written assignments; final examination.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

					 Satisfies L&S Historical Studies OR Social & Behavioral Sciences breadth requirement.					The history of medieval Italy is one of vivid contrasts: of beauty and brutality, freedom and tyranny, piety and blasphemy. The great poet of the Inferno summons us to consider such contrasts in nearly every canto: how can such stunningly beautiful language conjure images of such horrendous violence? This course explores the world that produced Dante, Giotto, and Saint Francis. It first traces the emergence of independent city-states in northern and central Italy after the millennium, emphasizing the particular conditions and experiences that created this distinctive medieval civilization. We will then focus on the culture of these vibrant urban centers using the artifacts they produced to discover the economic, social, religious, and political tensions underpinning them.  Were the divisions and inequities of this society central to its creativity?  We will explore with particular intensity the relationship between religion and society.  Special emphasis will also be placed on analyzing material and visual sources: do they tell a different story than the written sources?  Requirements include midterm and final examinations in addition to two short essays based on primary sources.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

										This course satisfies the first half or the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. This course examines representations of childhood in American, Italian, and Northern European literature. Because we were all children once, we might think that we know very well what it is like to be a child. But can we really access the world of a child — even the world of our past child-self? Starting in the late nineteenth century, this course investigates diverse constructions of the child-figure in a range of genres, including novels, film, and short stories. Our particular focus will be the mapping of childhood spaces within the text. These include spaces that child characters create for themselves, either as a refuge from or resistance to the adult world, and spaces that adult characters create for children. As we explore the narrative function of these spaces, we will also question the desires that motivate their creation. In creating spaces for children, what meanings do adult authors and characters impose on them? How does the text encourage or undermine our own attempts to construct childhood? And how do we try to make the child characters conform to a unified explanation of the text? Tracing these geographies of childhood, we will thus study the relation between these spaces and the interpretative work of the reader. We will ask how the desire to access these spaces mimics the desire to grasp the meaning of the text.Throughout this course, we will practice the skills of critical reading and writing, which are fundamental preparation for all college work. This course is designed to fulfill the first half of the Reading and Composition requirement. We will learn not only how to read analytically, but also how to craft clear and persuasive arguments about literary texts. In addition to three essays, we will complete exercises in style and register, grammar, and the development of a thesis statement. Each essay will be produced through the course of the writing process, including an outline, rough drafts, and peer review. We will also complete several shorter writing assignments that focus on the skill of close reading.Texts Henry James, The Turn of the Screw

										The Proseminar serves as the core course for the Italian Studies graduate program, and aims to provide students with a foundation for literary study as it is practiced in the U.S.  To that end, we will read a series of foundational theoretical essays, focused on a set of key words that are themselves metonymies for major theoretical approaches. This fall, those key words will be “ideology,” “gender,” “rhetoric,” “affect,” and “animal.”  Theorists read will include Ahmed, Althusser, Barthes, Butler, Culler, De Lauretis, Derrida, Freud, Marx, Ngai, Sedgwick, Singer.    Our readings in theory will be complemented by readings in literary texts drawn from several different periods in the Italian tradition. The literary texts will offer us the occasion to test the practices of reading and methodological approaches that emerge from our discussions of theory. Authors read will include Boccaccio, Petrarca, Stampa, Franco, Verga, Foscolo, and Ortese.Students will be required to give one or two in-class presentations (depending upon the number of students enrolled), and to write two short 8-10 page papers.The course is required of M.A. students, and recommended for Ph.D. students.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

										All Reading and Composition courses must be taken for a letter grade in order to fulfill this requirement for the Bachelor’s Degree. This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.In this course students will work to develop their expository essay writing. Together we will read and discuss a number of texts and work on techniques for freewriting, paragraph-structuring, and editing essays about those texts. In our reading (works by Boccaccio, Machiavelli, and Svevo, to list a few) we will focus on the theme of the written word itself in various forms: how written language structures thought and reality. As we investigate this theme we will work our way to a central topic: empathy. Is our basic idea of the accessibility of other minds altered when we become habituated to reading and writing? Is the whole idea of the “other” and “alterity” re-cast and re-crafted when the written word is introduced? Examining these questions will bring us to parallels between intersubjectivity and temporality, between books and minds, between reading and thinking. Our goal will always be to explore complex ideas in literary and theoretical texts, and then write about those ideas in clear and effective prose.Prerequisites: Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading & Composition requirement or its equivalent.

										Conducted in English with readings in English.The seminar will explore the intensely productive, adventurous, at once anxious and delirious period in Italian cinema of the 1960s through the mid-70s. In this era the material and social transformations bound up with the economic boom, the proliferation of commodity and advertising culture in tandem with the international marketing of Italy’s luxury image, the rise of television and the “disappearance of the fireflies,” the student movements and the surge of left and right wing terrorism stimulated some of the most innovative work in world cinema. This Italian “New Wave,” distinct from its French counterpart, responded to the host of political and cultural upheavals with new visions of urban space and industrial design, heightened dramas of social and sexual mores, critical recollections of the past, and dreams of revolution. Alongside exemplary works by Antonioni, Bellocchio, Bertolucci, Fellini, Leone, Pasolini, Rosi, and the Tavianis, we will consider experiments in the poetic documentary and the radical Cinegiornali initiatives, the phenomenon of anthology films, and the implications of international co-productions as part of our discussion of the altered environments and demographics, the shifting values of “high” and “low,” the ideological climate and visual culture of the period defined between the sensation of La dolce vita and the murder of Pier Paolo Pasolini. Attendance in screenings required; all principal readings are in English.Prerequisites: Graduate standing; consent of instructor.Screenings:

										All Reading and Composition courses must be taken for a letter grade in order to fulfill this requirement for the Bachelor’s Degree. This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.A good neighbor may knock on your door the day you move in and greet you with a fresh-baked pie. A bad neighbor might spy on your household from behind the curtains. When it comes to a neighborhood, whether doors are left open or not, the border between domestic and public space is porous and far from peacefully established. A neighborhood can be a community as much as a place of social tension in which proximity only masks dissonance. Although neighbors look at the world from a same portion of a city, chances are they see it very differently.This summer we’ll take a tour of Italy through novels of the 20th century and films that thematize the neighborhood as a space of encounter, appropriation, and exchange. Layers of history, laws, wars, gentrification, emigration, compose the stratified stories of each quartiere that we will explore. The coursework will stimulate reflections on a variety of themes across the architectural and social boundaries of urban, suburban and peripheral realities: political power and patriarchy, multiculturalism and racism, urbanization and nature, labor and consumption, the local and the global.We’ll discuss narratives that spring from the periphery of a community or a neighborhood. We’ll explore “extreme” living conditions, as they appears in Carlo Levi’s 1946 novel Christ stopped in Eboli, or in the postwar Neorealist film The Roof  by Vittorio De Sica. In other cases, we’ll discuss radical ideological and cultural standing points that compromise the very notion of coexistence, as in Amara Lakhous’ novels’ multicultural piazza, or in Ettore Scola’s film A Special Day, set in two apartments facing each other in fascist era Rome.Since this is a Reading and Composition course, our primary goal is to develop and hone our skills as active readers and analytical writers. To this end, students will be expected to thoroughly read all assigned texts, attend class regularly, participate in class discussion, and complete a variety of written assignments.Texts:J.G.

This course satisfies the first half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.What is a story? What assumptions do we make when we read a story? In other words, what conventions, techniques, or practices of narration are there to which we have become so accustomed that they seem invisible or taken for granted? Who talks and how? When does one “talk” in a narrative? How do narratives or stories sustain an illusion of reality? What happens when we have a work of literature that challenges or subvert these conventions?This course will investigate a diverse group of modern texts, such as Calvino’s If On A Winter’s Night a Traveler, texts which all center around or are structured by a mystery (missing persons in or misplaced manuscripts); above all, these texts also manipulate, challenge, and upend the conventions of narrative. In other words, there is the mystery in the text as well as the mystery of the text itself.Narratives (Not Comprehensive):

This course satisfies the first half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.This summer, we’ll take a virtual tour of Italy’s capital as seen through the eyes of natives and foreigners alike. Drawing on fiction, film, poetry, and other cultural artifacts, we’ll approach the Eternal City not only as the static setting against which stories and histories unfold, but as a dynamic protagonist in its own right. “Rome” will therefore serve as a lens through which to consider broader questions related to Italian history, cultural identity, and our conceptualization of the city itself, as both a geographical reality and a space constructed by the imagination. Some of the questions we will address are: How is the “città eterna” appropriated as simultaneously a constant and fluctuating entity, a static emblem of history and a corrupting modern metropolis at once? What does it mean to author a city and how have writers and filmmakers taken on this role? How does Rome become a character of its own, one approached with an amalgam of loving curiosity, intolerance, even indifference? What kind of modern subject walks the Roman streets and how do they interact with it?Since this is a Reading and Composition course, our primary goal is to develop and hone our skills as active readers and analytical writers.

The seminar Trionfi/Triumphs will examine a variety of triumphal gestures in history: Rites, processions, monuments, and iconographies from ancient Roman triumphs to the present day. Stations of this cultural history investigation include: Ancient arches and their decoration, booty and spolia, Christian medieval adaptations in rites and reliquaries, Renaissance triumphs in painting, print, and literature (Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio), iconic imagery of triumphs (Mantegna, Dürer, Rubens), the Latino tradition of religious processions, operatic adaptations, Fascist triumphal imagery under the direction of Mussolini and Leni Riefenstahl, and other modern examples oftriumphs and reversals in contemporary Italian cinema such as in Roberto Benigni’s La vita è bella.Depending on the students’ backgrounds, interests, and level of Italian language skills, the course will usually combine some introductory remarks with the discussion of readings and artworks. Students will contribute small presentations on a text and an artwork throughout the term, and present their seminar paper topic to the group towards the end of class.Prerequisites: Graduate standing or consent of instructor.You should have read Petrarch’s Triumphs (in English or Italian) at least once in your life before the beginning of our seminar meetings.The course will be taught in English with readings in English and Italian. Readings in Italian will be discussed striking for balance between the participating students’ overall knowledge of Italian and the authenticity of the original texts. This means that we will sometimes look very closely into the original Italian for textual analysis, but do so communicating in English.Main texts: Petrarch’s Trionfi, ideally in the original (Francesco Petrarca: Rime, trionfi, e poesie latine. Ed. F. Neri. Milan 1951) and in a trusted English translation (Triumphs of Petrarch. Translated by Ernest H. Wilkins. Chicago 1962). Please read the triumphs at least once in an English translation before the first day of seminar as we will discuss your first reading experience of this text. Readings will furthermore include texts by Dante, Boccaccio, secondary literature on the art historical contents (Mantegna, Dürer, Rubens), architectural studies of ancient, Renaissance, and modern arches and sculptural relief, the history of triumphs (Mary Beard: The Roman Triumph. Cambridge, MA, and London 2009) and their application in the arts (Margaret Ann Zaho: Imago Triumphalis: The Function and Significance of Triumphal Imagery for Italian Renaissance Rulers. New York et al. 2004), as well as the screenplay-format novel of La vita è bella (Roberto Benigni and Roberto Cerami: La vita è bella. Turin 1998.).Pdfs of all the central readings will be made available on bCourses or as hardcopies in class6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2015 UC Regents.

					 Satisfies L&S Arts & Literature breadth requirement.					Cross-listed with Film 140, Section 3.In 1975, Italy was, in one journalist’s words, “deep in crisis.” The postwar economic boom known as the miracolo italiano had given way to the long “Years of Lead,” marked by stagnation and foreign debt as well as by unrelenting political violence: routine kidnappings and assassinations, coups planned and exposed, neo-fascists clashing with left-wing militants. And while activists continued to work for economic justice, women’s liberation, and the end of what was already being called American empire, their revolutionary projects became increasingly difficult to sustain.These desperate times called for desperate cinematic measures. So in 1975 Italian filmmakers went to new—and often unlikely—extremes. They experimented with endless-seeming long takes and scenes of mind-numbing boredom. They found new ways to frame brutal violence and to show what happens when such violence saturates everyday life. They devised incongruous and troubling generic hybrids like the “unwatchable” art film, or the comedy about the Holocaust.In this course, we’ll study these and other cinematic responses to the Italian crisis. In order to look deep into—even at the risk of dwelling in—this crisis, we’ll attend closely to films made in Italy in 1975 alone. But we’ll also discuss films from elsewhere that let us situate the Italian case in a global context. We’ll ask what it means that so many of that year’s films, both in Italy and internationally, produce a sense of claustrophobia and closure, on the one hand, and cataclysm or even world-ending, on the other. How does film form relate to historical transition and social conflict? How have directors both registered and resisted states of stagnation, and how have they challenged us to imagine transformation?Many of the films that we’ll consider—from documentary to dark comedy and from the exquisite to the deliberately opaque—deploy radical strategies that remain resonant and engage with debates that are still relevant to art and activism today, including debates on decolonization, race, “women’s work” or reproductive labor, the legacies of fascism, the ravages of capitalism, and the meaning of revolution.We will study films by Ackerman, Antonioni, Celentano, Duras, Gerima, Guzmán, Losey, Lumet, Mills, Monicelli, Pasolini, Rocha, Sembene, Straub and Huillet, Visconti, and Wertmüller. A required course reader will include texts from the period by Berger, Federici, Fortini, Mulvey, Negri, Sontag, Truffaut, and Tronti, among others, as well as more recent critical and historical essays.Prerequisites:  None. 6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

										This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. This course is about revolutions that might have taken place but didn’t, or that almost were but weren’t, in Italy from the Napoleonic era to the early twenty-first century. The (non-)events known as rivoluzioni mancate, or missing revolutions, occupy a privileged place in many accounts of Italian history and culture, including accounts of national unification, fascism and its aftermath, industrialization, and decolonization. As we consider the importance and implications of such missing revolutions, we’ll also attend to the various meanings both of “revolution” and of “missing.” We’ll ask, for instance, not only what it means to say that a revolution has been missed, like an appointment or a deadline, but also what happens when we come to miss moments of revolutionary energy—because this energy seems to have gone missing, like a lost dog, or to have become a thing of the past.Poetry has long been defined as the kind of writing that both preserves and prefigures still unrealized possibilities. (According to Aristotle, “the historian relates what happened, the poet what might happen.”) We will therefore return repeatedly to poets’ attempts to imagine revolution in the Italian context, even while we also consider the work of filmmakers, novelists, essayists, and critics. We’ll study works by Antonioni, Bellocchio, Berger, Bertolucci, Fortini, Foscolo, Gramsci, Pasolini, Rosselli, Rossellini, and Sontag, among others.This is a writing-intensive course, which means that, even as we locate and learn to value unrealized potentials in literature and cinema, we will seek to realize our own potential as writers through frequent writing assignments and focused revision.Texts:  to be announced.Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading & Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.   6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

Il periodo fascista è spesso chiamato ‘il ventennio nero,’ come se fosse un incubo nella memoria nazionale, un incubo che comunque è servito (e serve ancora) come punto di partenza per l’articolazione del sogno risorgimentale/partigiano di una ‘nuova Italia.’ Perciò non ci dovrebbe sorprendere che gli studi sul periodo si focalizzino spesso sugli eventi più tragici, sulle stragi, le leggi razziali, la guerra, eccetera.In questo corso sul periodo fascista, analizzeremo testi e film che seguono invece una vena comica ed ironica, come i film di Camerini e Malasomma, e proveremo a leggere le tensioni sociali del periodo fascista attraverso opere che a prima vista sembrano non impegnati politicamente.Il corso sarà condotto in italiano, con letture in italiano ed in inglese.Course requirements: Durante il semestre, gli studenti dovranno scrivere brevi saggi, fare 1-2 presentazioni, e consegnare un progetto finale.Texts: Forthcoming.Prerequisites: Italian 101A or B or consent of instructor6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2015 UC Regents.

Since as far back as the Renaissance, Italy has been the destination of an infinite number of travelers, students, artists and the curious, who visited the peninsula to discover its artistic and natural patrimony in order to complete their education. This seminar will guide students through some of the most famous travel accounts of the Western canon (by Albrecht Dürer, William Shakespeare, Michel de Montaigne, Stendhal, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and Mark Twain, among others) and reconstruct why travelers from different epochs and different backgrounds shared the same fascination with Italy. The texts read in class will also provide an opportunity to discover some of the actual sites that they describe: from the Roman ruins to Renaissance and Baroque art up to the new phase of urban development that began after Italy’s unification (1861). Finally, the course will also introduce the students to important resources present on the Berkeley campus, alternating lectures and discussion sessions in the class room with visits to museums and libraries.The course is taught in English with readings in English.Prerequisites:  none.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.

While admittance to the M.A. does not guarantee subsequent permission to enter the Ph.D. program, the Department does not admit students who apply for a terminal M.A. degree program. The requirements below correspond to the University’s Plan II M.A. degree program. The Department does not offer Plan I.The Graduate division defines academic residence as payment of registration fees and enrollment in at least 4 units in 100 or 200 series courses for a minimum of two semesters. However, the time needed for completion of the M.A. degree in Italian Studies is normally 1.5 to 2 years of full time registration as defined below.The minimum enrollment requirement for all graduate students who are not yet advanced to doctoral candidacy is 12 units per semester. Usually, units are in regular graduate seminars (4-credit, 200 series courses) though in some cases, students may require some undergraduate work to meet pre-requisites.
Students with academic appointments (as Graduate Student Instructors, Readers, and Tutors) must also be registered in 12 units per semester, though 4 of these units will usually be in the 300 series.The Department of Italian Studies requires a minimum of 24 units of coursework in 100 and 200 series courses for the Master’s degree. At least half of these units, and usually more, are earned in graduate seminars. Some work may be done in upper division undergraduate courses to supplement an incoming student’s undergraduate preparation.Students are required to take a minimum of 12 units per semester, which must include at least 8 units of graduate seminars or advanced undergraduate classes. Up to 8 units from approved non-Department courses may be applied toward Department requirements. An additional 4 units of coursework in literary theory may also be taken outside the Department. In no case may the student do more than 50% of her or his work outside the Department.Specific course requirements include: Italian Studies 290A-B: Graduate Colloquium (2 units each, may be taken S/U)Italian Studies 205: Proseminar in Italian Literary Studies (currently offered in alternate years, must be taken for 4 letter graded units)Three 4-unit letter graded seminars (with final research papers) covering 3 of 4 historical periods:In addition, a student who is serving as a GSI for the first time is required to enroll in Italian Studies 355 (Seminar in Language Pedagogy) for 4 units. In later semesters the student who is also teaching typically enrolls in Italian Studies 302 (Colloquium in Language Pedagogy) for either 2 or 4 units. Students teaching Reading & Composition courses for the first time are required to enroll in a separate, campus-mandated pedagogy seminar.
Students preparing for the M.A. Examination may, on the recommendation of the Graduate Adviser, enroll in up to 8 units of Italian Studies 601 (Independent Study for master’s Candidates).Prior to receiving the master’s, the student is required to demonstrate advanced reading skills in one language other than Italian and English which has specific relevance to the field of Italian Studies. Students are encouraged to take advantage of Berkeley’s summer language workshop programs, for which some financial support may be available. U.S. citizens or permanent residents may be eligible for support by the FLAS grant program for foreign language study.Proficiency may be demonstrated in one of two ways (at least one language must be passed by examination):Examination: A translation exam on a passage of ~300 words. The Department of Spanish and Portuguese administers exams in Spanish, French, Catalan, German, Portuguese and Latin, usually during the fifth week of each semester. A schedule and sign-up sheet are posted outside room 5309 after the third week of the semester. Students are allowed 60 minutes (75 minutes for Latin & German) and the use of a dictionary; translations must be made in ink and students must provide their own blue book. Past exams are kept in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. For other languages special arrangements must be made.Coursework: Latin proficiency is established by passing Latin 10 and Latin 100 (or another upper-division course) with minimum grades of “B.” Proficiency in modern languages is established by passing two upper division language courses (100 series) or one graduate course (200 series) taught in the language, with minimum grades of “B.” Language courses below the 100 series do not count toward the departmental coursework requirement; no more than 4 units total of upper-division and graduate courses may be so counted.The M.A. Examination is taken at the end of the 3rd semester or beginning of the 4th, and in any case no later than April 15th during the fourth semester of academic residence. The Examining Committee is composed of three members, at least two of whom are regular faculty in the Department of Italian Studies. The Committee is chosen by the Graduate Adviser in consultation with the student and the prospective members. Students planning on taking their M.A. exam must file a Request for Advancement to Master’s Candidacy with the Graduate Assistant by September 15th for a Fall exam/December degree and February 10th for a Spring exam/degree. The form must be signed by the Graduate Adviser and Chair of the exam committee, and the approved reading list must be sent with the signed form.The examination is based on an individually tailored list of a minimum of 30 representative items drawn from the entire length of the Italian cultural tradition (including, but not necessarily limited to, literature). The list is to be devised by the student, in consultation with the Graduate Adviser (and other faculty as necessary), and may include material studied in coursework. An “item” need not be a text: verbal documents of all kinds, paintings, buildings, sculptures, musical compositions, movies, and other cultural phenomena may also be considered “items.” Items should be considered in historical and socio-cultural context; the reading of at least one comprehensive history of Italian literary culture — e.g. Ferroni or The Cambridge History of Italian Literature — is required. The list as a whole must meet minimum standards of substance and coverage in terms of chronology and genre; it should be finalized and approved before the semester in which the exam is taken.The written exam is not the exclusive basis for determining whether a student’s performance has merited the M.A. degree. It is part of a portfolio developed by the candidate over the whole course of his or her enrollment in the master’s program, performance in each part of which must be deemed satisfactory before the degree can be awarded.The Portfolio consists of:
1) two seminar papers, chosen and revised at the student’s discretion, demonstrating achievement in research and scholarship. These must be presented to the committee four weeks before the written examination.
2) the written examination
3) achievement in coursework
4) achievement in teaching, if relevantThe Format of the Examination: The candidate is given a period of twelve hours in which to write answers to three questions from a list of five devised by the Examination Committee and based upon the student’s list. (There is no oral component to the exam.) The Graduate Assistant (or other designated person) will email the questions to the student, who must return the finished exam within 12 hours. A successful exam will be between 6000 and 7500 words; ideally, it will also include the student’s name and page numbers.The results of the M.A. exam and portfolio review, as determined by the Committee, will be given to students within two weeks of the exam. After successfully passing the review, the student can request “permission to proceed” to the Ph.D. program. Otherwise the exam may be retaken one time only, no later than two weeks before the end of the term following the one in which it was first taken. On a similar timetable, other elements of the portfolio may be resubmitted, as determined by the M.A. Examination Committee. The exam may not be taken a third time; failure on the retake will lead to dismissal from the program.If the student wishes to continue to the Ph.D., she or he must submit a request for “permission to proceed” to the Graduate Committee within 2 week of being notified of passing the M.A. (In Italian Studies, the Graduate Committee comprises the entire faculty.) The request should be 500 to 1000 words long, and describe the student’s goals and expectations for the Ph.D. program, specifying primary and secondary fields. The request should include the comments the student received on the M.A., and one representative research paper. Permission will not be granted if the student has more than one Incomplete grade.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Ph.D. program builds upon a broad knowledge of Italian literature and culture from the 13th century to the present (such as that acquired at the MA level), providing advanced training in the interdisciplinary field of Italian Studies, and culminating in the dissertation. Fulfilling technical requirements of residence, coursework, and examinations is not sufficient for the degree. The Ph.D. is conferred in recognition of the candidate’s overall mastery and original research and contribution.The Graduate division defines academic residence as payment of registration fees and enrollment in at least 4 units in 100 or 200 series courses for a minimum of two semesters. However, the time needed for completion of the Ph.D. degree in Italian Studies is normally 4 years.New and continuing students must be registered by the end of the third week of classes. The minimum enrollment requirement for all graduate students who are not yet advanced to doctoral candidacy is 12 units per semester. Of these, at least 8 are typically in graduate seminars (4-credit, 200 series courses). All fellowship recipients and students holding a GSI or GSR appointment supplemented by department funding (e.g. fee balance) must also register for a minimum of 12 units.Ph.D students in Italian Studies take 2-3 years of coursework beyond the M.A., the exact number of units depending upon the nature of their M.A. (or equivalent) experience. Students permitted to proceed after the Berkeley M.A. in Italian Studies are required to complete 28 units of coursework in the 100 and 200 series. Students entering from another institution or from another Berkeley M.A. program may be required to complete an additional 1 or 2 semesters (12-24 units) of coursework in order to broaden their training, or to fulfill outstanding requirements (for example, language).Required courses must be taken for a letter grade and distributed as follows:a) Primary field (minimum 8 units): The primary field may be a two hundred year period of Italian literature and culture, or a major historical phenomenon studied over the length of the Italian tradition, i.e., a genre, like lyric or drama; a problem, like the relationship of the artist to political patronage; or an interdisciplinary phenomenon, like the interplay between poetry and music. This requirement must be met in 4 unit seminars with research papers.b) Secondary field (minimum 8 units): The secondary field may be a traditional discipline or an interdisciplinary field, e.g., Anthropology, Art History, Film Studies, History, Medieval Studies, Music. This requirement must be met in 4 unit seminars with research papers.c) Prospectus Tutorial (IS 282, 4 units): In the semester before the Qualifying Exam, students prepare a preliminary dissertation prospectus, usually under the supervision of the future dissertation chair. The provisional prospectus is a concise description (15-20 pages) of the proposed dissertation project, including: primary materials to be investigated, the approach to be taken, the project’s relation to existing scholarly work, and a comprehensive bibliography.d) Pedagogy: Students holding language GSI appointments for the first time are required to enroll in Italian Studies 355 (Seminar in Language Pedagogy) for 4 units. Students teaching Reading & Composition courses for the first time are required to enroll in a separate, campus-mandated pedagogy seminar (College Writing 300 or Comparative Literature 360S) for 2 units. Subsequent GSI appointments require enrollment in a practicum (IS 302 or 303) for 2-4 units.e) Individual Studies for Doctural Students (IS 602, 1-8 units): Students preparing for the QE can enroll in up to 8 units of Italian Studies 602.f) Electives: Students are encouraged to explore elective courses inside and outside the department, particularly those addressing theory and method.g) Study Abroad: Non-native speakers of Italian are eligible for department support for a semester of study at an Italian University. This is an opportunity to practice academic Italian usage and to gain familiarity with Italian approaches to scholarship, as well as to forge scholarly networks for the future.Before taking the QE, students are required by the Graduate Division to demonstrate advanced reading ability in two languages other than English and Italian which are indispensable for doctoral research. Typically these languages are Latin, French, German, or Spanish, but in some cases students demonstrate proficiency in others (e.g., Arabic, Albanian, Romanian, Portuguese, etc.). Most students will have completed one of the language requirements in the course of their MA. Students may pass both languages by examination, or one by examination and the other by coursework (as detailed in the MA description of requirements).A provisional Prospectus produced in IS 282 (see above) will be submitted for approval to a committee composed of department Faculty, plus an external member agreed upon by the student and the Graduate Adviser. (The Graduate Division requires that all Ph.D. examination and dissertation committees include at least one non-departmental faculty member from the Berkeley campus.) The approval process takes place prior to the QE (usually at the beginning of the semester in which the QE is taken).
Students revise and develop the prospectus beyond the QE, eventually presenting the completed dissertation prospectus at the department colloquium. In the process, they continue to consult with the eventual dissertation director and committee.The Qualifying Examination is required for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. and the dissertation writing stage, and it usually takes place during the 4th semester after entrance to the Ph.D. program. Students are tested in three areas: the primary field and two special topics, and the examination consists of written and oral components. In order to meet the requirements of Normative Time, the QE must be taken by the end of the 8th semester of full-time enrollment at Berkeley. The student must be registered during the semester in which the QE takes place.Examination committee: At least one year before the proposed QE date, the Graduate Adviser composes a QE committee in consultation with the student. The committee consists of at least four members of the Berkeley Academic Senate, two of whom must be Department faculty, and one of whom must be in another Department. The QE chair cannot go on to chair the student’s dissertation.Examination lists: Six months before the proposed QE date the student submits detailed proposed bibliographies for approval: a.) the primary field of specialization, and b.) two special topics. The special topics are defined in consultation with the QE committee and approved by the Graduate Adviser. At least one of them should be closely related to the student’s secondary field. The other is most often related to readings done in the Prospectus Tutorial (IS 282). Examination lists should be comprehensive with respect to primary and secondary sources. After approval, the student may request changes, but committee members cannot require alterations once the QE semester has begun. Reading lists and questions from past examinations are on file in the department library.The written examination: The written examination consists of three sections of 8 hours each, taken within one week. Exam #1 will be on a special topic with an interdisciplinary component and a significant relation to the student’s secondary field. Exam #2 will be on a special topic deriving from the student’s primary field, in most cases with a significant relationship to the focus of the student’s dissertation. Exam #3 will be a general examination over the student’s primary field list. In each case the student will answer one question from a choice of two. The student will be informed within one week as to whether she or he has passed, and may proceed to the oral component; the committee will also provide comments in writing. If any part of the written exam is not a pass, it must be retaken before the oral can be taken.The oral examination: takes place within two weeks of the written examination. It lasts up to three hours and covers the written examinations and the lists on which they were based. While the Prospectus is not subject to examination, the QE may conclude with a discussion of the student’s evolving plans for the dissertation. A failed exam may be repeated one time only, with approval of the exam committee and the Dean of the Graduate Division. A student who is not recommended for a retake or fails the exam a second time, is dismissed from the program.Upon passing the Qualifying Examination, the student advances to doctoral candidacy by filing the Application for Candidacy (Plan B), available from the Graduate Services Degrees unit (318 Sproul Hall) or through the Graduate Division web site. The form requires the names of the student’s dissertation committee members. A dissertation committee must include a minimum of two members of the department and one from another department (and all must be members of Berkeley’s Academic Senate). (Reminder: the chair of a student’s oral exam cannot also chair the dissertation committee.)Shortly after the QE, students meet with their committee members to review their plans for the dissertation. Before writing the dissertation, they update and revise the prospectus as called for, and submit it for approval by the department.The approved prospectus is presented formally in the departmental colloquium in the semester folowing the QE. The presentation usually lasts 30 – 45 minutes and is followed by questions and comments from the group.The dissertation must make an original and substantial contribution to knowledge. This is usually done by the discovery of new information; the combination or synthesis of previously unconnected facts; the production of new interpretations of cultural material; the application of theory to literary, linguistic, artistic, cultural or historical phenomena; the extension of methodology characteristic of a particular discipline into the subject area of some other discipline or disciplines; or some combination of the above. It must consist of a work of connected expository prose and observe standard scholarly conventions of annotation and bibliography. While the student will seek advice from the dissertation committee (and other sources) while writing the dissertation, the final result must be his or her own unaided work. Good advice on all these matters is available in publications such as Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, 7th ed. (2007), and current editions of the Chicago Manual of Style and the MLA Style Manual.No minimum (or maximum!) length is stipulated for the dissertation; but the Department of Italian Studies considers it unlikely that, in normal circumstances, a contribution to knowledge of the substance necessary for the conferral of the Ph.D. can be made in under 150 pages.Students submit chapter drafts as they progress, and a completed draft of the dissertation must be submitted (at the latest) two months before Graduate Division’s filing deadline, allowing for final comments and revisions. The student must be registered or on Filing Fee status in order to file for the degree.Everything you need to know about The University of Claifornia standards and regulations for preparing, organizing, and filing your Dissertation is found on the Graduate Division web page under Policies and Procedures: http://grad.berkeley.edu/policies/index.shtml.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents.

The information can be released, provided it is available in the office. The information will not be released if a student requests in writing that it not be disclosed as a matter of public record.Confidential records: All other records, such as general correspondence, admission applications, university fellowships and grants, record of employment, educational test scores, etc., are confidential.Access by the student: Students have the right to inspect their own confidential records provided they present adequate identification. Letters of recommendation and statements of evaluation dated before January 1, 1975, are not disclosed since these are not covered by congressional legislation. Access to a student’s record will normally be granted within 10 working days after the request. Copies of records that can be released will be made by the staff for 10 cents a copy. All copies will be identified with a Department stamp.Access by a third party: Disclosure to a third party can be made only with the written consent of the student, naming the third party, the records to be released, and the reasons for the disclosure.Challenge of records: The Department staff will interpret and explain the information in a student’s record at the student’s request. If a student believes that his or her records include data which are inaccurate, misleading, inappropriate, or otherwise in violation of the student’s rights of privacy, the student should follow the department appeals procedures.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents.

Follow all instructions on establishing residency provided by the UCB Residency Office http://registrar.berkeley.edu/current_students/residency.html.Obtain a California driver’s license or ID card and to cancel driver’s licenses issued by other states, even if you don’t expect to drive while in California. Register your car in California. Register to vote in California. Keep receipts of your moving expenses, bank account records, rental leases, etc. in a safe place and be prepared to produce copies to the Residency Office at the end of the spring semester. It is essential that you be able to document that you were in the state of California BEFORE the first day of fall classes and did not leave the state during holiday breaks. (If your academic program requires you to leave the state, you must request special permission to do so; consult the Graduate Adviser and the Graduate Assistant before making any such plans or commitments.)University and Department fellowships cover non-resident tuition for U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents for the first academic year only. International students without green cards and/or who are not married to a U.S. citizen are not eligible to obtain California residency.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents.

Students who have advanced to Ph.D. candidacy and begun working on their dissertations will sign up for 299 courses which will be on a S/U basis. The university requires that graduate students maintain at least a 3.0 grade point average (B grade or better).Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Option: By university requirement no more than one third of all Berkeley units in the 100 and 200 series (excluding 299) may be taken on a S/U basis. By Departmental requirement, 4-unit 200 series courses may not be taken for S/U (excluding 299 and, under certain conditions, 298).  It is important for first-year students to take courses on a letter-graded basis in order to establish a grade-point average for future fellowship and academic appointment consideration. While auditing of courses is not encouraged by the Department or the University, it may be done on occasion by permission of individual instructor.Incomplete grades: If you have incurred any incomplete grades in courses required for the M.A. or Ph.D. degrees, you are responsible for clearing these grades promptly. Though you may still participate in the M.A. exams, you will not be awarded an M.A. degree until the Graduate Assistant can confirm that incomplete grades have been removed for all required courses.No student will be conferred an M.A. with more than one incomplete grade on the transcript. The Graduate Committee will not review readiness to enter the Ph.D. program until the student has removed all but one Incomplete grade from the transcript.No student is allowed to take the QE, advance to Ph.D. candidacy, teach or hold a GSR appointment with more than two incomplete grades.  Incomplete grades must be discussed in the annual fcontinued funding request and the admission to Ph.D. review.In order to resolve an incomplete the student must provide a Petition to Remove an Incomplete Grade form (available at http://registrar.berkeley.edu/ ) to the instructor of the course. All Incomplete grades received remain on the transcript in perpetuity though the letter grade also appears once it is recorded.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedPurpose and Scope: The purpose of this procedure is to afford graduate students in the Italian Studies Department an opportunity to resolve complaints about dismissal from graduate standing, placement on probationary status, denial of readmission, and other administrative or academic decisions that terminate or otherwise impede progress toward academic or professional degree goals.The scope of this procedure is limited to the matters listed above, and excludes complaints regarding denial of admission, student records, grades in courses of instruction, student employment, student discipline, and auxiliary student services (such as housing, child care, etc.). This procedure may not be used for complaints regarding actions based solely on faculty evaluation of the academic quality of a student’s performance, or decanal evaluations of a student’s appropriate academic progress, unless the complaint alleges that the actions may have been influenced by non-academic criteria.Informal Resolution Procedures: A student may pursue informal resolution of a complaint by scheduling a meeting with the Graduate Adviser or the Department Chair to discuss the complaint and explore possible avenues of resolution. Attempts to resolve a complaint informally should be completed within thirty days. At any point in this process, if a satisfactory solution cannot be reached, the student may initiate formal resolution by putting the complaint in writing.Formal Resolution: A written complaint must include information regarding the action being complained of and the date it occurred, the grounds upon which the appeal is based, and the relief requested. The complaint must be based on one or more of the following grounds:A written complaint must be received by the Graduate Adviser within thirty days from the time the student knew or could reasonably be expected to have known of the action that is the subject of the complaint. The Department should complete its investigation and notify the student of the outcome of the complaint within sixty days of the date it was received.The time frame for filing a written complaint may be extended by the Department if the student has been involved in continuing efforts toward informal resolution, and the informal resolution process was initiated within thirty days of the time the student knew or could reasonably be expected to have known of the action that is the subject of the complaint. All time frames referred to in this procedure refer to calendar days. Summer and inter-semester recesses are not included within these time frames.Upon receipt of a written complaint, the Graduate Adviser will assign an individual to investigate the complaint and make a recommendation to (the Department Chair) regarding the outcome of the complaint. Generally, the investigation will include an interview with the complainant, a review of any relevant written materials, and an effort to obtain information from available witnesses (i.e. interviews or written statements or documents). The Graduate Adviser will notify the student in writing of the outcome of the complaint. A written complaint under this procedure satisfies the requirement of a unit level resolution process pursuant to the Graduate Appeals Procedure.Appeal to Graduate Division: If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint under the Department procedure, she or he may bring the complaint to the Formal Appeal Procedure of the Graduate Appeals Procedure. The formal appeal must be received in the Office of the Dean of the Graduate Division within fifteen days of the date of the written notification of the result of the departmental procedure. Copies of the Graduate Appeals Procedure may be obtained from the Office of the Dean of the Graduate Division.If the complaint is about an action taken by the Graduate Adviser, the complainant may elect to take the complaint directly to the Department Chair (or Department executive committee). If the student is still not satisfied with the outcome, the student may take the complaint to the Formal Appeal stage of the Graduate Appeals Procedure.Complaints Involving Discrimination: If the complaint involves allegations of discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex, race, national origin, color, age, religion, sexual orientation, or disability, the Department should consult the appropriate campus compliance officers prior to commencing informal or formal resolution. The names, phone numbers and campus addresses of these individuals are listed in various campus publications and may be obtained from the Office of the Dean of the Graduate Division or the Academic Compliance Office at (510) 642-2795.Other Complaint Procedures: Graduate students may contact the Office of the Ombudsperson for Students at (510) 642-5754, the Title IX Compliance Officer, or the 504/ADA Compliance Officer for assistance with complaint resolution. There also are other complaint resolution procedures available to graduate students for complaints that do not fall under this procedure listed in the Graduate Division Appeals Procedure.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Department of Italian Studies is committed to the interdisciplinary study of Italian literature and culture, and its diverse faculty includes scholars of literature, history, music, anthropology, art history, and cinema. Our special strengths are in medieval and early modern literature and culture, nineteenth and twentieth century literature and culture, feminist theory, Fascism and culture, literary and cultural theory, anthropology, historiography, gender studies, national and regional identity politics, comparative studies with other Romance traditions, and travel literature.The M.A. phase is designed to provide students with a broad base in Italian literature and culture, before they go on to more specialized work toward the Ph.D. Master’s students typically complete two years of coursework, and undergo a review at the end of four semesters. The review includes a written M.A. examination, as well as an evaluation of the written work produced during this phase.Note that we do not accept applications for an MA-only degree. It is also important to note that University policy prevents us from considering applicants who already hold a doctoral degree in any subject, whether obtained at a US institution or abroad.The Ph.D. phase gives students the opportunity to work across disciplines and fashion their own version of interdisciplinary Italian Studies. A special feature of this phase is the two tutorials undertaken in the final year of coursework. These tutorials allow students to work closely with faculty members who represent their areas of specialization, and provide the basis for the Qualifying Examination. Two years of coursework are typically required in this phase, which culminates in the writing of a Dissertation.Please read the INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE APPLICATION before beginning the on-line application.

Applicants choose one of the languages taught in those departments as their primary emphasis, and once admitted, take courses and satisfy program requirements in all three departments. Students must also choose between focusing their studies on literature in at least three Romance languages, or on Romance linguistics. Please see full details of the Program in Romance Languages and Literatures Italian emphasis at: http://romancelangs.berkeley.edu/.Medieval Studies: Medieval studies are currently undertaken in a joint degree program designed to preserve the established standards of training in a major subject, while broadening the student’s experience in other aspects of the field. In addition to the requirements of the Slavic Department, each student pursues seminar work in two outside departments, one of which is History. The program includes a special examination in Latin, consisting of representative passages from medieval authors. More information is available at: http://medieval.berkeley.edu/.The Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory: The DE in Critical Theory permits interested students to specialize in critical theory, and to obtain certification of this specialization, while pursuing a Ph.D. in an established UC Berkeley Department. Critical Theory is not an independent degree granting program. Students admitted to the DE and completing the requirements will receive a parenthetical notation to that effect on their doctoral degrees. See http://townsendlab.berkeley.edu/critical-theory.Designated Emphasis in Film: The Designated Emphasis in Film Studies provides curricular and research resources for students who want to concentrate on film within their respective disciplines and have their work formally recognized. Applicants to this program must have taken the Film Theory seminar offered each fall semester and must fulfill specific course, Qualifying Exam and Dissertation Committee requirements if admitted to the program. See http://fm.berkeley.edu/.Designated Emphasis in Folklore: Students receiving degrees from other departments may declare a designated emphasis in Folklore Studies. The designated emphasis is designed to complement core Ph.D. programs and provides exciting opportunities for interdisciplinary study and cross-collaboration. See http://folklore.berkeley.edu/.The Designated Emphasis in Renaissance and Early Modern Studies: This DE draws on Berkeley’s exceptional faculty strength in Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. It offers comprehensive training in a wide range of departments and disciplines. Students combine seminar work in intellectual and cultural history, material culture, and languages to supplement their traditional doctoral studies. See http://rems.berkeley.edu/.The Designated Emphasis Program in Women, Gender, and Sexuality: This is an interdisciplinary program available to students who are already admitted to a graduate program at University of California, Berkeley. Taken in conjunction with Ph.D. programs in the Humanities and Social Sciences, the Designated Emphasis provides opportunities for interdisciplinary study with more than 30 faculty across the campus.

You will find courses in Italian language, literature, history, cultural studies, film, and folklore offered by the Department, both in Italian and in English. You will also discover that courses with significant Italian content are often taught in other departments and programs, including History of Art, Music, Comparative Literature, Film Studies, Anthropology, Political Science, History, and Medieval Studies. If you’re thinking of a major in Italian Studies, contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Officer as early as possible, in order to plan an individualized course of study.If you have a strong interest in things Italian but do not yet know the language, we offer a range of general education courses, both upper and lower division, including offerings that fulfill breadth requirements in Arts and Literature, Historical Studies, Philosophy and Values, and Social and Behavioral Sciences. The Department also offers reading and composition (R & C) courses.If you already have a primary major, but would like to make good use of those credits earned on the EAP program in Italy or of upper division work done in Italian Studies here at Berkeley, explore the possibility of a minor or a double major in Italian Studies. Consult our pages about majors, minors, and double majors.Always wanted to learn Italian, but just couldn’t fit in into your schedule? Check out the opportunities for summer study both here at Berkeley and abroad in Florence. In addition, the EAP offers academic year programs in Bologna, Milan, and Rome.If you’re just getting started in the study of the Italian language, or are interested in transferring from another college or university, you can get more information on this website or by speaking to the undergraduate adviser.6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents.

This year it consists of an award of $2000, to be used to fund a recent Berkeley graduate’s travel to Italy for further study, either in the summer of 2017 or for all or part of the academic year 2017-18.  All current seniors who intend to graduate in Spring 2017 are eligible to apply, as are those who graduated in Summer or Fall 2016. Applicants must have achieved passing grades in at least three courses taken in the Department of Italian Studies, at least one of which must have been taught in Italian. (Courses taken through the University of California Education Abroad Program at its sites in Italy may be counted for this purpose.) Other things being equal, those who majored or minored in Italian Studies will be given preference. Applicants should e-mail a two pages description of their travel and study plans, along with the name of at least one faculty member or GSI who is familiar with their work — please note that only the name is required; actual letters will be solicited by the Department if needed. Send your submission by Thursday April 13, 2017  to Professor Diego Pirillo, Undergraduate Faculty Advisor: dpirillo@berkeley.edu6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2014 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedDid you know?Students entering with Advanced Placement, enrichment courses taken at community colleges while in high school or both are in a perfect position to work on a double major while attending UC Berkeley. Units awarded that fulfill University requirements do not have to be counted towards the 120-130 unit maximum for the Bachelor’s Degree allowing students to remain at Berkeley for 8 semesters while acquiring two majors.Transfer students who have completed the equivalent of Italian 1-4 before admission need only complete 32 units of upper-division coursework in Italian Studies to earn a major. Students with native or extensive academic exposure to Italian may, with language proficiency screening by our Italian language program coordinator, find that they can be placed at a higher level of language study constituting a waiver of lower-level Italian courses allowing for fewer courses to be taken for the major with the possibility of acquiring a first or second major.Up to two courses can be counted for credit between two major programs at Berkeley depending how closely related the major requirements which are, in effect, two courses counting as four, making it easier to double major. There are also several majors at UC Berkeley that require 4 semesters of lower-division language that may also be applied to lower-division language requirements for Italian Studies, e.g. Political Economy, Peace and Conflicts Studies, and so on. Think 4 courses applied to 2 sets of lower-division requirements giving you a way to make double majoring work for you.Why Two Majors?Berkeley is a unique learning environment with a diversity of majors, curriculum, research, and study abroad opportunities. Our double majors study in fields as far ranging as the biological sciences, history of art, mathematics, business, history, and comparative literature. It may surprise some but many of our double majors pursue pre-med requirements and as biological science majors, are looking for a balance between fulfilling career goals and feeding their intellectual and personal interests in the study of the language and culture of one of the oldest and most fascinating countries in Western history.Have we given you something to think about?Early planning is the key.

Of all my teaching experiences, this was the most similar to the actual profession; at my school I would be given a topic, but it was my job to create the lesson plan. I taught at a Liceo Scientifico in each class of each of the five years. I can tell you that teenagers are teenagers, regardless of where in the world you are. In general it was a pleasant experience and we were able to have fun and engage with each other, but there were also kids who make you feel like talking to a wall. It’s good to read about strategies and talk to other teachers about their experience, but nothing compares to the ability to just try things out for myself to see what works.
In addition to the teaching experience, you’re living in a new country independently. The change to post-grad life is a big change, and adding the cultural and social change of a different country can be overwhelming for some people, but if you look around and try new things you’ll quickly build a new network around you. Like many things, what you will get out of this experience depends on how much work you put in.Testimonial from former participant Arthur Lei, current graduate student in Italian Studies:If I could summarize my experience in the program in one sentence, this is what I would say: “Chi insegna, impara.”6303 Dwinelle Hall - Berkeley, CA 94720-2620 - (510) 642-2979 - issa@berkeley.edu© 2016 UC Regents.
