Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedDuring the SummerOur summer courses are generally open for registration by anyone — not just UC Berkeley students.  We offer a variety of language and culture courses each summer, taught by qualified UCB instructors.  All summer course registration goes through the Berkeley Summer Sessions office, whose website outlines the enrollment process, tuition fees, and more.During the Academic YearWhile we are unable to offer traditional “auditing” or “sitting in on” a Fall or Spring course, the UC Extension makes it possible for non-UC Berkeley students to enroll in UC Berkeley classes through their Concurrent Enrollment program, pending instructor approval.Courses through Concurrent Enrollment can be taken for credit/letter grade, pass/no pass, or no credit; registration costs vary depending on the grading option.  For details on Concurrent Enrollment requirements, deadlines, applications and fees, please visit their website or call 510-642-4111.For registration purposes, you will need the class number from UC Berkeley’s official online schedule of classes.A few weeks before the class begins, it is important that the potential Concurrent Enrollment student e-mails the instructor of the course to introduce him or herself and informs the instructor of his or her plans.  Course descriptions with instructor names are posted in the Courses section of this website.  To contact our instructors, please see the People page of this website.If you are interested in a language course, especially if you are unsure which level is right for you, please contact language coordinator Karen Moller. For more information, see the Languages section of this website, and select your desired language from the menu on the left.In general, applications for Concurrent Enrollment are not officially approved and signed by the instructor until the first week of class, as part of the approval is based on the number of spaces available.  Once approved by the instructor, the application will go through an approval process between the Berkeley campus and the Concurrent Enrollment office, and finally the student will be officially enrolled and billed by the UC Extension.© 2017 UC Regents.

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. The stories told through the Viking Age and Medieval Norse literature have directly influenced and inspired the lore in modern works like The Hobbit, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Marvel Comic’s Thor. One Scandinavian legend in particular has captured popular imagination across the world: the legend of The Saga of the Vǫlsungs. The saga – rife with curses, warring kingdoms, love triangles, and (of course) dragons – has been retold over and over. Authors, screenwriters, and composers simply can’t resist a good dragon-slaying.Our reading list will sketch a genealogy of literature which cuts across national borders and historical eras. Retellings of The Saga of the Vǫlsungs are authored by familiar names, like JRR Tolkien and Richard Wagner. Some versions are by famous Scandinavian authors like Henrik Ibsen (sometimes called Norway’s Shakespeare) and Selma Lagerlöf (the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in literature). The retellings encountered in this course are hardly tired old tropes; they are moments of creativity for some of the Modern era’s most successful authors.In this composition course, we will investigate the interplay between the content of writing and the stylistic/technical aspects. The course theme of “retelling” will help to highlight the contexts of historical writing and our own moment in history. We will attempt to move questions from “How is this different?” towards “Why is this different?” Along the way, the class will discover the rich cultural heritage of Scandinavia, and how a retelling of an old Viking legend can lead to the next Hollywood blockbuster or best-selling comic book.Texts:Saga of the Volsungs translated by Jesse Byock 978-0140447385 (~70 pages / $10) Wagner’s Ring in 1848 by Edward R.

Velkomin! Modern Icelandic is the language spoken by the 300,000+ inhabitants of Iceland, a volcanic island in the middle of the North Atlantic. Iceland was settled by Viking-era settlers from Scandinavia and their slaves, who arrived from Scandinavia and the Scandinavian colonies in Great Britain and Ireland. These Vikings colonized Iceland and Greenland and, briefly, North America. While Icelandic is a Scandinavian language, closely related to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the remote location of the island and the pride that Icelanders have historically taken in their language has kept the changes in the language to a minimum since the Viking Age. This means that Icelandic has a more complicated structure than other Scandinavian languages, but it also means that learning Modern Icelandic makes it easier to learn to read Old Norse, the language of the sagas, poetry, and mythology recorded during the medieval period.Learning Outcomes:
The goal for the first year will be to comprehend spoken and written Icelandic relating to familiar, everyday topics, and to speak and write Icelandic well enough to satisfy immediate needs. In the second semester we will continue to focus on developing more advanced grammar skills, as well as readiness for basic social situations and common needs, while working on more fluent speaking and writing.Texts:(None as such; written materials provided by instructor)Course Requirements

Cross-listed with Film 160, Section 2.
Enrollment in Scandinavian 115 will count as equivalent to Film 160, Section 2 for the purposes of the Film major. Recent television production in the Nordic countries has reached a new global audience outside the media circuits (such as art-house cinema) that historically have been the more typical Nordic outlets to international markets. Successful branding of some content as “Nordic Noir” and the radical reorganization of the distribution model for international television have allowed more mainstream circulation of television content abroad, reaching a wider audience than the earlier niche appeals of Dogme 95 filmmaking, the art films of Bergman, Dreyer, and von Trier, or the “Swedish New Wave” of the 1960s. How have contemporary Nordic television series (in both Nordic Noir and other modes) created these new forms of appeal? To what degree do they form an alternative to the contemporary American practices of television production, and as a consequence, what do current Nordic television series tell us about today’s cultural configurations in the global North?To understand these questions, this course takes the idea of the “remake” as a diagnostic tool for examining for investigating the border zones between cultures. The examples range from direct, almost slavish remakes to looser forms of inspiration, but in every case a Nordic television show will be paired with a US or UK comparison piece to ask questions about cultural adaptation and translation. The course looks at this extensive “version-making” activity in order to answer questions such as: why are so many successful Nordic TV series be remade in English (and how are American and British audiences different in this regard)? What constitutes local color? What are the mechanisms of cultural and linguistic translation that allow shows to flow from a native context to a more global audience? What does one get out of watching an original that differs from watching a remake? Is one inherently better than the other?Examples investigated will include multiple episodes of television series from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Great Britain, and the U.S., presented in these configurations: Riget/Kingdom Hospital; Henning Mankells Walllander/Wallander; Forbrydelsen/The Killing; Bron-Broen/The Bridge/The Tunnel; West Wing/Borgen; Äkta människor/Humans; Okkupert/Man in the High Castle; and Skam.There are no prerequisite courses for this upper-division elective, and all materials will be either in English or in subtitled versions: no knowledge of any of the Nordic languages is required. Format of presentation will be a mixture of lecture and discussion.Short readings (academic articles and journalistic discussions of various shows) will be made available on bCourses. There are no required textbooks.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibited

With the recent publication of a new edition of the eddic corpus (Eddukvæði, ed. Jonas Kristjánsson and Vésteinn Ólason, Reykjavik, 2014), a comprehensive study of eddic metrics (The meters of Old Norse eddic poetry, Seiichi Suzuki, Berlin, 2014) and a handbook (A handbook to eddic poetry, ed. Carolyne Larrington et al., Cambridge, 2016), the time is ripe for a reconsideration of this fascinating material. In this seminar we will read, discuss and write about poetry in eddic meters, focusing in particular on the poetry of the Codex Regius manuscript (Gks 2365 4to). In particular, seminar participants can expect to:work closely with the Codex Regius manuscript (in facsimile) as well as other important manuscript sources (versions of Vǫluspá, quotations from eddic mythological poetry in Gylfaginning, eddic heroic poetry in fornaldarsögur);get to know the various editions of eddic poetry, and familiarize themselves with their advantages and disadvantages;get a basic grounding in eddic metrics – useful for comparative work with other parts of the Germanic alliterative tradition, as well as the best starting point for understanding skaldic metrics;and discuss issues in eddic scholarship, both historical and more recent.Texts:Larrington, C., Quinn, J. and Schorn, B.

Theorists of myth and mythology rarely draw on Old Norse materials and scholarship on Old Norse myth is often carried out without reference to other mythologies. Nevertheless, a number of influential applications of structuralist, ritualists and ideological approaches to Norse myth can be found. In this seminar, we will study these applications and seek apply to some of the major theories of myth and mythology of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries to the Old Norse mythological primary sources. The aim will be to see what kinds of answers they can give to questions of origin, subject matter and function of Norse myths.In addition to primary sources and specialized scholarship on Old Norse myth, readings will include works by Dumézil, Dundes, Eliade, Girard, Lévi-Strauss, Lincoln, Malinowski, and others.Texts: The Prose Edda, The mythological poems of the Poetic Edda. Both will be read in Old Norse. Secondary readings will primarily be in English.Prerequisites: At least two semesters of Old Norse language studies (or equivalent).© 2017 UC Regents.

This course satisfies the first half or the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.   This course will examine the various ghosts of Scandinavian narratives and traditions, from draugar, who creep from burial mounds or restlessly roam the sea, to spirits bound to haunt inhabited dwellings. We will move from otherworldly encounters in excerpts from medieval sagas and poems, to instances of ghostly figures in preserved folklore. The second portion of the course will focus on the ghosts of modern literature, symbolic, gothic, or otherwise, in works of Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Karen Blixen, and Selma Lagerlöf. We will end with a look at trends in contemporary fiction involving ghosts as characters or narrators, including links between spirits of the departed and the genre of crime fiction.Students will work on developing their critical reading and writing skills by analyzing central themes and questions. We will explore what is unique and universal in the Scandinavian ghost; the degree to which horror and the uncanny are combined with comfort, memory, and connections to family and the past in these figures; and the types of places and circumstances that are likely to give rise to ghosts or ghost stories.Texts: Course Reader and readings on bCoursesThe Treasure, (Herr Arnes Penningar) by Selma Lagerlöf. 978-1406934878The Elements of Style, 4th Edition by William Strunk Jr & E B White. 978-0205309023Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the UC Entry Level Writing Requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.© 2017 UC Regents.

L&S Breadth: Arts & LiteratureScandinavian 60 is a requirement for the five major concentrations in Scandinavian.What is a hero? What use were stories about heroes to the societies that produced them? What is the relationship between heroes and gods (pagan and Christian)? Does heroic narrative preserve memories of historical events? Can monsters or women be heroes? How do heroes die, and why do their stories enjoy such a long – if not altogether blameless – afterlife?Such questions guide our engagement in this course with the heroic narratives of the premodern North (c. 800-1300). This was a period of radical cultural, social and religious change in Scandinavia, from the pagan warrior societies of the Viking Age to the Christian, literate, centralized world of the Middle Ages. The course centers on the Poetic Edda, a unique medieval collection of mythological and heroic poetry whose roots reach into the Viking Age, and perhaps still further back. But we will also explore other manifestations of the northern fascination with heroes, covering topics such as the oral transmission of heroic narrative; heroes in visual culture (runestones, sculpture, jewellery); Latin-speaking Norse heroes in Saxo grammaticus’ Gesta danorum (History of the Danes); how the heroic ethos plays out in more realistic saga genres; and the late medieval flowering of heroic narrative in the romances. A look at the post-medieval reception of heroic legend, for example in contemporary media (e.g. the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, Game of Thrones, video games) and political discourse, rounds off the course.Texts:The saga of Grettir the strong, trans. by Bernard Scudder (Penguin, 2005).

L&S Breadth: Arts & Literature In this, the second part of the Old Norse language course, we practice and extend the language skills learned in Old Norse 101A. Grammar topics from 101A will be repeated and deepened as needed. Students will both prepare translations out of class and work cooperatively on translating Old Norse texts during class time.We will read a broad range of texts, intended to give a taste of the genres and styles of Old Norse prose and poetry, supplemented by secondary literature illuminating the historical context in which the primary texts were written, transmitted and read. Students will also learn how to work critically with modern editions and reference tools.By the end of the course, students will have a solid basis for literary and philological work in the Old Norse field. They should be able to read Old Norse prose fluently and decode Old Norse poetry. They should also be capable of analyzing and situating Old Norse literary works in their literary, cultural and historical contexts.Course Materials:

L&S Breadth: Historical Studies OR Social and Behavioral SciencesWhat are Nordic values? The countries of the northern Europe (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) have been caricatured in recent American political discourse as either utopian or dystopian alternatives to American culture (in that we do/don’t want to be “like Sweden” or “like Denmark”). But what are the complex cultural and historical realities that have made the contemporary Nordic region what it is today? Proceeding from three main areas of investigation (sustainable relationships to nature; values of social solidarity; and a progressive view of gender equality), the course traces the ways in which literature, drama, film, folklore, and other forms of humanistic expression have both revealed the pressure points implicit in Nordic values and in some cases contributed to their formation. Beginning its historical arc around 1650, this course traces the historical development of contemporary Nordic discussions in four main phases. We begin with the Nordic Enlightenment, which saw the decline of Danish and Swedish state power and colonization but also was an age of scientific advancement, social satire, and the growth of vernacular cultures. Next we study the nineteenth-century, where the familiar features of Scandinavian culture begin to take shape: the emergence of folk culture, the existential individual, and the new woman. These currents move forward into the early twentieth century formation of the Nordic welfare state and its design of modern political and urban environments. Finally the course will focus on the contemporary multicultural life of the North as seen through its crime fiction, popular culture, film, and television.Prerequisites:  none.© 2017 UC Regents.

All Reading & Composition courses must be taken for a letter grade in order to fulfill this requirement for the Bachelor’s Degree. This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. Place often becomes invisible in daily life. Not until we encounter a landscape or location that is somehow exceptional—a dramatic mountaintop, a sacred temple, an overwhelming city skyline—do we bring our attention to our surroundings. Whether depicting a remote, inhospitable seascape or the streets of a recently urbanized capital city, Scandinavian authors have used place as setting, symbol, and even character across a variety of genres. In this course, we will be reading texts by several major Scandinavian authors, while paying particular attention to place—the understandings of place apparent in them, the formal techniques used to depict place, and the changes that the Scandinavian relationship to place undergoes over time. We will also read several theorists of place and discuss their applicability to the Scandinavian context.As a course designed to fulfill the objectives of Reading and Composition R5B, the main purpose of this course is to prepare students to complete an independent research project. As such, we will begin discussions in class which students will learn to pursue more deeply on their own. Along the way, we will practice critical reading, posing research questions, gathering sources, taking useful notes, and formulating original arguments that are supported with evidence, and, ultimately, presenting these results in an organized research essay, composed in a compelling and readable style.Texts: Synnøve Solbakken, Bjørstjerne Bjørnsen (available through Google books)The Lady from the Sea, Henrik Ibsen (transl.

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. Satire flourished during the eighteenth century when heavy-hitting writers across Europe penned droll attacks on superstition, intolerance, and vice. In this course, we will explore how the satirical mode functioned as part of the Enlightenment project. Particular emphasis will placed on the literary history of Sweden and Denmark-Norway from 1720 to 1792. Guiding questions in the course include: when is satire subversive and when does it reinforce the status quo? How do Scandinavian satires differ from their contemporaries in Great Britain, France, and colonial America/the United States? Is there a taxonomy of satire and what formal elements are ubiquitous across satirical sub-genres? We will engage with scholarship on satire and the Enlightenment and students will write a term paper that incorporates scholarship, historical material, and one or more of the course texts.

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.  Sleek furniture, minimalist clothing, and well-lit IKEA kitchens: these are the kinds of things that come to mind when one hears the phrase “Scandinavian design.” But we can think of Scandinavian design in broader terms as well, including the “design” of society, culture, and literature. This course explores texts that both celebrate and challenge notions of “good design” in a Scandinavian context. From houses and playgrounds, to landscapes and welfare states, we will consider questions such as: What is design? Is literature designed, or does it do the designing? What, if anything, is special about Scandinavian design?Texts:  Ibsen, Ghosts

L&S Breadth: Philosophy & Values OR Arts & LiteratureThis course provides an overview and discussion of the major gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines, narratives and adventures which make up the lore collectively referred to as Scandinavian, or Norse, myth. This lore is chiefly preserved in two collections traditionally called the Poetic (or Elder) Edda and the Prose (or Younger) Edda, together with some mythical sagas. The course considers not only the myths themselves, but how we know what we know about the myths of medieval Scandinavia and nearby lands, and what we can learn about the culture of pre-Christian Scandinavia from the myths their Christian descendants left us. This course will also take a summary look at what we know about cognate traditions elsewhere in Northern Europe, especially England and Germany.Learning Outcomes
Students will finish the course with a comprehensive knowledge of pre-Christian Scandinavia’s mythology and religion, grounded in an understanding of the value of the primary sources as well as the directions of current research by scholars in the field.Texts:Snorri Sturluson, Edda.

This course satisfies the first half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.The child has a privileged status in Scandinavian societies, and is widely viewed as an autonomous and capable being. Scandinavian literature about children often brings out the tension between the child’s competence and vulnerability. For example, the Swedish character Pippi Longstocking lives by herself and can lift a horse above her head, but she breaks down in tears when she is told that she isn’t polite and is reminded that she doesn’t have a family. What do we imagine the child is capable of, and from what must he or she be protected? Do adults underestimate children? What, if anything, is the difference between children and adults? This course will examine these and other questions as we problematize the categories of ‘child’ and ‘adult,’ in literature and in life.Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.© 2017 UC Regents.

Along the way, we will examine how literature represents the ways in which humans relate to trees as metaphors, symbols, resources, and historical markers. Texts to be read include parts of the Poetic and Prose Eddas, relevant folktales, poetry by a variety of Scandinavian poets including Hans Børli, Tomas Tranströmer and Inger Christensen, Kerstin Ekman’s crime novel Blackwater, and Erlend Loe’s satire Doppler, as well as presentations of artists and writers whose work considers the relationship between forests, paper, and text. This course will provide students ample room to explore the topic from a variety of angles, and they should be able to find a wide variety of materials to support their research. In addition, the topic provides opportunities for exercises outside the classroom that take advantage of the variety of plant life on the Berkeley campus.Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.© 2017 UC Regents.

This course satisfies the first half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.Migration and travel have fundamentally shaped human history from its very beginnings. Whether forced or voluntary, human mobility across the globe has led to some definitive, transformative ruptures in history, from the Indo-Aryan migration from the Indus Valley, the expansion of the Mongols, invasions of the Roman Empire, the displacement of Africans in the Atlantic slave trade, and the recent forced relocation of thousands of Syrian refugees. The age of the Vikings, perhaps the most popularized moment of migration from Scandinavia, shares this long history of human mobility and cross-cultural exchanges.This course will introduce students to the ways in which scholars ask questions, read and evaluate sources, and construct arguments. Acquiring training in textual analysis and argumentative writing, students will study the movement of people during the Viking Age, from trading and pilgrimage, to raiding and settlement. The course will explore a range of interdisciplinary approaches to history, including historical and literary sources, archaeological evidence, and scientific techniques, and will demonstrate how such evidence can be applied in academic papers. Through discussion of the motivations for travel and migration, our aim is to develop persuasive writing and to think critically about historical studies and their practical applications in our world today.Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.© 2017 UC Regents.

L&S Breadth:  Philosophy & Values OR Arts & LiteratureEffective Thursday, July 13: This course now meets in 6415 Dwinelle Hall, Scandinavia Department seminar room.This course provides an overview and discussion of the major gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines, narratives and adventures which make up the lore collectively referred to as Scandinavian, or Norse, myth. This lore is chiefly preserved in two collections traditionally called the Poetic (or Elder) Edda and the Prose (or Younger) Edda, together with some mythical sagas. The course considers not only the myths themselves, but how we know what we know about the myths of medieval Scandinavia and nearby lands, and what we can learn about the culture of pre-Christian Scandinavia from the myths their Christian descendants left us. This course will also take a summary look at what we know about cognate traditions elsewhere in Northern Europe, especially England and Germany. Students will finish the course with a comprehensive knowledge of pre-Christian Scandinavia’s mythology and religion, grounded in an understanding of the value of the primary sources as well as the directions of current research by scholars in the field.Texts:Snorri Sturluson, Edda.

This course is cross-listed with Slavic 256 and Folklore C262B/Anthropology C262B.The European lands – especially the Nordic countries, Russia and the Balkan countries – are particularly rich in folklore materials, and scholars working on these materials have made major theoretical contributions to the general discipline of folklore. This course, intended both for students of general folklore and for students of Slavic or Scandinavian literatures, will survey these contributions both in terms of the folklore materials themselves and the theoretical advances made on the basis of these materials. Readings on theory will be in the Scandinavian languages, Russian, English and German. The folklore materials themselves are in the original languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Serbian, Bosnian); English translations are available of most of these materials. Students in Scandinavian and Slavic should be reading in the original to the extent possible; students of general folklore will do readings in English (and occasionally in German). Reading consists of selections from:Propp, Vladimir. The Russian Folktale (tr. Sibelan Forrester)Propp, Vladimir. Theory and History of Folklore (ed. Anatoly Liberman)Maranda, Pierre, ed. Soviet Structural FolkloristicsLord, Albert. The Singer of TalesVidan, Aida. Embroidered with Gold, Strung with Pearls, The Traditional Ballads of Bosnian WomenAarne, Antti.

This course satisfies the first half or the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. Children all over the world have grown up with Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytales, such as “The Little Mermaid,” “The Ugly Duckling,” and “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” as they have been translated from Danish into over 125 languages. Although Andersen originally subtitled his fairytale collections “Told for Children,” he was equally interested in reaching an adult audience. The fairytales therefore address the burgeoning modernity of Andersen’s Denmark, and the issues that arose with it, many of which are still relevant today: e.g., the consequences of technology; the role of women and girls in society; the risks of conformist thinking; and the unique psychology of children. Unlike the Brothers Grimm, who collected folktales passed down through the oral tradition, Andersen based the vast majority of his fairytales on literary sources, or invented them with his own imagination; fairytales of this sort are known as Kunstmärchen (“art-fairytales”). In order to contrast Andersen with the folkloric tradition, this course will begin with readings in translation of the German folklore of the Grimms and the Norwegian folktales collected by Asbjørnsen and Moe. We will then read Andersen’s fairytales in translation and observe how the Kunstmärchen genre gave Andersen the freedom to respond to the challenges of a modernizing and evolving Europe. Along the way, we will supplement our reading of the fairytales with scholarly articles, and broaden our discussion by examining modern adaptations of Andersen’s work, such as Disney’s Frozen.Texts: Hans Christian Andersen: The Complete Fairy Tales and Stories ISBN: 978-0385189514Course readerPrerequisite:  Successful completion of the UC Entry Level Writing Requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.© 2017 UC Regents.

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the forms and mechanics of academic writing. As a guiding theme, we will read, analyze, and respond to short stories and novels that toy with our desire to understand characters’ true motivations—these are known as Machiavellian narratives, named after the Italian political theorist notorious for advocating trickery, subterfuge, and fear-mongering as effective methods of rule.The power of Machiavellian narratives will be explored through Scandinavian texts, including Victoria Benedictsson’s “From the Darkness,” St. St. Blicher’s “Tardy Awakening,” Knut Hamsun’s Hunger, Hjalmar Söderberg’s Doctor Glas, and Pär Lagerkvist’s The Dwarf. While we may not be accustomed to thinking too much about a story’s narrator as a character, Machiavellian narratives raise the question of how much we can trust a story’s narrator. How do we know what the narrator tells us is true? Does the narrator have an interest in telling us certain things but not others about the characters in the novel? What does the narrator think of the reader listening to his or her tale? By raising these questions, students will become more adept at identifying manipulative narratorial moves, discerning and analyzing the power constellations governing fiction, and, most importantly, developing the analytical skills necessary to becoming successful academic writers.Texts:  Hamsun, Knut.

L&S Breadth:  Arts & LiteratureThe Scandinavian countries are known for their distinctive nature, from the geysers and glaciers of Iceland to the fjords of Norway to the vast forests of Sweden and Finland. While natural features may seem to provide static background for culture, understandings of nature have in fact shifted over time in accordance with human concerns. Literature plays a significant role in carrying out these shifts. In recent years, literature has also stopped to ask how we arrived at our present moment, when human impact on the planet seems to be remaking the notions of nature on which human life and thought are based. In this case, literature performs a critique of the past and speculates about possible futures.This course examines the representation of nature and the environment in the Scandinavian context from the creation narratives of Norse myth through the project of 19th century nation-building and up to present concerns about climate change and environmental destruction. Students will encounter central works that have produced and contested notions of nature. Alongside these, they will read significant theoretical texts from the field of ecocriticism. This will provide an entryway into the environmental humanities, while also providing an opportunity to explore what makes Scandinavian literature and culture unique.Texts:  to be announced.Prerequisites:  None.  The course and readings are in English.© 2017 UC Regents.

All Reading & Composition courses must be taken for a letter grade in order to fulfill this requirement for the Bachelor’s Degree. This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. While the motif of the double is not exclusive to Scandinavia, its presence has been felt in Nordic Gothic literature since the early 19th century, inspired by literary translations from Britain and continental Europe. This course will trace the evolution of the Gothic and uncanny double from the late 19th century to today, looking at both time and culture as factors in its development. We will begin by getting a feel for the classic double in Western texts by way of landmark works such as Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The course will then move to Nordic literature and its own interpretation of the Gothic to explore the changes undergone by the double in the Scandinavian environment through works by Henrik Ibsen, Selma Lagerlöf, Karen Blixen and more. At its core, this course will explore how the motif of the double can be employed to better understand social anxieties and issues in the Nordic countries and beyond up to the modern day.The aim of this course is to help students further their skills in reading, analysis and composition, and to feel more confident participating in existing academic debates. The semester will culminate in a research project designed for students to learn how to find, analyze and engage with secondary sources at the university level.Texts: Thomas Tryon, The Other (NYRB Classics, ISBN: 978-1590175835)Course ReaderPrerequisite: Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading & Composition requirement or its equivalent.

In this course, we will read works by the famous Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen (1805-75), focusing primarily on his exciting experiments with the genre of the literary fairytale. He is best known for fairytales such as “The Little Mermaid,” “The Ugly Duckling,” and “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Although fairytales are often seen as children’s literature, Andersen’s fairytales contain themes appropriate for adults as well. Accordingly, his fairytales can be read in multifaceted ways that help uncover key psychological, social, and sexual themes at play.To better understand Andersen in his historical and cultural context, we will also read excerpts from some of his other works, including poems, short stories, novels, plays, travel descriptions, autobiographies, and diaries. Additionally, we will view film adaptations and look at illustrated versions of his fairytales while discussing his works in the context of both Scandinavian perceptions of childhood and the evolving market for children’s literature. Seeing Andersen from such a holistic perspective reveals the underlying tensions at work in his writing and casts him as an innovative and daring writer.Texts:Hans Christian Andersen’s Complete Fairy Tales and Stories.

What happens when things play a part in literature? Bottles, walking sticks, umbrellas, amulets, jewelry, furniture, and so on, often carry significance far beyond the apparent value and function they are assigned. Things can speak volumes about genre, plot, personification, tropes and so forth. They can articulate nostalgia for the authentic real or they can become uncanny if we are in doubt as to their status or ontology. They can be made to speak manifestly like anthropomorphic beings or implicitly and metaphorically. When things ‘come alive’ in literature they can reflect on the nature of writing (pen, ink, book) or they can serve as mnemonics within a fictional text. Things can form poetic lists, suggest social or psychological value when given as gifts, point to a culture of commodification, or serve as exotic souvenirs. In short, things take on a host of inflections, not least in shaping an ecology of sorts in the relationship between humans and things. The interest in materiality and material culture in literary studies in recent years has produced a subfield, aptly named “Thing Theory” (Bill Brown). This seminar will examine thing theory by way of analytical examples culled from a variety of genres from Icelandic sagas to Danish fairytales to Norwegian novels to Swedish poems (the list of primary texts will be selected in concert with seminar participants’ interests), often in conversation with selected excerpts from major international writers like Dickens, Kleist, Rilke, Kafka, and Borges. Critical thinkers will include Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes; and we will consult recent works on thing theory such as Bill Brown (“Thing Theory”, A Sense of Things), W.J.T. Mitchell (“Romanticism and the Life of Things”), Elaine Freedgoodd (The Ideas in Things.), Peter Schwenger (The Tears of Things), Miguel Tamen (Friends of Interpretable Objects), Barbara Johnson (Persons and Things), Jonathan Lamb (The Things Things Say), Mark Blackwell (The Secret Life of Things), Susan Stewart (On Longing), Jane Bennett (Vibrant Matter).Themes include: Gift (exchange, value), Memory (nostalgia, trauma), Reification (objectification, anthropomorphism, personification); Counterfeit (fake value, ethics), Ecology (nature, man). Prerequisites:  Graduate standing; consent of instructor.© 2017 UC Regents.

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.  The Vikings are remembered today for their raids—but they also made a name for themselves through their voyages to the edges of the medieval world. Touching down on four continents, they pushed the borders of the map in their endeavors as raiders, merchants, mercenaries and explorers. This course will follow the Norsemen on some of these journeys, beginning with local voyages in and around Scandinavia and expanding to their most far-flung destinations in the East. From the Russian steppes to the Caspian Sea, through the Byzantine Empire and beyond, we will look to literary as well as archaeological evidence to explore the impact of the Norsemen on their foreign surroundings, and vice versa. Why did they travel? What did they learn in these foreign societies? And what did they bring home with them?The aim of this course is to help students further their skills in reading, analysis and composition, and to feel more confident participating in existing academic debates.

Graduate students in this program are expected to work comparatively across the Nordic region using one specific language and literature field as a foundation. The program is especially designed to accommodate interdisciplinary work in all fields and periods.The Department of Scandinavian does not admit students who have the M.A. as a final career goal; admission is granted to the combined M.A./Ph.D. program. Students with M.A. degrees in Scandinavian from other comparable institutions, however, will apply directly to the Ph.D. program at UCB and petition to proceed without repeating the M.A. For more information on professional development, research, and teaching, visit the Graduate Division’s Professional Development Guide and calendar.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe purpose of the M.A. phase of Berkeley’s Scandinavian graduate program is to provide students with a fundamental knowledge of Scandinavian literary culture over the course of its history, including a substantial introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Scandinavian.Coursework
The minimum enrollment requirement for full-time graduate students at Berkeley is 12 units per semester—which is usually three regular (4-unit, 200 series) graduate seminars. In some cases, students may undertake undergraduate coursework in areas of special need or interest, after consultation with the Graduate Adviser.The M.A. degree requires a minimum of 24 semester units (two full-time semesters) of combined upper-division and graduate courses taken for a letter grade. The department expects the completion of one or two graded research seminar papers per semester, including the department’s course in literary theory, though exceptions are made during exam semesters.For the Scandinavian M.A., the minimum SIX letter-graded department seminars (24 units)
must include Scandinavian 210, the seminar in literary theory (taught every other year); may include two seminars in Old Norse (required for the Ph.D. and often taken in the first two years); and may include two seminars in modern Scandinavian literature (required for the Ph.D. and often taken in the first two years). The specific courses required for each student will be determined by the Graduate Adviser in consultation with the departmental faculty at the time of enrollment and are based on an evaluation of the student’s prior training in the field of Scandinavian.The Exam
Students begin preparing a reading list file during the first semester of enrollment in the program, using texts covered in seminars whenever appropriate. The file comprises two sub-lists, covering major and minor fields. Each student’s final major-field list provides broad coverage of periods, genres and authorship within a single-language literary culture. The department has designed template reading lists for M.A. major fields in Old Norse, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish which are included in the program handbook. The minor list is comparative or interdisciplinary, and designed around a special topic of the student’s choice in consultation with the relevant supervising faculty member.The M.A. exam consists of three written 8-hour take-home exams given within a one-week period; two questions cover the major field and one the minor field. An oral exam of approximately 1 ½ to 2 hours with the examining committee (comprised of three members of the department faculty) follows. Exams are judged on the ability to show comprehensive historical knowledge of literary periods, genres, central authorships as well as ability to connect and conceptualize ideas across historical periods and genre boundaries.The full description of the M.A. program degree requirements, including explicit policies and procedures are detailed in the Graduate Program Handbook.To enroll in the Ph.D. program in Scandinavian, a Master’s degree in Scandinavian or equivalent preparation is prerequisite. The Ph.D. program expects students to broaden and sharpen previous training, presumes a broad knowledge of Scandinavian literature and culture from the Viking Age through the 20th centuries, and inculcates advanced training in the interdisciplinary field of Scandinavian. The program involves three stages:The degree is awarded in recognition of a candidate’s comprehensive mastery of a broad field of learning, and for distinguished accomplishment in that field through an original contribution of significant knowledge—the dissertation.Coursework
The department’s required coursework normally takes 1.5 to 2 years of full-time (12 units per semester) enrollment. Specific departmental requirements for the Ph.D. include:When beginning the Ph.D. program, the student will meet with the Graduate Adviser to discuss appropriate coursework and requirements based on previous academic training. All Ph.D. students are required to continue coursework beyond the M.A., but the exact number of units depends upon the nature of the student’s experience. Students develop expertise in three equally weighted fields and prepare for the Qualifying Examination in their areas of specialization. Students who have completed the M.A. in Scandinavian at Berkeley, and have been granted permission to proceed, are required to finish the following requirements if they have not already done so:Additional Ph.D. coursework may include up to two seminars offered in another department. Exceptions may be approved in some cases (e.g. in conjunction with a Designated Emphasis) by the Graduate Adviser. The balance of coursework includes elective courses taken inside the Department chosen in consultation with the Graduate Adviser and major research professor. Students are particularly urged to take courses in theory and method both inside and outside the department.Students who come with an M.A. in Scandinavian from another program usually complete additional semesters of supplementary coursework in order to broaden their training in Scandinavian literary cultures and correlate with our Master program. The exact courses and number of units are determined by the Graduate Adviser in consultation with other department faculty at the time of enrollment, and depends on previous preparation in the field of Scandinavian. (Examples include the Scandinavian seminar in literary theory, Graduate Division language requirements, etc.)Field papers
Two faculty-approved field papers are required by the end of the third week of the semester in which the written Ph.D. qualifying exam takes place. This is typically a research paper revised beyond the level of seminar work which represents the student’s best effort and reflects the standards of the discipline.The Qualifying Examination
The purpose of the Qualifying Exam is to test the student’s mastery over broad areas of knowledge. The exam offers the student an opportunity to synthesize factual information and training in techniques absorbed through instruction and individual research, and to demonstrate readiness to enter the dissertation phase of graduate study by showing evidence of independent critical thought and writing.During the coursework phase, students compile three reading lists for the Qualifying Exam. The lists are designed using these categories:The specific content of the three fields is defined in conjunction with the examining committee and the Graduate Adviser. Lists may repeat items from the major and minor UCB Scandinavian M.A. exam lists, but an item may not be listed on more than one Ph.D. list. The examination is partly based on the reading lists (which represent a minimum of preparation), but also on expected familiarity with other important or representative works.The four-member examining committee is appointed in consultation with the student and Graduate Adviser, and must include a UCB Senate faculty member from outside the department (this can also be the representative for an official Designated Emphasis). Final approval of the committee is made by the Graduate Division when the student requests permission to take the exam.Written take-home exams take place over three days—by email—in which the student has 12 hours to prepare, write, and return each of three examination essays. These are completed within a two-week period. Students must pass the written portions of the exam before proceeding to the oral examination. The oral exam takes place within fifteen days of successful completion of the written components and lasts between two and three hours.The Dissertation
A dissertation is expected to make an original and substantial contribution to the student’s particular field knowledge and specialization. It is a work of connected expository prose presenting the discovery of new information; the combination or synthesis of previously unconnected facts; production of new interpretations of cultural material; application of theory to literary, linguistic, artistic, cultural or historical phenomena; extension of methodology characteristic of a particular discipline into the subject area of some other discipline or disciplines; or some combination of any or all of the above.The full description of the Ph.D. program degree requirements, including explicit policies and procedures are detailed in the Graduate Program Handbook.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe best prepared applicants to the M.A./Ph.D. program in Scandinavian will have a strong knowledge of one Scandinavian language, a good reading ability in at least one other Scandinavian language, excellent writing skills, and knowledge of the broad outline of Scandinavian literary, cultural, and intellectual history. Students with deficiencies in any of these areas may also be considered, especially if they have clearly taken measures to address gaps in the profile. The department is also ready to entertain program proposals from applicants with special interests in areas such as art and history as long as the primary interests are literary. Completion of an official undergraduate major in Scandinavian Studies is not required for admission to the graduate program as long as the functional language and research skills necessary for graduate-seminar work are in place at the start of graduate studies.When preparing to apply, students should articulate a research statement of interest that makes clear the intersection of the student’s interests with those of the department faculty, the student’s motivation for graduate study, and a possible field of research emphasis.The average time to Ph.D. degree completion for students entering the Scandinavian graduate program is six-seven years, including all phases of M.A. and Ph.D. coursework, exams, and dissertation research and writing. Time in the program will be shorter for those entering with an equivalent M.A. degree in Scandinavian or a closely related field.International applicants: It is important for students applying from abroad to realize that Berkeley is a public university and that student support funding structures limit the number of international applicants that can be considered for admission. Nevertheless, international applicants with very strong academic records and research interests appropriate to our program are encouraged to apply if they are willing to pursue the broad comparative training in Scandinavian topics that our program provides. Of special note: Students accepted from abroad cannot enter the program to work directly on dissertation research, but must first complete the required coursework and Qualifying Exam before being advanced to Ph.D. candidacy.Instructions for applying:The admissions process for the Department of Scandinavian graduate program runs on an annual basis, with each year’s online applications generally becoming available in early September and a submissions deadline in early January. Applications cannot be considered off-cycle. We do not accept applications for an M.A.-only degree program.

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Graduate Student Handbook for the Department of Scandinavian is the consolidated reference resource for continuing graduate students in the department. It contains the most detailed and recent statement of official departmental and divisional policies relevant to progress through the M.A. and Ph.D. programs, and students are encouraged to consult it regularly. For the most recent version of the handbook, click here.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedMedieval StudiesThe interdisciplinary graduate group in Medieval Studies provides intellectual interaction between faculty and graduate students in a variety of UCB departments that feature medieval studies within their individual curricula. Graduate students already accepted and enrolled in a home department can also apply to the Medieval Studies Concurrent Ph.D. program. More detailed information on the interdisciplinary program in Medieval Studies can be found here.Designated Emphasis programsThe UCB Graduate Division allows students accepted and enrolled in a home department to pursue a Designated Emphasis (essentially, a graduate minor) in an approved interdisciplinary field. Each Designated Emphasis has its own requirements, but usually requires several core courses and representation from the relevant faculty on both the exam and dissertation committees. The Designated Emphasis programs listed below are those that have typically been of interest to our students; please consult each website for detailed descriptions and requirements. (It is assumed that students who are considering one of these options will have discussed their plans with the department’s current Graduate Adviser early enough in their graduate careers so as not to unduly delay their time to degree.)The Designated Emphasis in Critical Theory: The DE in Critical Theory permits interested students to specialize in critical theory, and to obtain certification of this specialization, while pursuing a Ph.D. in an established UC Berkeley Department. Critical Theory is not an independent degree granting program. Students admitted to the DE and completing the requirements will receive a parenthetical notation to that effect on their doctoral degrees.Designated Emphasis in Film Studies: The Designated Emphasis in Film Studies provides curricular and research resources for students who want to concentrate on film within their respective disciplines and have their work formally recognized. Applicants to this program must have completed one seminar in the Department of Film and Media at the time of application and must fulfill specific course, Qualifying Exam, and Dissertation Committee requirements if admitted to the program.Designated Emphasis in Folklore: Students receiving degrees from other departments may now declare a designated emphasis in Folklore Studies. The designated emphasis is designed to complement core PhD programs and provides exciting opportunities for interdisciplinary study and cross-collaboration.The Designated Emphasis in Renaissance and Early Modern Studies: offers comprehensive training in intellectual and cultural history, material culture, and languages of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods.The Designated Emphasis Program in Women, Gender, and Sexuality: This is an interdisciplinary program available to students who are already admitted to a graduate program at University of California, Berkeley. Taken in conjunction with Ph.D. programs in the Humanities and Social Sciences, the Designated Emphasis provides opportunities for interdisciplinary study with more than 30 faculty across the campus.The Designated Emphasis in New Media:  BCNM’s Designated Emphasis (D.E.) program is for selected UC Berkeley Ph.D. students from any Berkeley home department with research interests in new media. It is supplemental to the Ph.D. program in the regular departments, and provides enhanced skills in analyzing and/or designing future media with an awareness of historical, social, cultural, and other perspectives that might not be visible from any single disciplinary point of view.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe department limits the number of graduate students admitted to those it can support with multiple-year financial packages that combine university fellowships, department grants, and employment as a Graduate Student Instructor. Some of these funding sources are awarded at the time of admission, and others are reserved for the dissertation phase of the program. In addition to the main sources of annual support guaranteed in advance at the time of admission, smaller grants targeted to specific travel needs for research or conference presentations are awarded on an annual basis.Department Fellowships
The department sometimes supports incoming students with available internal funding at a level comparable to an annual GSI salary.Departmental Librarian Position
Students can also be assigned a position as Department Librarian, which provides the equivalent of an annual GSI salary.Graduate Student Instructor PositionsLanguage Teaching:
The department can appoint students with the necessary language fluency in a modern Scandinavian language to an instructor position teaching both beginning and intermediate classes. Training in language pedagogy is required and provided by the department.Reading and Composition Teaching:
Students are also given opportunities to teach courses in the university’s Reading and Composition sequence by choosing topics of their own interest together with Scandinavian texts taught in translation. Additional campus training in college-writing pedagogy is also required in conjunction with these assignments.
R&C assignments for experienced instructors are also available each summer in the UCB Summer Sessions as a way to earn extra income in addition to the annual student support packages.The qualifications for appointment to a Graduate Student Instructor position can be found here.Graduate Student Researcher positions
Individual department faculty members at times have research funding available to hire graduate students to aid with their ongoing research projects. These appointments can under certain conditions be combined with other positions.Readerships
Faculty undergraduate courses with high enrollments can qualify for funds to hire course Readers to assist faculty instructors with the grading of papers and assignments. Paid duties include hours spent in attendance, reading, or grading, but Readers do not supervise discussion sections or hold office hours.Research and Professional Travel Funding
The department has some limited funds available to support student travel and participation in language programs, conferences (including teacher workshops), and individual research projects. Partial funding of travel to the annual SASS conference is guaranteed for those presenting papers, and requests for that funding should be folded into the annual continuing student funding application (see below), but for other travel opportunities related to professional development, students can apply off-cycle using this form.Application Procedures:For continuing graduate students in the Department of Scandinavian:
There is an annual application cycle for continued funding in which each student is required to complete an updated application each February. The most recent version of the application form can be found here, and the general instructions for filling out the form here.For students enrolled in other UCB graduate programs:
Graduate Student Instructor assignments made for the regular academic year are generally reserved for Department of Scandinavian graduate students since they serve as a form of departmental financial support. Even so, there are occasionally teaching opportunities available during the year and especially in Summer Sessions for those students outside the department with the required teacher training and experience with Scandinavian literary or filmic materials. Interested students should apply to the current faculty Graduate Adviser with a CV and statement of interest.University Fellowships upon admission
Incoming students with superior academic records may be nominated during the admissions process to a university-wide selection committee for consideration for multi-year fellowships. If awarded, these fellowships may form part of an admitted student’s overall multi-year support package; otherwise, a combination of departmental funding and teaching appointments will form the basis for a student’s financial support package.Graduate Division Conference Travel Grants
Ph.D. and Master’s students in academic degree programs may apply for funding to attend professional conferences. Grant amounts will depend on the location of the conference (up to $400 within California, $600 elsewhere in North America, including Canada or Mexico, and $1,000 outside of North America. Master’s students are eligible for only one conference travel grant per academic career. Doctoral students are eligible for two grants per graduate career, regardless of how many degrees they earn. To be eligible to apply, applicants must be registered for the term in which they are planning to attend the conference (students on filing fee are not eligible); be in good academic standing; and be presenting a paper or poster at the conference. The application for these travel grants can be found here.Fritz O. Fernström Fellowship
The Department of Scandinavian administers the Fritz O. Fernström Fellowship program on behalf of the university. The terms of the endowment state “preference shall be given to American students who wish to study in Scandinavia, preferably Sweden, and to students in Scandinavian Languages and Literature,” but the evaluation committee uses a wide definition of Scandinavia and encourages applications from current qualified graduate students in all fields at UC-Berkeley. The fellowship as now administered is thus intended to support short-term or year-long research or study that requires travel to any of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden). Past awards have been made to students from Architecture, Rhetoric, Music, Political Science, Art, Sociology, Energy & Resources, and Computer Science, as well as to students from the Department of Scandinavian. Students must be U.S. citizens or Permanent Residents, and must be currently registered graduate students at UCB. Applications are evaluated in an annual competition with an application deadline that usually falls in mid-February. Selection criteria include the overall strength of the academic record and faculty recommendations, the degree of preparation (including language competency, when relevant to the project), the expected intellectual contribution of the project to research in the applicant’s field, and the feasibility of the plan given the described methodology and resources. Successful applications demonstrate the need for research or study in a Scandinavian country that cannot be accomplished elsewhere, or relevance of the language and/or culture to the student’s dissertation topic. Demonstrated effort at finding support from multiple sources also counts in an applicant’s favor. Award amounts have averaged approximately $3750 over the past 10 years, including both short and longer-term stays abroad (students looking for year-long support may also combine Fernström funding with other sources). Applications to support advanced language study or conference attendance may also be considered when that study is crucial to a specific research plan. Requested budgets may be adjusted in the final awards. Current deadlines and the most recent application form can be found here.Doctoral Completion Fellowship
Beginning with the students who began graduate study in Fall 2010, all those who have officially advanced to PhD candidacy (having passed their Qualifying Exams) are offered a two-semester stipend of $18,000 plus fees (and non-resident tuition for international students) as incentive for completing the dissertation within the normative time (defined for the Scandinavian as seven years total in the program). Students who receive this fellowship agree that they will not be eligible to receive any form of University funding (including teaching assignments, department block grant, and travel and research support) after the completion of their seventh year of study.UC Dissertation-Year Fellowships
The UC Office of the President sponsors this dissertation-year fellowship program for Berkeley students. Awards currently include a living stipend of $20,500, payment of fees, and a travel allowance. Eligibility criteria for this dissertation include: experience of situations or conditions which were an impediment to advancing to graduate study; the pursuit of academic research interests focusing on cultural, societal or educational problems as they affect educationally disadvantaged segments of society; or evidence of intention to use the doctoral degree toward serving educationally underrepresented segments of society. A more detailed description of the program and a recent application can be found here.Townsend Dissertation Fellowships
This fellowship is intended to further the research of Ph.D candidates through interdisciplinary discussion with student and faculty colleagues in other disciplines and departments. Awards are based on the scholarly merit of the individual applications. Projects need not be “interdisciplinary” by definition, but are evaluated in part by their potential interest for interdisciplinary discussion. Townsend Graduate Student Fellows receive an $18,000 stipend, and the Townsend Center will also provide payment of fees depending on the availability of funds. Effective September 1, 2011, Townsend Dissertation Fellows may combine fellowship awards up to the maximum amount set by the Graduate Division, but since the purpose of the Townsend Fellowship is to enable full-time research, Townsend Fellows are not eligible to teach or hold other academic appointments during the fellowship year. More information about the award can be found here.Maternity/Paternity support and accommodation
The Graduate Division administers a need-based grant for graduate students (single, married, or registered domestic partners) living with dependent children. Grants may be applied toward housing/living expenses, dependent health insurance, child care, and/or tuition. If funding permits, awards of up to $8,000 per year ($4,000 per academic term) will be made to eligible applicants. An example of a recent application form can be found here.For an updated list of other university sources of graduate financial support and the most current application deadlines and forms, consult the Graduate Division Fellowships and Grants website.The following are suggested funding sources outside the university that are of particular interest to graduate students studying in the Department of Scandinavian. Most of them express a preference for dissertation-stage students in their selection criteria, but please consult each website for more detailed information.American-Scandinavian Foundation FellowshipsThe American-Scandinavian Foundation administers an annual fellowship competition in all academic and artistic fields for American scholars to pursue study, research, or artistic projects in any of the five Nordic countries.Fulbright U.S. Student ProgramThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program provides grants for individually designed study/research projects or for English Teaching Assistant Programs. A candidate will submit a Statement of Grant Purpose defining activities to take place during one academic year in a participating country outside the U.S.Birgit Baldwin Fellowship in Scandinavian Studies
The Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study (SASS) is responsible for an annual fellowship competition for dissertation students in the fields of Scandinavian (Nordic) literature or film that can most effectively be pursued in the archives and libraries of the Nordic countries.The Einar and Eva Lund Haugen Memorial ScholarshipThe scholarship is intended to support outstanding graduate students whose doctoral dissertation examines a Scandinavian or Scandinavian-American topic in the Social Sciences or History, broadly defined. SASS administers this scholarship competition.SWEAThe Swedish Women’s Educational Association (SWEA) is a worldwide organization that offers two doctoral research scholarships of $10,000 through the SWEA Litteraturstipendiet program. Applicants should be an accomplished doctoral student at a university outside Sweden pursuing research in Swedish language, literature, or society.The local San Francisco chapter of SWEA also runs its own fellowship competition for an award in the amount of $7500. It is intended to be awarded to a qualified individual or group in the Western United States who is pursuing academic or professional research or artistic endeavors with particular relevance to Sweden. The candidate’s project may include, but is not limited to, work in areas such as Swedish culture, history, music, visual or performing arts, literature, media, sciences, or the environment. It is expected that the project will result in a tangible product and will be completed within a year of receipt of the award. The final outcome of the project should be of a kind that can be shared with other interested groups or parties to help spread knowledge about Sweden abroad.Leifur Eiríksson Foundation ScholarshipThese scholarships are intended for students at U.S. universities to pursue graduate study or research at Icelandic universities.© 2017 UC Regents.

The Gudrun Gytel Fund was established in 1998 in order to provide qualified American University students with the opportunity to further their knowledge of Danish culture, history, language, literature, politics and society. The scholarship supports semester or academic year-long study at recognized Danish institutions of higher education in the fields of humanities and social sciences, as well as in architecture, engineering, technology and related fields.Undergraduate Travel GrantsJames I. Healy Undergraduate Travel Fund
The Healy travel fund was established in 2007 through a generous donation from James Healy, who received a B.A. in Scandinavian in 1990. The amount of the award is flexible, and can be used to support travel by currently enrolled UC-Berkeley undergraduates to Scandinavian countries in order to further their study of Scandinavian languages and cultures, with a preference for Danish. Preference will be given to students returning to campus after studying abroad to complete their final semester at Berkeley, but students completing major requirements abroad will also be considered with prior faculty advisor permission. Interested students should submit an unofficial transcript and a 1-2 page, single-spaced statement of purpose to the current Undergraduate Faculty Adviser by February 1, with awards targeted for use the following summer or academic year. The statement should note the departmental courses taken so far, the relevant details of the study-abroad program, and the importance of the targeted program for the intended course of study. NOTE: Undergraduate awards may or may not affect University financial aid status. Documentation of travel and study in a Scandinavian country, as well as a summary report of the experience, will be required for all awardees.Past recipients of the Healy Travel Grant include:Douglas Blue (2011, Danish/Scandinavian Minor)
Genevieve Thurston (2009, Danish/Scandinavian Major)Lundberg Travel Grant
Beginning in the academic year 2015-16, the Department of Scandinavian encourages students who have taken coursework in the department to apply for grants to subsidize travel to study-abroad programs anywhere in the Nordic region, either for summer or semester-long programs. One Lundberg Travel Grant in the amount of $1500 will be available each year in this competition. The deadline is February 1 each year (applications cannot be considered off-cycle), and applicants should not have more than junior-year standing at that time (awards are targeted for use the following summer or academic year). Interested students should submit an unofficial transcript and a 1-2 page, single-spaced statement of purpose to the current Undergraduate Faculty Adviser by that deadline, together with this application form. The statement should note the departmental courses taken so far, the relevant details of the study-abroad program, and the importance of the targeted program for the intended course of study. Preference will be given to Scandinavian majors, but all who have taken a minimum of two courses in the department (including enrollments current at the time of application) are eligible for the competition. NOTE: Undergraduate awards may or may not affect University financial aid status. Documentation of travel and study in a Scandinavian country will be required for all awardees.© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedDid you know?Freshmen entering with Advanced Placement enrichment courses taken in high school are in a perfect position to pursue a double major while attending UC Berkeley. These credited units used to satisfy University requirements do not have to be counted towards the 120-130 unit maximum for the Bachelor’s Degree, allowing students to remain at Berkeley for a full eight semesters while acquiring two majors.An early start to language study during one’s freshman or sophomore year is key to allowing sufficient time to acquire the four semesters of language courses required for each of the five concentrations within the Scandinavian major. Elementary language sequences in Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish begin each fall and can be applied to the chosen major concentration in the language and culture of one Nordic country. A concentration in Old Norse Studies has more flexibility in the second year of language study, including options for using first-year instruction of Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish or two semesters of elementary Icelandic or two semesters of elementary Latin (Latin 1 and 2) when combined with a year of coursework in beginning Old Norse.In general, up to two courses can be double-counted towards requirements in two different major programs at Berkeley depending how closely related the major requirements are. Essentially, two courses can count as four, making it easier to double major. In addition, there are several majors at UC Berkeley (such as Political Economy or Peace and Conflict Studies) that require four semesters of lower-division language, which may also be applied (with permission of the other major program) to lower-division language requirements within the Scandinavian major. With four courses overlapping between two majors, the double major becomes a clear possibility. Students in Classics, Medieval Studies, or other major programs that emphasize the study of Latin will also find it easier to fit in a double major in Old Norse Studies by utilizing Latin 1 and 2 coursework for this concentration.Why Two Majors?Berkeley is a unique learning environment with a diversity of majors, curricula, research, and study-abroad opportunities. Students double-majoring in Scandinavian also study in fields as far-ranging as the environmental sciences, biological sciences, history of art, mathematics, business, history, comparative literature, and architecture, among many others. Many of our double majors pursue a balance between fulfilling career goals and feeding their intellectual and personal interests in the study of the language and culture of the Nordic world, a region that has brought significant contributions in areas such as environmental studies, international studies, peace and diplomacy, public policy, political science, architecture, design, economics, medieval literature, folklore, history, drama, film and linguistics.Have we given you something to think about?Early planning is the key.

Undergraduate Student Services Advisor© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Undergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI) is a campuswide project that has been under development at Berkeley since Fall 2007. This initiative is designed to promote and facilitate learning for undergraduates across campus. As part of this initiative, the Scandinavian Department faculty has articulated learning goals in the Scandinavian major and minor and suggested pathways to reach those goals.Learning goals for the Scandinavian majorCommunicative competence in one of the modern Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish), in both the spoken and written language within a cultural context (please note special requirements for Finnish, below), or in the case of the Old Norse Studies concentration, reading competence in Old Norse;
Understanding of the linguistic, historical, and cultural relationships that join and divide the nations and peoples of the Nordic region;
Understanding the broad trajectory of Nordic literary culture from the Middle Ages to contemporary times, including both canonical works and works from the margins;
Mastery of research and analytical skills sufficient to enable the student to understand received wisdom and new scholarship, and to draw insightful and original conclusions about literature, film, folklore, art history, and other aspects of literary culture;
Writing and reasoning skills (mounting a persuasive argument, marshalling and synthesizing appropriate evidence, crafting syntactically correct, carefully documented essays and oral presentations).One of the unique aspects of Nordic literary studies is the close relationship among the countries and their languages (excepting Finnish, which is not linguistically related to the Scandinavian languages). Students majoring in our discipline, while developing competence in one of the languages, are expected to take cultural courses (taught in translation) that extend across national boundaries so that they develop knowledge of the region as a whole. There are courses that are limited to an authorship within one national literature (Andersen, Bergman, Ibsen, Strindberg, for example), but students are expected to take courses outside their area of language competence as many of our courses are pan-Scandinavian in focus.We assess the achievement of modern-language skills in written and oral examinations and writing assignments within the context of individual courses. The modern language courses require the assessment of both oral and written skills. Students are assessed orally for their mastery of specific communicative acts at a particular threshold (according to ACTFL proficiency guidelines): for example, correct use of appropriate vocabulary and verb tense, awareness of syntax, knowledge of time expressions, idioms, plural forms, etc. Written assessment centers on the same knowledge but requires students to use a more extensive vocabulary and stretch the range of their expression. Part of the writing process includes learning to use reference tools and libraries.Students in literature and culture courses write research papers as well as comprehensive written examinations. Majors in the discipline take two individual tutorials designed to strengthen language and analytical skills with faculty members. The tutorials are offered in conjunction with an upper-division literature course, but require that readings be done in the original language. Faculty members teaching these tutorials assess the level of language competency through oral communication during the tutorial, when appropriate, and through written assignments in the original language. Majors in the discipline are encouraged to complete an honors thesis as a further capstone experience.The minor in Scandinavian is designed primarily for students who wish to undertake study of Nordic culture without learning a language. Except for communicative competence, the goals for the minor are the same as those for the major. The minor program does not include the capstone tutorials or the option of an honors thesis.We observe the achievement of these goals in the post-B.A. career trajectories of our majors both in academic and a broad range of other professions that require these skills (rigorous training emphasizing language skills, research acumen, and persuasive argument): business, law, medicine, public policy and government, and the arts.Paths to Learning Goals in the Scandinavian Major and MinorFoundational courses:

Many Scandinavian majors spend a summer, semester, or academic year at a university in a Nordic country, often through the Education Abroad Program, which has centers in Lund, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark. We encourage such study as an excellent way to obtain the communicative and cultural competence that is the goal of our major.Capstone experiences:
Scandin 145 (Senior seminar)
Scandin 149 (subject-oriented original language reading and writing)

Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Department of Scandinavian welcomes transfer students and encourages them to choose one of our five new major concentrations available beginning Fall Semester 2015. Our Undergraduate Student Services Advisor is available to help you plan course work towards a single major, but also for a double major or a minor. To find out about admission to Berkeley as a transfer student click here for information.Good News for Community-College Transfer Students!You may have noticed by viewing transfer information offered by your community college that lower-division courses required for Scandinavian major concentrations are unavailable. This is due to the fact that Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, and modern Icelandic are not commonly taught languages. The good news: students do not have to take language prerequisites and Scandinavian 60 and 75 before applying for transfer to be considered for admission to UC Berkeley and the major in Scandinavian. Our language sequences begin each Fall at both the first- and second-year levels, and the required lower-division courses Scandinavian 75 (Literature and Culture of the Nordic World, offered each Fall Semester) and 60 (Heroic Legends of the North, offered each Spring Semester) can be taken upon arrival and completed within the first academic year at Berkeley. The 46 total required units—including all upper-division requirements—can be completed within the four to five semesters allotted for transfer students to finish requirements for the Bachelor’s Degree.If you are considering a major or double major, you should contact the Undergraduate Student Services Advisor as soon as possible after admission to Berkeley. The College of Letters and Science has a firm deadline for transfer students declaring a major (early in their second semester), so plan to start taking your first language course and Scandinavian 75 upon arrival in the fall. For information on requirements, click here.If you plan to minor in Scandinavian, you should also contact our Undergraduate Student Services Advisor as early as possible to explore this option. For transfer students with a limited time to complete requirements for the Bachelor’s Degree, the sooner you explore this option the sooner we will be able to determine together whether adding a minor is workable. Students interested in the minor should plan a study list with an intent to minor with the Undergraduate Student Services Advisor.

Undergraduate Student Services Advisor© 2017 UC Regents. Reproduction of images, sounds, or content without permission is prohibitedThe Department of Scandinavian offers an undergraduate major with concentrations in five areas: Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Old Norse Studies, and Swedish. Each of these concentrations allows students to explore the major while developing expertise within the language and literature of one of the Nordic languages. While the electives built into each of the five concentrations allow room to explore all phases of Scandinavian literature and cultural history from the medieval to the modern, the core courses for each will emphasize the specific language of choice. Students receive further training in their major language skills by pursuing reading in original Scandinavian languages when coursework allows, and through special add-on major units (Scandinavian 149). These units allow students the opportunity to work closely with a professor in their major language area. The Old Norse Studies concentration also allows students with strong interests in comparative medieval studies to choose elective courses offered in that field in other departments to complete their course list for the Scandinavian major.A new major structure, effective Fall 2015, includes the choice of one of five concentrations. Each concentration requires two new lower-division gateway courses:SCANDIN 60: Heroic Legends of the North (4 units) [Spring only]SCANDIN 75: Literature and Culture of the Nordic World (4 units) [Fall only]In addition, the following lower-division language and upper-division courses are required for each of the concentrations.

Appointments are available by contacting Ms. Gerdes.Students occasionally choose to go on a study-abroad program in Scandinavian countries that is not run by EAP. While this can be a productive option, the transfer of credits can be a significant issue, and students should become well informed both about the credentials of the program of interest and the procedures for counting work done toward one’s UCB degree. Details on EAP-sponsored programs, application requirements, and information on study abroad through other institutions can be found by starting with their home page.Major and Minor Advising Before Applying to a Study-Abroad ProgramDeclared or prospective majors for all concentrations in the Scandinavian major or those planning a minor should arrange an appointment with our Undergraduate Student Services Advisor well in advance of applying to any program for study abroad. Issues including language preparation prior to departure, the timely completion of major or minor requirements, preliminary review of potential courses to be taken abroad, time to degree, and others will be discussed and a workable study-list plan will be established. With careful planning, students can apply to their program of choice with confidence that requirements will be met while enjoying their experience abroad.Upon approval, up to three courses (12 units) may be applied in fulfillment of major requirements; for minors, up to two courses (8 units) may be applied toward minor requirements.For an appointment, contact Amanda Minafo, Undergraduate Student Services Advisor.For confirmation of transferable coursework credit for the major or minor upon your return, plan to make an appointment with the current Faculty Undergraduate Advisor in the Department of Scandinavian (information on the current faculty assignment is available here).Danish and Swedish Language ProficiencyPrograms emphasizing the study of Danish or Swedish language and culture require a pre-departure proficiency at a minimum of 1 year of elementary language study. Course lectures, reading, and written assignments are normally taught in the language of the country, with the exception of the summer program in Denmark. For questions regarding your proficiency level to ensure successful study abroad, please contact Karen Møller, Scandinavian Department Language Program Coordinator: kmoller@berkeley.edu© 2017 UC Regents.
