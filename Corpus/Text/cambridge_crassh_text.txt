The second event from the “Decolonising the Curriculum” seminar series has made it clear that ‘decolonising the curriculum’ is not a ubiquitous struggle but can hold a plethora of meanings ranging from cultivating understanding amongst students to ‘being toxic’ to universities and turning the establishment upside down. During the second meeting, the focus turned from the UK to perspectives on the decolonisation of education and scholarship in the context of Latin America  – a continent in which decolonising the curriculum means much more than having minority voices and multiple perspectives valued and heard; it involves re-gaining the links to the occupied space both physically and mentally, revitalising ancestral knowledge and ways of living marginalised throughout years of colonial occupation and subsequent domination of the West.Antonio Sergio Guimares, Simon Bolivar visiting Professor at the Centre of Latin American Studies at the University of Cambridge, began the discussion by introducing us to the work of Guirrermo Ramos, the first Brazilian social theorist that openly identified as black, active in the 1950s. Ramos put forward a critique of what he called consular or colonial sociology, i.e one in which ideas were applied without ‘local colour’ and posed a question, debated till the present, about the possibility of having a uniquely Brazilian sociology. The question evolves around the wider problematic around the universals and particulars of sociological thought. While there is not a straightforward solution to the issue, Ramos emphasised that the universals of sociology depend on its particulars. That the epistemology and ideas used will always depend on the problems in consideration and the kind of questions asked. Antonio Sergio reminded us that at the time of Guirrermo Ramos the questions and problems raised by sociology in Brazil were not Brazilian; modernisation was considered an inevitable process and society was analysed through a Marxist lens of transition from feudal towards a capitalist society. This situation led Ramos to stress the point, relevant as ever, that sociological research must engage with national reality and that foreign ideas should be used albeit not as a primary source of investigation but complementary to a sociology developed from the ‘bottom up’.Rosaleen Howard, Chair of Hispanic Studies and Director of Centre of Latin American Studies at  Newcastle University, spoke subsequently about the direct efforts to ‘decolonise’ education in the Andes, focusing on the case of Bolivia.  She discussed the intrinsic relationship between language access, discourse and social inclusion and participation taking us on a journey through the transformations that took place within subsequent educational reforms. Following the first introduction of bilingual and intercultural education in 1994, the indigenous could, in the words of an Aymara Education council member, finally ‘have a presence’ rather than just being ‘observers’ in the formation of their own education. While not everything in the garden was rosy with the government gradually distancing itself from the intercultural model and planning new reforms it managed to live on with reformation only taking place after Morales took office. The new educational law most differed most saliently from the previous with the inclusion of ‘intraculturality’ – recuperation, strengthening, and cohesion within cultures – and an open call for a ‘decolonisation’ of education.Rosaleen underscored the importance of including the call for decolonising education into the official political discourse citing Colombia’s indigenous educator’s Abadio Green’s assertion that if he dared to speak in his country in such ‘big’ terms he would be called a subversive.One issue, acknowledged by both Rosaleen and the audience, is the difficulty of providing equal consideration for all the 36 groups forming the Bolivian ‘plurination’ with the Chiquitano people (numbering around 180,000) incessantly unrepresented, not to mention the much smaller, mostly Amazonian, cultures or ‘nations’. Can there be decolonisation for all? Who are its explicit beneficiaries, who gets left out and with what consequences? How can decolonisation efforts be made as inclusive as possible?David Lehman, Professor of Sociology, University of Cambridge and the final from the panelists, spoke about the creation of intercultural universities in Mexico. Such universities, albeit not explicitly ‘indigenous’ were initiated by educators with aims of increasing indigenous participation in higher education both via their curricular content and locations. While ‘decolonisation’, unlike in the case of Bolivia, does not form part of their official discourse it lurks around within the universities’ rhetoric. David described their objectives as removing the autocratic, authoritarian characteristic of higher education and giving the people “their culture back”.  Although most of the teachers do not come from indigenous backgrounds nor speak the indigenous language the application of the ideas of ‘radical’ social theorists such as Leon Vygotsky or Paolo Freire has led the universities to concentrate on “giving people a voice” rather than passively transferring top-down information.The audience actively contributed to the discussion raising important questions about the legal basis, content of, and the indigenous response to propositions and occurrences of a potentially decolonising character. What does decolonisation really entail in terms of the details of curricular content and process of its implementation? Should the parties involved be held legally accountable for a lack of adherence to reforms? How can indigenous pride be promoted in environments where racism is still very much alive, as well as privileging participation over the potential alluring alternative of ‘assimilation’ in reaction to discrimination. Although there is no straightforward answer to any of these questions, possible  ‘solutions’ emerge from different places. In Bolivia, apart from language instruction, curricular reforms involve the inclusion of indigenous worldviews and visions of history as well as community involvement.  Rosaleen pointed out how in Peru there exist manuals with guidelines towards legal implementation. Moreover, with the law of prior consultation, indigenous communities affected have a say in their formation. Such guidelines can act as a legal reference when reform implementation has unintended consequences and questions of accountability are raised. David suggested that the absence of an explicit discourse of indigeneity in Mexican intercultural universities can make them more ‘attractive’ for students at a structural socio-economic disadvantage, yet without an indigenous self-identification.Overall, the discussion made it clear that Latin America emerges as a continent in which the hope of intellectual decolonisation is materialising into tangible actions and political objectives are positioning decolonisation not as a chimera, but as a realistic goal. Nevertheless, despite the efforts for a volte-face from Western privilege and colonial discourse there is still a scent of ambiguity around who will benefit from them and the precise direction these efforts will take.This blogpost was originally published on decolonisingcambridge.org and is reproduced here by kind permission.Find out more about the Decolonising the Curriculum research group, including forthcoming events, here.Contributor:

They Are Burning Memory by Njabulo S. Ndebele
More on Rhodes Must FallTo conclude the reflexive session, Walker shared the idea that perhaps, the process of decolonization is one that may be inherently violent.  The reclaiming of rights, of spaces, of one’s own voice necessitates returning power to its just owner.  This idea implies that the current holder of the above may not cede what’s rightfully ours peaceably.  If so, we should consider the place and meaning of violence in our lives. To consider the place of violence and justice in your own mind and life, the speakers encouraged Lewis Gordon’s lecture on Fanon and Violence, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7upDMigHgC4Finally, Epstein and Walker closed the workshop in laughter and community, as we came together to watch Trevor Noah satirize colonialism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjEE_J6XzcAnd, thus, may we all go forward to work on decolonising our own minds and supporting each other.  In our work towards justice, we must not forget to take care of and to challenge our own minds. Contributor:

The panel touched upon three different topics; scholarly traditions developed in India around decolonizing knowledge (Dr Subir Sinha), Pakistan’s particular case of dealing with violence and decolonization (Mahvish Ahmed), and questions about continuing ‘internal colonization’ in India (Ananya Mishra). The discussion brought to fore the challenge of conceptual and historical conflation in the region. Can all of South Asia be known to have the same ‘kind’ of experience with colonization? What is the history of the people within these contexts? Can the current state and its treatment of some groups of people be seen as a kind of colonization? Dr Subir Sinha, SOASThe panel started with Dr Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in Department of Developing Studies, SOAS. Opening the discussion, Dr Sinha deliberated on the emergence of subaltern and ‘anti-modernist’ studies in India in the 1980s as a challenge to coloniality. The subaltern studies group grew rather influential, but was not without its critics. Latin American scholar Grosfoguel argued that early subaltern studies by using European theorists often reproduced Euro-centrism even as it sought to critique it. The ‘new subaltern’ started emerging in the late 1990s, particularly in Gayatri Spivak’s (1999) work as she started writing about the impossibility of assimilating indigenous movements into Western liberal feminism. The ‘anti-modernists’, Dr Sinha said included scholars connected with environmental movements, such as Ashis Nandy and Vandana Shiva. Another field of work emerged with the works of academics S.N. Balgangadhar and Rajiv Malhotra. Dr Sinha critiqued this group of cultural nationalist scholars for appropriating notions of decolonization. For example, Prakash Shah argued that the category of caste itself was imagined by colonialists.With this overview, Dr Sinha made two appeals; one pedagogical in nature, and the other conceptual. Pedagogically he pointed that students need to be encouraged to read this scholarship, along with those of Savarkar and Godse, to get a grasp of the work that has challenged dominant colonial thought. Finally, in conclusion to finding ways of reconciling these different strands of scholarship, he pointed to a need of developing hybrid ideas. For instance, he appealed to reclaim and reimagine ideas of enlightenment usually viewed as being European, and use them in works and movements of decolonisation. This, he claimed is a strategy often used by Dalit activists and other movements across the world. Hybrid models such as the caste-class complex in the work of Dalit Marxist scholars have been particularly useful.
Mahvish Ahmad, CambridgeMahvish Ahmad brought the view from Pakistan to the table. While Pakistan is usually sidelined in discussions on South Asia, she argued that there are specific perspectives that can be gained from there. She emphasised on the links between knowledge and violence that often emerge in Pakistan in the context of the war on terror, which have implications for institutions of learning. Because of the particularity of Pakistan and its simultaneous attempts of decolonisation, she called for the need to draw parallels between different movements – decolonisation alongside desecuratisation; blacks movements alongside Islamophobia. Ahmad traced the history of decolonisation to the social movements in the Global South in the 50s and 60s.  In propagation of such criticism, scholars may make unlikely bedfellows with ethno-nationalists, Islamists and the post-colonial state that denigrate Western as ‘foreign’. Despite the tension inherent in such critique in Pakistan, the need to recognise indigenous ontologies is significant. Ahmad in particular, discussed the work of Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, an Islamic socialist scholar, in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). She also crucially interrogated universities as a site of critique of Western canon; emphasising Cambridge University’s potential of becoming such a node.
Ananya Misra, CambridgeAnanya Misra offered insight into continuing ‘internal colonialism’ in the Indian education system. By taking the case of a tribal community in mineral rich Orissa, the conflicts between the state, corporates, NGOs and the ‘tribal’ people were highlighted. Her analysis of the rise of a Sanskritised Hindu education, including the insistence on using Hindi as a protest against colonisation, drew parallels with Ahmad’s discussion of the uncomfortable apparent agreement between scholars and Islamists on decolonisation. She discussed at length the attempts to ‘civilise’ Adivasi tribes. The Vedanta schools (DAV) set up for children of displaced Adivasi population completely disregard and erase Adivasi animist culture and instead force feed Sanskritised Hinduism. The same corporate forces which evict the communities then ‘educate’ the children by bringing them to mainstream ‘culture’. She also demonstrated how the ‘othering’ of these tribal people continue, as they are often showcased in museums and local research institutes continue to view them as primitive. She also cited stories of tribal resistance; such as tribal use of religion to protect their lands, emphasising the parallel traditions of empowerment within the tribal culture.  The three different takes on decolonizing curriculum brought to question many different and conflicting views; starting from the role of history in the movement, the need to understand the ‘kind’ of colonization that took place in the different parts of the world; to the need to understand what colonization, coloniality, imperialism and decolonization means. The discussion urged us to think about the nature, categories and histories as well as the contemporary region which is South Asia.  It was thus not surprising that the talk finished with plans and promises of another series looking at other regions in Africa and around the world. Contributors:Asiya Islam is a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology and a Gates Cambridge Scholar at the University of Cambridge.

The science of ādāb al-baḥth or munāẓarah emerged relatively late in Islamic history. Its roots lay in the earlier science of eristic (jadal or khilāf) that had developed among early Islamic theologians and jurists (with some influence from Aristotelian topics and late-antique rhetoric). In this lecture, I will argue that there was an explosion of interest in the science in the Ottoman Empire in the seventeenth century. I will discuss the wider intellectual context of this development, as well as some of its consequences for the Ottoman tradition of logic.<iframe width="480" height="270" src="//sms.cam.ac.uk/media/2234952/embed" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe> Posted: Wednesday 11 May 2016 Contributor:

By relying too much on one indicator, we risk that we over focus on it.
Are there possibilities to use the tools at hand - such as observations from space and ground networks; demographic, economic and societal measures; big data statistical techniques; and numerical models - to inform politicians, managers, and the public of the evolving risks of climate change at global, regional, and local scales? Professor Kennel will be joined by Professor Stephen Briggs who will talk about planetary vital signs.About the speakers:Charles F. Kennel is Distinguished Professor, Vice-Chancellor, and Director emeritus at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California. He was educated in astronomy and astrophysics at Harvard and Princeton. He served as UCLA’s Executive Vice Chancellor, its chief academic officer, from 1996 to 1998. From 1994 to 1996, Kennel was Associate Administrator at NASA and Director of Mission to Planet Earth, a global Earth science satellite program. Kennel’s experiences at NASA influenced him to go into Earth and climate science, and he became the ninth Director and Dean of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Vice Chancellor of Marine Sciences at the University of California, San Diego, serving from 1998 to 2006.Stephen Briggs is currently the senior advisor to the ESA (European Space Agency) and the chair of the UN Global Climate Observing System. He headed the Department of “Earth Observation” (EO) Science, Applications & Future Technologies of ESA at ESRIN (European Space Research Institute). Before joining ESA in 2000, Stephen worked as Director of Earth Observation British National Space Centre & Head of Earth Observation NERC, UK (1994-1999), Head of Remote Sensing Applications Development Unit, NERC/BNSC (1986-1994), Senior Scientist at NERC Thematic Information Systems (1983-1986), and Lecturer at the Dept of Physics, Queen Mary College London (1982-1983).

Theatre and Effect in Early Modern FireworksMuch of the literature on early modern fireworks displays tends to treat them as texts, to be deciphered and read for their symbolic and allegorical content. In this talk I focus on the performative aspects of early modern pyrotechnics and the practical, material techniques used to create fireworks spectacles in the period. Under the heading theatre I explore the way fireworks were stage-managed and related to pyrotechnic images and knowledge in printed books and manuscripts. Under the heading effects, I review the performative properties of different kinds of fireworks such as sound and colour and the logic of early modern performances – the ways materials were supposed to relate to one another in order to produce effects. I conclude by showing how these performative elements were not only critical in making fireworks effective tools of state and court spectacle, but also had an impact on natural philosophy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The Role of Gunpowder in Early Modern ScienceGunpowder was a subject of interest for many early modern experimental natural philosophers. Attracted by the massive physical power given off on ignition, the early moderns experimented frequently with gunpowder. Owing to gunpowder’s most obvious application, in warfare, some of the experiments conducted had the intention of improving gunpowder—both procurement and performance. The early modern experimentalists however, especially those following Francis Bacon’s (1561-1626) projected mode of inquiry, saw gunpowder as much more than a military propellant.  Natural philosophers involved with the Hartlib Circle and early Royal Society, for example, proposed new ways of harnessing gunpowder’s energy.  Whilst gunpowder’s utility was undoubtedly important for the early modern experimentalists, there was much more to be gained from the close study of the incendiary substance. Bacon and Robert Boyle (1627-91), for example, used gunpowder to resolve disputes over matter theory. Gunpowder experiments were significant not only because they were practically interesting. They occasioned theorising over fundamental issues in early modern science.This paper explores the uses of gunpowder in early modern natural philosophy. I outline how gunpowder was used, why it was used, and the implications of its employment. Drawing on the reproduction of early modern gunpowder experiments conducted in collaboration with the Royal Armouries (Leeds), I examine precisely how gunpowder affected early modern experimental science. It will be demonstrated how gunpowder served the natural philosophers who employed it, as well as the specific challenges it posed. I argue that for early modern experimental natural philosophers gunpowder was not only about what it could do, but what it could tell us. Gunpowder was a source of potential knowledgeIf you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

What has re-ignited the debate is the realisation that the process of ‘combinatorial innovation’ in digital technology—the combination of massive increases in processing power, big data analytics, sensor technology, digital mapping and machine learning—has opened up the possibility that large numbers of non-repetitive jobs which require some cognitive skills may become amenable to automation in the foreseeable future. This kind of work—classically defined as ‘white collar’ jobs in the UK (‘middle-class’ in the US)—represents a significant proportion of current industrial and commercial employment, and significant displacement of it by technology would be a major development for societies. Estimates of the potential disruption vary, but the best-known study (by Frey and Osborne) estimates that fully 47 per cent of the 702 job categories identified by the US Bureau of Labor could now be vulnerable. At this stage, there is no way of determining whether the sceptics or the predictions are correct. This uncertainty, however, should not be the end of the discussion, but the beginning. The possibility that a significant proportion of middle-class work could be mechanised at the pace we have seen in other areas affected by digital technology is an eventuality that needs to be taken seriously, even if the probability of it happening is lower than evangelists believe. The existence of a stable middle class is a prerequisite for a viable democracy, and the prospect of it being destabilised is therefore of great interest to our Technology and Democracy project. To discuss it we have brought together four speakers, each of whom brings a different perspective to the issue. This talk is part of the Technology and Democracy Events series.If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

Drawing on ethnographic research within and across the camp and the city it traces the historical and ongoing ties between Palestinian refugees and urban minority citizens while exploring their differing sense of injustice, politics, and morality. I argue that a focus on place (camp versus city) and legal-political status (refugees versus minority citizens) alone cannot explain how and why, despite their ethnonational and kin ties, these two segments of poor Palestinians differ in how they perceive and articulate issues of survival and politics. Explaining these differences requires exploring the forms of sociolegal control they experience in their everyday lives. Specifically, it requires studying their distinct relationships with the Israeli state’s coercive agencies and, for the refugees, their protracted relationship with humanitarian organizations. The paper concludes by calling for more comparative research on the role of agencies of control in the articulation of practices and meanings of survival and politics in localities of urban marginality. A focus on the interplay between control and space can help bring the urban poor and refugees in the same analytic framework thus enriching ongoing urban sociology debates about urban marginality.If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

Jonny Darling (University of Manchester) 

Abstract 

In 2010, the UK Home Office announced that it would be passing contracts to provide dispersal accommodation and reception services for asylum seekers to a series of private providers. This meant the end of asylum accommodation through local authorities in many of the UK’s largest cities. This paper seeks to explore the impact of this shift in asylum provision and consider what this means for the relation between cities and asylum seekers in contemporary Britain. The paper draws on fieldwork in four UK cities (Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow and Sunderland), including interviews with local authority representatives, politicians, asylum and refugee support services and asylum seekers themselves. In considering this empirical evidence base, the paper argues that we may see a troubling narrative of political neglect, shrinking accountability and the slow recession of support services and expertise. As the realities of ‘austerity urbanism’ have interacted with the privatisation of asylum support, so we are witnessing the emergence of new assemblages of authority and governance at the urban level. A limited concern with the social needs of asylum seekers, has been replaced with an increasingly revanchist agenda which seeks to both remove those seeking asylum from political debate and to maximise the economic gains to be made from dispersal. In the growing and emerging ‘asylum market’, I argue that the realities of asylum urbanism are far removed from the potential for political change so often associated with the image of the city as a site of refuge. This does not, however, mean giving up on the city as a space for critical political practices. Rather, it demands a reorientation of how asylum is politicised and an approach that takes seriously the informalities of urban life. In concluding, I draw on the experience of these four cities to suggest that whilst the revanchist practices of asylum urbanism gain ground, their margins still represent contested spaces in which the image of an irregular city may be kept alive.If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

							Rise up! Rise up, Cormoran. Woden. Jack-of-Green. Jack-in-Irons. Thunderdell. Búri, Blunderbore, Gog and Magog, Galligantus, Vili and Vé, Yggdrasil, Brutus of Albion. Come, you drunken spirits. Come, you battalions. You fields of ghosts who walk these green plains still. Come, you giants!                                                     ---Johnny ‘Rooster’ Byron, in Jez Butterworth, Jerusalem (2009) At the end of Jerusalem, Johnny Byron invokes a wide range of cultural, national and mythic figures to aid his ‘curse’ against the local council. Although it’s unclear whether this act ‘succeeds’, a wide range of contemporary artists, writers and film-makers increasingly seem to pick-up where Byron leaves off. From the revival of interest in ‘Folk Horror’ to the cross-over between psychogeographic and artistic practice, from Ben Wheatley’s A Field in England (2013) to Andrew Michael Hurley’s The Loney (2015) this ‘occultural’ representation of the rural works as both a link to the past and an articulation of pressing contemporary concerns.The link between art, landscape and the visionary tradition is, of course, ancient. However, the recent, post-millennial popularity of this type of work has helped to embed a register of supernaturalism into the creative culture concerned with the 21st century life of Britain’s rural, coastal and edge-land areas. In contrast to the metropolitan focus that dominated writing of the 1990s and early 2000s (by the likes of Iain Sinclair, Zadie Smith and Chris Petit) one finds in contemporary work by John Akomfrah, Alice Oswald, English Heretic and Emily Richardson non-urban spaces populated by literal and figurative ghosts.This is the territory of The Alchemical Landscape.Working as an interdisciplinary, multi-platform research project, The Alchemical Landscape brings into collaboration the Faculty of English and the Department of Land Economy. It has two intersecting points of focus: the artistic representation of the British landscape as an uncanny if not haunted space, and the use of comparable ‘spectral’ language to speak about matters of environment, property and value. From economic ghost towns to geomantic visitations, the interest of the Alchemical Landscape project lies with the way these tropes describe the ‘natural’ landscape of contemporary Britain and its geographic, architectural and symbolic histories. Mailing list: thealchemicallandscape@gmail.comFor more information visit  The Alchemical Landscape external website.

							Graduate and Faculty Research GroupsThe Graduate/Faculty Research Groups programme supports groups of Cambridge graduate students and faculty members working together with a common interdisciplinary research interest,  bringing together early-career researchers, established academics and guest speakers on particular research topics for a year of collaborative work. Groups range in size from reading groups to full-scale symposia. Experimental forms of engagement are encouraged. Since its inception in 2006, the programme has hosted 50 groups.

The annual competition to apply for the 2017-18 academic year is now closed.
The next competition (2018-19) will be open in January 2018
Current Groups 2016-17

For further information: gradfac@crassh.cam.ac.uk The Annual Competition to apply for funding for Graduate and Faculty Research Groups  (academic year 2017-18) is now close.
The next competition 2018-19 wil be open in January 2018
 
The Graduate and Faculty Research Groups are the engine room of CRASSH’s intellectual project. We are looking to support exciting, new ideas that need detailed exploration. Groups must come from more than one faculty or department; they must have an interdisciplinary question at their core. The form of meeting can be of any type and we positively encourage experimental combinations. Some groups have been very small – a dozen people; others have grown to be major seminars. Some groups host formal papers; others combine reading groups and discussions. But every group must have at least an hour each session for genuine discussion. Each group is supported administratively and financially to meet fortnightly through the academic year at CRASSH. Above all, the intellectual work of the group must provide a stimulating forum for a cutting edge question.

Provision
CRASSH offers administrative support, funding and a venue to groups for one academic year. Funding of up to £1500 per year is offered for relevant activities, as well as administrative assistance with events, publicity and budgets. Activities may include seminars, workshops, reading/discussion groups, short visits by guest speakers to Cambridge. Successful applicants are offered a regular bi-weekly, two-hour slot in one of the seminar rooms at ARB (see facilities), during term time for their sessions.  Groups may also apply for one-day workshops or colloquia. A webpage on the CRASSH website is created for each group, which includes a brief summary of the group, convener information and the events programme for the academic year.

Eligibility
Graduate Research Groups:  Lead applicants should be Cambridge graduate students from at least two different faculties/disciplines. Each group should also be supported by at least two Faculty advisors from two different disciplines. Faculty Research Groups:  Applicants should be two Cambridge CTOs/UTOs and/or postdoctoral researchers from at least two different disciplines.In both cases support will not normally be given to groups whose activities could be supported within a single Faculty. Details of activities funded so far and links to previous groups may be found here. Research groups will be selected by a panel led by the Director and Deputy-Director of CRASSH. The Graduate/Faculty Programme Manager will co-ordinate the selection process and inform the applicants of the result by the end of  May.

How to Apply
The Online Application can be found here in January 2018. Please do not sent the applications by post or email. Only Online Application will be accepted.

Proposals should give an account of the interdisciplinary nature of the research project and its contribution to disciplinary development. In addition, applicants should provide information about previous activities (if any), plans for future activities with a preliminary budget outline, and evidence of an existing network/constituency across University departments. CRASSH is keen to support wide-ranging activities and to encourage new collaborative initiatives that reach across disciplinary boundaries, including those between the sciences and the humanities.Interested applicants should discuss their plans with relevant teaching and/or research faculty in the areas involved, and are also invited to discuss proposals with the Director, Professor Simon Goldhill, or the Deputy Director, Dr. Jan-Melissa Schramm. Proposals should be accompanied by two letters of support from referees, at least one of whom should be from Cambridge, and one of whom may also serve as the Group's Faculty Advisor in the event that the proposal is successful. 
Referees must be submit their comments via the online system by the deadline.

Re-applying Groups
Groups coming to the end of their funded period are welcome to re-apply by completing the application form and submitting it, along with their  Yearly Report 2017-18 (form will be found here) by ----- April 2018 (noon). Please include your report as part of the application (one document) when you upload to the Online Application System.

CRASSH, University of CambridgeThis project will investigate the interface between the study of the bible and the study of antiquity in the nineteenth century. These two areas – the bible and classics – are central to the intellectual world of the nineteenth century, a source of knowledge, contention, and authority both as discrete topics, and, more importantly, in relation to and in competition with one another. It is impossible to understand Victorian society without appreciating the intellectual, social and institutional force of these concerns with the past. Yet modern disciplinary formation has not only separated them in the academy, but also marginalized both subject areas – which has deeply attenuated comprehension of this foundational era. Our project will bring together scholars working on a range of fields including classics, history of education, cultural history, art history, literary history to bring back into view a fundamental but deeply misunderstood and under explored aspect of the nineteenth century, which continues to have a significant impact on the contemporary world.Contact the Bible and Antiquity project.DirectorsProfessor Simon Goldhill, PI (CRASSH/Classics, University of Cambridge)

At the same time 'comic epidemics' have risen to be a popular theme in the realm of graphic novels proper, with works like The Walking Dead or the Argentinean best-seller Dengue dwelling upon the graphic narration of imaginary outbreaks to communicate commentaries on social collapse, survival ethics and the human condition at large.Though often illustrating historical or anthropological works of epidemic disease, the comic figuration of epidemics has remained an analytically unexamined area. We are soliciting papers from across the social sciences and the medical humanities that examine the emergence, utilisation and transformation of comics, caricatures and animation in relation to epidemic disease, and the prospects and risks of their use in epidemic prevention, preparedness and control.Those interested in participating in the conference should send a title and abstract of 300-400 words to Lukas Engelmann (lukas.engelmann@ed.ac.uk) and Christos Lynteris (cl537@cam.ac.uk) by 15 December 2017.Successful applicants from the call for papers will be offered two nights' accommodation in Cambridge and up to £100 in support towards travel costs. For more information, please visit the conference homepage.  We invite papers from across the social sciences and humanities (anthropology, history, geography, economics, political sciences, development studies) and from emerging and established scholars, to contribute to an interdisciplinary workshop aimed at re-theorizing contemporary and historic cooperative practice.There has been considerable and sustained interested in cooperatives across the humanities and social sciences. Yet these approaches, which centre upon cooperatives’ status as economic organizations, political projects, and sites of meaning and value-making, remain largely siloed within specific disciplines. In anthropology, political science, and sociology, much of the debate has centred on whether cooperatives constitute a launch-pad for radical departures from prevailing social and economic conditions, or whether they instead reinforce the status quo. Other work, particularly in economics and development studies, has focused on more explicitly descriptive and applied ends: analysing the structure, efficiency, and successes/failures of particular cooperative projects, often in order to contribute to the advancement of cooperative entities overall.What can we gain from bringing these strands of research together? Is it possible for us to move discussions of cooperatives beyond a consideration of structural politics and applied approaches, and what are the implications of this? What other (shared) avenues of analysis are open to us as cooperative scholars?Participants are invited to consider the following:Please send a 300-word abstract and short CV to Corinna Howland, cfh39 [at] cam.ac.uk by 20 December 2017. Applicants will be notified if they have been accepted by 5 January 2018.Successful applicants will then be asked to submit a 3000-word paper by April 20th, 2018 for circulation among the workshop participants. This, together with a fifteen-minute presentation, will form the basis of the workshop discussions.Accommodation, lunches, and a workshop dinner will be provided for speakers.For more information, please visit the workshop homepage.Paper at a recycling depot in Cumbria, UK © Ashley Cooper http://www.globalwarmingimages.net/index.htmlIf you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

							In recent decades, the theory and practice of translation has become an increasingly prominent area of academic discussion and debate. Offering important opportunities for interdisciplinary research, this flourishing field inevitably promotes interactions across and within a wide range of different discourses. However, the University of Cambridge currently has no institutional infrastructure devoted to such work, and those interested in translation tend to be confined to informal fragmentary clusters that rarely converge. The Cambridge Conversations in Translation (CCiT) research group seeks to rectify this by providing a forum in which anyone and everyone with an active interest in translation can meet to exchange ideas about this rich and complex subject.A series of panel discussions and workshops will bring together practitioners and scholars from fields as diverse as literary studies, linguistics, theology, history, music, philosophy, and anthropology to consider and respond to what we anticipate will be provocative insights from our invited speakers. The resulting discussions will encourage an engagement with both practice and theory as they draw on the experiences of professional translators alongside more speculative theoretical frameworks and methodologies.Themes 2017-18

Up to ten fellows  are appointed each year. The scheme is also open to UTOs and CTOs working in the department of Geography (supported by the School of Physical Sciences).
The competiton for  2018-19 has now closed. 
Eligibility
All UTOs and CTOs who have been in post for less than five years at date of application are eligible, provided that they have obtained prior permission from their Faculty and/or College. UTOs must apply for leave under Statute D,II,6 (b) and the period of leave granted will not be reckonable for purposes of entitlement to sabbatical leave (granted under statute D,II,5).  This is a residential fellowship and successful applicants are expected to spend their period of research leave in Cambridge.

Provision
CRASSH  provides a forum for presenting work-in-progress and mentoring support through regular contact with its visiting fellows and interdisciplinary research community. The value of the award is set at a flat rate of £2,000 per fellow per term (if Easter Term leave is requested, the sum is reduced to £1,000). This amount will be transferred to the fellow’s Faculty or College to enable replacement teaching to be bought in. If the fellow’s teaching is split between a Faculty and a College, it will be the responsibility of the Faculty to negotiate the amount passed on to the college (up to a maximum of half the total).Michaelmas Term 2017Dr Edoardo Gallo (Economics)

Dr Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh, Executive Director CSER
 The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk is an interdisciplinary research centre focused on the study of risks threatening human extinction that may emerge from technological advances. CSER aims to combine key insights from the best minds across disciplines to tackle the greatest challenge of the coming century: safely harnessing our rapidly-developing technological power.

An existential risk is one that threatens the existence of our entire species.  The Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) — a joint initiative between philosopher Huw Price, cosmologist Martin Rees, and software entrepreneur Jaan Tallinn — was founded on the conviction that these risks require a great deal more scientific investigation than they presently receive. The Centre’s aim is to develop a new science of existential risk, and to develop protocols for the investigation and mitigation of technology-driven existential risks.

CSER is hosted within the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH), under the management of Dr Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh. The Centre's Management Committee is supported by an international Advisory Board. See the CSER project website for more information.CSER’s current research agenda comprises two main strands:Details of our current projects can be found on the adjoining pages.

Natural versus anthropogenic extinction risksProfessor Stuart J. Russell  (University of California, Berkeley)  - The Long-Term Future of (Artificial) IntelligenceProfessor Margaret Boden (University of Sussex) - Human-level AI: Is it Looming of Illusory?A Conversation on the Future of Intelligence (Cambridge Alumni Festival Event)October 2015 – September 2018Executive SummaryWe know of natural risks to our species, such as asteroid impacts.  We also know that we threaten our own existence, e.g., by nuclear war.  Such home-grown extreme risks have been with us for decades.  But many distinguished scientists are now concerned that developments in technology (e.g., in AI or biotechnology) may soon pose more direct catastrophic threats.  The new capabilities of such technologies might place the power to do catastrophic harm in dangerously few human hands, or (in the case of AI) take it out of our hands altogether.The nature and level of such extreme technological risks (ETRs) is at present difficult to assess, because they have received little serious scientific attention.  The need to consider them is a new one, but one we seem likely to face for the foreseeable future, as technology becomes even more powerful.   hence it is crucial that we investigate these risks seriously, and learn how they can best be managed, in the long term.  The purpose of the new Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), within which this project is based, is to lead the international scientific community in conducting research on these issues.This project begins with a preliminary model of the components needed for the study and management of ETR. We will refine the model by implementing some of it, and by learning from our successes and failures.  In this way, we will clarify both the present ETRs themselves, and how risks of this class should be managed in the future.  Our outputs will be both theoretical (e.g., scientific papers) and practical (e.g., establishing best practices for ETR mitigation).  In the process, we will greatly expand the community of scholars, technologists and policy-makers who are aware of the task of managing ETRs, and do much to define their understanding of the nature of this task.  By this means, in the long term, we hope to reduce substantially the rusk that our species will not survive its own technological success.Managing Extreme Technological Risk is a three-year project funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation within the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER). The project Managing Extreme Technological Risk is linked primarily to the first strand of CSER’s research agenda.  It consists of a number of subprojects:This subproject aims to examine the limitations of standard cost-benefit analysis (CBA) as a means of assessing the importance of mitigating extreme technological risk (ETR); to develop a version of CBA more suitable to this context; and derive conclusions about the importance of mitigating ETR compared to other global priorities. Relevant disciplines include: Philosophy (especially moral philosophy, applied ethics, and formal decision theory) and Economics (e.g., the economics of sustainability, the theory of future discounting).Successful management of ETR is likely to require early detection. This subproject aims to optimise the horizon-scanning and foresight techniques available for this task, and to understand the similarities and differences between the case of ETR and other horizon-scanning applications. Relevant disciplines include: Zoology and Ecology, Conservation Studies, Science and Technology Studies, Psychology.This subproject asks what can be done to encourage risk-awareness and societal responsibility, without discouraging innovation, within the communities developing future technologies with transformative potential. Relevant disciplines include: Science and Technology Studies, Geography, Philosophy of Science, plus relevant technological fields (e.g., AI, Virology, Synthetic biology).This subproject (a) explores the hypothesis that the culture of science is in some ways ill-adapted to successful long-term management of extreme technological risk (ETR); and (b) investigates the option of ‘tweaking’ scientific practice, so as to improve its suitability for this special task. It will examine topics including inductive risk, use and limitations of the precautionary principle, and the case for scientific pluralism and ‘breakout thinking’ where extreme technological risk is concerned. Relevant disciplines include: Philosophy of Science, Ethics, Science and Technology Studies, Sociology.Unlike the previous subprojects, this subproject focuses on a key challenge relating to the long-term safe development of one of CSER’s core focus technologies: artificial intelligence. It will investigate technical and philosophical problems at the intersection of AI and philosophical decision theory, including a rigorous characterization of the the problem of decision-theoretic stability under algorithmic self-improvement. Relevant disciplines include: Mathematics, Computer Science, Philosophical Decision Theory.If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

The CDI is a focus for collaboration and innovation at the graduate level and beyond, complementing other activities initiated within the CRASSH themes Cultural Transmission, Disciplinary Change, The Future University, Cultures and Politics of the Transregional and, for 2013-15, The Location of Knowledge.  Since its start, the CDI has sponsored a wide range of activities focused around the following programmes at CRASSH:Graduate/Faculty Research Groups
Mellon CDI Visiting Fellows Programme
Collaborative Teaching Fellowships
A series of conferences focused on disciplinary change across the Humanities, the first, Changing the Humanities/the Humanities Changing, in July 2009, coinciding with the University's 800th celebrations.  The follow-up event, The Future University was held on 30 June - 2 July 2011. A third Mellon CDI conference, The Location of Knowledge, was held on Friday 8 March 2013.About the Consortium of Centres for Disciplinary InnovationThe CDI forms part of a Mellon-funded international consortium. The other partner humanities centres are The Franke Institute (University of Chicago), The Heyman Center for the Humanities (University of Columbia) and The Townsend Center (University of California at Berkeley).Growing out of a Mellon-funded initiative at the Franke Institute (New Perspectives on the Humanities: Comparative Studies in Higher Education), the consortium will collectively address the problem of how universities in the twenty-first century can best respond to the challenge of disciplinary change in the humanities and social sciences (and beyond). Each of these universities has been characterised by their intellectual vitality and by the wish to reflect on the structures and procedures of disciplinary knowledge. The four Centers will pursue their programmatic activities according to the local strengths and needs of their institutions. Aims and Activities of the ConsortiumThe aim of the Consortium is to link disciplinary innovation with curricular change. At Cambridge, building on  programmes recently launched at CRASSH for graduate/faculty research groupus and for early career fellowships, the focus will be on disciplinary innovation at graduate level and on linking research to the curriculum. Drawing Cambridge graduates and faculty into the work of the Centre, the CRASSH programmes encourage the piloting of interdisciplinary courses at both graduate and undergraduate level.The Chicago programme focuses on development in graduate education with a series of team-taught courses involving both Chicago faculty and invited faculty. The Columbia programme will sponsor a series of disciplinary retreats on the major disciplines to reflect on possibilities for new structures and linkages at graduate and undergraduate level. The Berkeley programme focuses on the undergraduate curriculum, tracing thematic 'threads' through multiple disciplines in relation to undergraduate concentrations. The consortium will meet annually during the project2015-16Lent 2016

CRASSH is now soliciting proposals from members of Cambridge University faculty for collaborative  seminar courses to be taught at CRASSH in Michaelmas Term 2016 or Lent 2017. Courses should be co-taught by two people from different disciplinary areas, Faculties, or Schools. Proposals should present their rationale in relation to interdisciplinarity and/or disciplinary innovation. These courses should not normally be ones that could be offered within a single Faculty or existing curricular structure. Proposals will be selected by a committee including the two Heads of Schools.CRASSH seminar courses should be designed to encourage dialogue across disciplines, stimulate research-led teaching, or pilot a course for a new MPhil. or Tripos paper. They should be designed with graduate students (including PhD students) in mind as participants. The Teaching Fellowship scheme will provide compensation directly to the Faculties and/or colleges at the rate of £6.5K per fellow. Courses will count towards the Teaching Fellow's Faculty/University teaching stint and release them from other teaching during the term of their Fellowship and they will be expected to become part of the CRASSH research community. Information about previous recipients is available here.Joint proposals, including a rationale, detailed description, outline syllabus and term requested should be submitted electronically to the Administrator, CRASSH, Alison Richard Building, 7 West Road, Cambridge CB3 9DT, accompanied by both CVs. Prospective co-applicants are invited to consult the Director, Simon Goldhill,  about their proposed course and should have discussed their application ahead of time with Faculty and/or college, who should supply a letter of support to accompany application.If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

The first is to foster a more dynamic understanding of the history of WWII in China; the second is to function as a spur to making the history of WWII truly global.The Summer Institute will take place 3 - 15 July 2017 at CRASSH, University of Cambridge, with presentations by invited guest speakers and early career scholars selected through an application process.  The deadline for applications to participate in the Summer Institute has now passed.Principle InvestigatorConvenersConfirmed guest speakersSupportThe Institute is made possible by a grant from the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) and the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange (CCKF); we are grateful for their support.     World War Two has become something like the axial moment of our times, an event that shaped not just the geopolitical contours of the world in which we now live, but also our moral bearings, our identities, and our sense of the past. If this is true for most Western countries, it has also become the case for China. Now that communism (and, to an extent, consumerism) has lost its grip on the public imagination in China, the country’s leaders have turned to China’s war with Japan to construct a new, more inclusive, narrative of the emergence of New China, one which has allowed the healing of wounds resulting from class war, but which China’s leaders are also exploiting to justify a dominant role for China in East Asia.The Summer Institute has two main objectives. The first is to foster a more dynamic understanding of the history of WWII in China. Beginning in the late 1980s, much work has been done in China and in the UK and the USA to account more fully for China’s role in WWII. Much of that history remains traditional in its approach, recounting battles, tracing international relations, and narrating personal conflicts. By examining the writings of poets, dramatists, and authors, by analysing the work of painters, cartoonists, musicians, and film makers, and by studying the many works of history and other forms of scholarship written in the period, the Institute will recover the intellectual vitality and creativity of the period, and so provide a spur to less politicized and ideological readings of China’s wartime past as well as to a proper accounting of the role of the humanities in (and at) war.China in WWII was not simply the USA’s and the UK’s junior partner. During her famous tour of the USA in 1943, Madame Chiang Kaishek became America’s favourite Asian other, an antidote to Japan, of course, but also a beacon of a new post-imperialist world, deliberately so fashioned by the Roosevelt Administration, in part to boost Chinese morale but also to contain Churchill’s imperialist instincts. Mao Zedong took to reading Clausewitz while trying to evolve a strategy for revolutionary success while sitting in his cave in the Yan’an Mountains. Indian Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru discussed Asia’s future with Chiang Kaishek in a Chongqing bomb shelter hiding from Japanese bombing raids. The second aim, then, of the Institute is to move scholarship on from its tired focus on US – China relations to one much more fully aware of the diversities and richness of the international and Chinese domestic context of the war.  A longer range aim of the Institute is to function as a spur to making the history of WWII truly global. Especially in military history, World War II remains told as the fight by the Allies against Germany in Europe and Japan in East Asia. Large areas of the world – the Middle East, continental East Asia, South-East Asia, and Africa – are largely overlooked. By approaching the topic in an interdisciplinary way and by bringing a broad range of humanities subjects to bear on it, we hope that a convincing case emerges for a more globally aware, a more cosmopolitan, and a less ideological approach to an event that does indeed continue to shape our time in profound time. 'War and Flower' by Feng ZikaiIn Feng, Manhua de Miaofao (Shanghai, Kaiming, 1948), p.21If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

The city is a space made of, and build around, heterogeneous margins. Borders, both empirical and conceptual, divide the city's centre from its periphery; trace the contours of zones of access on the basis of income, race, and gender; split the city into private and public zones. Some borders segregate (the poor from the rich) and others isolate (the rich from the poor). The urban life along the borders and inside the margins often does not conform to the idea of the productive urban citizen. The margins are the spaces of minority groups, migrants, homeless deviants, illegals.

The seminar explores urban marginality from a variety of perspectives - political and economic exclusion, marginalisation on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, and religion, to name just a few - in order to question how these margins are produced, sustained, and reproduced in contemporary cities, both in the Global North and South. It aims to challenge the canonical understanding of life at the margin in order to cast a new light on what we consider to be, and what we know of, contemporary urban marginalisation. ConvenersHanna Baumann (Department of Architecture)

The programme to date has focused on infrastructural design, (re)construction and maintenance, and on 'matter' as locus of staggered, juxtaposed and disjointed temporalities of the civic. Moving out from considerations of civic matter in respect of its spatio-temporal extension, this series proposes to examine the 'matter' of civic life (built, landscaped, public, aesthetic) as sensory, embodied, and resonant, in terms of the articulation of materiality with civic affect and sociability. In this formulation, civic matter is alternately fugitive and invasive, elusive and intrusive, as much personal as mediated and social, constituted precisely of what eludes systematic social scientific research and of what emerges in the nexus of affect and performance.As such, civic matter is attractive, amenable, subject to, and constitutive of a range of novel performance and research interventions and enterprises across the arts, humanities and social sciences. The proposed Faculty Research Group aims to articulate and consolidate converging methodological interests among organisers, speakers, and audiences at CRASSH in the materiality, context, violence, play and inequity emergent in the experiential dimensions of the civic and infrastructural, our subject matter in the 2013-14 series. This programme seeks to bring together thinkers from geography and urban planning, environmental history, art practice and performance, the anthropology of movement, and sonic arts and ethnomusicology to discern and interrogate the resonances and sensory life of civic matter, as it networks amid, constitutes and exceeds the infrastructural with which we have been hitherto concerned.ConvenersProfessor P Wenzel Geissler  (Director of Research, Division of Social Anthropology, Cambridge and University of Oslo)

							Climate Histories Interdisciplinary Discussion Series/ Paris 2015This Faculty Research Group was funded in 2011 and co-convened by the Departments of Social Anthropology, Geography, and the Engineering Department's Centre for Sustainable Development. It brings together people from a range of academic and non-academic backgrounds including the sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences, and those working within policy, industry, activism, and media. Together we discuss past, present, and future environments and debate how to tackle the challenges presented by the changing climate.

The key questions we ask are:For the upcoming academic year (2015-2016) the seminar series will be based on the upcoming Paris 2015 climate conference, which is to feature global political leaders and determine the future of climate change politics for decades to come. Paris 2015 will be a crucial conference as it aims to achieve a new international agreement on the climate applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C.
Throughout the seminar series we will invite specialists with a direct connection to, or research interest in, specific themes that feature during the Paris 2015 conference, including among others the 2˚c limit; the relationship between science and policy; political engagement with climate change; the role of religion and morality; issues surrounding gender and indigenous knowledge and the role of government in mitigating against climate-induced challenges. Supported by our broad network of researchers and participants the seminars will be structured according to three sub-themes corresponding to the three terms of the year:

2014-15The Climate Histories Interdisciplinary Seminar is about bringing  together and expanding a network of people from different backgrounds (sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences, as well as people working in policy, media, and industry) to tackle questions about climate and environmental change in the past, present, and future.The general questions we ask as a network are: Why does environmental knowledge matter? What can we learn about climate change from history? How can different disciplines work together to develop our understanding? (See our website created for a one-year AHRC  network project at http://climatehistories.innerasiaresearch.org/ )The aim of the seminar series will be to share knowledge, start conversations, and work towards new ways of thinking for future research projects.ConvenersDr Heather Cruickshank  (Department of Engeineering, Centre for Sustainable  Development)

							CRASSH supports an annual programme of conferences and workshops. Funding of up to £2,500, plus administrative support, is available to college and university faculty and graduate students of the University of Cambridge.  The competition for conference support in 2018-19 is now open. We are accepting applications for conferences taking place between September 2018 and July 2019.The application portal can be accessed here: http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/applications/position/view/100.The deadline for applications is 12.00pm (GMT) on Friday 26 January 2018. If you have any questions about the competition then please email Oliver Wright, CRASSH's Conference & Events Manager, on odw22@cam.ac.uk.A sample budget is available here, and a sample conference programme is available here.  Please note that references are not required for the conference competition. You may receive an email from the application system that mentions referees - this can be disregarded. The package offered for a typical two-day conference is up to £2,500 in financial support for speaker travel, hospitality and accommodation. CRASSH support also includes administrative assistance and a conference venue. One-day workshops may be supported with a pro rata financial contribution. Applications for financial support always automatically include the in-kind contribution. Convenors are however able to apply for the in-kind support only. Two-day conferences are typically offered up to £2,500 in financial support. A one-day event would be supported with a maximum pro rata contribution of £1,250.Convenors would generally need to find additional funding to cover some costs to ensure that the maximum financial contribution from CRASSH is not exceeded, especially as it is CRASSH's policy not to pay for honoraria or publications.For reference, the average total cost of a conference supported via the competition over 2016-17 was around £5,500. A list of other potential funding sources can be found in the ‘additional funding’ tab.A sample conference budget is available here.Please note that any unspent sums below the maximum agreed revert to the CRASSH conference support fund. The CRASSH conference facilities at the Alison Richard Building will be available to convenors. We are also willing to support conferences that will take place at other venues within Cambridge.Administrative assistance includes:AV assistance is typically available in the Alison Richard Building during normal working hours.

As our funds are limited (we estimate that we will be able to support around 20 conferences in this competition), the emphasis is on using CRASSH resources to enhance their academic dimension.We encourage conference organisers to make ample provision for discussion and for the participation of graduate students. A sample programme can be found here.Workshops related to externally funded projects may also be eligible for administrative support only; please state clearly the funds already available.Selection will be made on the basis of the following:Convenors are strongly advised to seek additional funding to top up what CRASSH is able to offer, for instance to bring overseas speakers or offer student bursaries.

Post-democracies: interdisciplinary engagements after the democratic ideal15 April 2013, Social Anthropology, Free School Lane, Cambridge CB3 9DTIn recent years, the promise of emancipatory democratic statehood has inspired uprisings, revolutions, and unilateral interventions into other nations' affairs. 'Democracy' appears to be a cherished value for the actors in such situations. Yet ethnographic research is making some intriguing discoveries in this regard. Growing numbers of former pro-democracy activists in emerging democracies such as Indonesia or Kenya have come to view the democratic ideal with suspicion or disdain, perceiving it to be inherently ineffective or morally flawed. In the established democracies of Europe and North America, apparent advocates of democratic principles now seem to be tacitly renouncing them in favour of technocratic managerialism, and ‘apathetic’ forms of citizenship. Why? Our conference aims to solve this puzzle.Beyond the authority of the ‘text’: performance as paradigm, past and present16 April 2013, CRASSH, Alison Richard Building, 7 West Road, Cambridge CB3 9DTPerformance as a paradigm repositions the intelligibility of works of art as a function of their mixed and multiple audiences: simultaneously implied and actual; individual and collective; past and present - audiences which precede, as well as follow, acts of creation. Performance as an angle of approach asks who an artwork is for, assuming a multiple and complex answer. It views all artworks as implicitly public forms of messaging, or rather, suggests a view of the work as time-specific gesture rather than object, however individually created or consumed. As Simon English said of his land art project ‘England’ on BBC Radio 4, ‘The artwork is us discussing it now.’ Latin American Utopian Visions: A Critical Look for the 21st Century19 April 2013, CRASSH, Alison Richard Building, 7 West Road, Cambridge CB3 9DTLatin America currently stands at a crossroads.

Democracy, citizen participation, participatory budgeting, human rights, resource nationalization, and pan-indigenous projects have all, at varying moments and in different ways, been invoked as fundamental principles for forging a new ideal future. At this critical juncture, a re-examination of the role of idealist visions in Latin America’s political programs and cultural production can reveal the multiple entanglements and implicit assumptions underlying these visions.Remembering JB Trend: the quiet internationalist22 April 2013, Clare College, CambridgeThis symposium celebrates the life and work of J B Trend, the first Professor of Spanish in Cambridge, and a central figure in the history of Hispanism.

	In this conference, our contributors look at the question of whether cognition itself occurs solely ‘in human brains’, or whether cognition should instead be properly thought of as occurring partly in embodied action, or partly in extra-bodily artefacts (Clark and Chalmers 1998).A major, two-day international conference reconceptualising modernist artistic practices from a transnational, interdisciplinary perspective.2011-12 ConferencesConference programmeFilming Transnational Interiors27 September 2012, Arts Picturehouse Cinema and Winstanley Lecture Theatre, Trinity College, CambridgeThis conference seeks to explore the representation and conceptualization of interior space in cinema, in the context of the transnational relations and identities that inform both spaces and the films that project them. The conference will examine the idea that the intimate architectures of homes and dwelling places, whether of a transitory or more rooted nature, both shape and are shaped by the identities of those that inhabit them.If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

CRASSH, University of CambridgeTheories and beliefs about conspiracies are an enduring feature of modern societies. This is partly a reflection of the fact that real conspiracies do exist, and have existed in the past. But the pervasiveness of conspiracy theories in the twenty-first century suggests that many other factors are also at work, And studying them provides opportunities for understanding how people make sense of the world and how societies function. What does the prevalence of conspiracy theories tell us about trust in democratic societies, and about the differences between cultures and societies? How have conspiracies and conspiracy theorising changed over the centuries and what, if any, is the relationship between them? Have conspiracy theories appeared at particular moments in history, and why?This ambitious, five-year, interdisciplinary research project aims to explore these and related questions. It sets out not to debunk particular theories  but to provide a "natural history" of conspiracy theorising. To do that, the project combines the perspectives, investigative methods and insights of historians, political theorists, network engineers and other disciplines to produce what we hope will be a deeper and richer understanding of a fascinating and puzzling phenomenon.Please follow the link to visit the project website and blog.DirectorsProfessor Sir Richard J Evans (CRASSH, Cambridge)

We do not know if such conversions are inward turnings towards a better life or monstrous impositions upon unwitting victims. We cannot fathom how individuals or groups of people are able to convert to a new politics, religion, or way of life all at once and quite completely, as if they had never been other than what they have become. We would not want to part with the freedom of self- determination embodied in conversion, which seems to be its purest expression, even though we are troubled by what radical transformations tell us about the instability and changeability of human beings.Among other goals, the Forms of Conversion project will develop an historical understanding of conversion that will enlighten modern debates about corporeal, sexual, psychological, political and spiritual kinds of transformation. The project will study how early modern Europeans changed their confessional, social, political and even sexual identities. These subjective changes were of a piece with transformations in their world—the geopolitical reorientation of Europe in light of emerging relations with Islam and the Americas; the rethinking and the translation of the knowledge of Greek and Latin Antiquity, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; changes in and changing uses of the built environment; the reimagining of God.For further information about this project please contact Simon Goldhill at CRASSH.
The Early Modern Conversions: Religions, Cultures, Cognitive Ecologies is hosted by the Institute for the Public Life of Arts and Ideas (IPLAI) at McGill University and funded by a Partnership Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), Canada.CRASSH appoints two visiting fellows, each for a term, to research the topic of conversion in the Early Modern period. The two fellows work on a project connected to the theme of conversion, and contribute to the interdisciplinary, collaborative international project Early Modern Conversions: Religions, Cultures, Cognitive Ecologies by participating in the events of the network sponsored by CRASSH. They also contribute to the interdisciplinary work of CRASSH through participation in its work in progress seminar. This Fellowship will not be continued after 2017-18.2017-18

CRASSH and the Faculty of English, University of CambridgeThis project uncovers the interface between imaginative literature and epistemology in its wider sense in early modern England (1500–1700). This period of intense literary production also saw the cultural forces of humanism and the Reformation collide; crucial shifts in the law; scientific advancement; and dramatic expansion in trade and travel. At stake across the board was knowledge: its theories and technologies, its excitements and anxieties. We examine intersections between literary forms and apparently disparate areas of thinking about ways of knowing; at the same time, we remain attentive to the thresholds between these more explicitly epistemic disciplines. Research is to be organised along the four disciplinary strands in the first four years, with literary intervention as a running thread. The final year will consolidate the project with specific events.Subsequent disciplinary segregation has obscured the understood relations among these disciplines: epistemic transactions vital to the experiences of knowledge and belief which so deeply vexed and shaped the period’s thought.Our point of entry is the specific intervention of literary texts in this conversation. What does literature know, or tell us, that other discourses cannot, or do not, because of their disciplinary investments? What aspirations to objectivity or assurance will it not share with science, religion or the law? How does it complicate economic ideas of insurance by translating them to affective notions of risk and surety? And crucially, how do these cognate practices engage with literary constitutions of knowledge? To recover the multiple frame against which this culture articulates its conceptions of knowledge, we read these fields as coeval but distinct. We grapple with the methods of each discipline; in our deployment of literary engagements, we do not posit literature as ethically superior but as methodologically productive for this enquiry. Through the thematic foci of knowing and knowingness, doubt and unknowing, we aim to recover a so-far uncharted history of the blind spots of knowledge, thereby rewriting the story of early modern epistemology.This project, based jointly at the Faculty of English and CRASSH, is funded by an ERC Consolidator Grant, and is led by Dr Subha Mukherji, Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of English.  Funded by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ ERC grant agreement no 617849.For further information please contact crossroads@crassh.cam.ac.uk.Principal InvestigatorDr Subha Mukherji (English, University of Cambridge)Post-doctoral Research AssociatesDr Rachel E.

Under the right circumstances, she also shows interest in gender, sexuality, colonialism, Classics, and Shakespeare. Along with the books listed above, she is the co-editor of Religion and Culture in Renaissance England (1997) and contributed the essay on early Stuart religious literature to the new Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature (2002); she has also published articles on Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, Milton, Donne, Jonson, Middleton, rhetoric, hagiography, and mirrors. She has been a fellow at the the Liguria Study Center, the National Humanities Center, the Huntington Library, and the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, as well as recipient of Guggenheim, NEH, and UC President's fellowships. Recent graduate seminars have focused on political theory from antiquity through the late Middle Ages, 17th century life-writing, Elizabethan religious prose, the sacred literature of the Jacobean era, early modern English law, Saint Augustine, and Renaissance commentaries on Paul's Epistle to the Romans.Professor Brian Cummings (University of York)Professor Cummings  was appointed at York in October 2012 as one of sixteen Anniversary Professors appointed across the arts and sciences to promote the University’s international research profile in its 50th year. Before moving there he was Professor of English at the University of Sussex, where he co-founded the Centre for Early Modern Studies in 2004. In Spring 2014 he was Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the University of Toronto, based at the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies. He has also held Visiting Fellowships in Los Angeles, Munich, and Oxford, and he was previously Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Among a number of academic honours he has given the Shakespeare Birthday Lecture in Washington D.C. in 2014, the Clarendon Lectures in Oxford in 2012-13, and the British Academy Shakespeare Lecture in 2012. From 2009-2012 he held a Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship, and in 2007 he was a British Academy Exchange Fellow. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, one of the oldest learned societies in the world.2015-2016 - Economic History StrandProfessor Valerie Forman (NYU Gallatin)Professor Forman’s research and teaching interests lie in the literature and culture of 16th- and 17th-century England and Europe, the early modern Caribbean, early modern drama, early modern women writers, early modern economic history and political theory, and Marxist theory. She received a PhD in literature from UC Santa Cruz, where she specialized in Renaissance and 17th-century English literature and culture and 16th-century French literature. Before coming to Gallatin, Professor Forman taught in the Department of English at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Her first book, Tragicomic Redemptions:  Global Economics and the Early Modern English Stage (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), explores the relationship between innovations in the theatre and new economic practices necessary to the beginnings of global trade, including that among England, the East Indies, and the Ottoman Empire. Her second book project, which turns to trade and cultural relations in the Caribbean, is entitled Developing New Worlds: Property, Freedom, and the Economics of Representation in Early Modern England and the Caribbean. She teaches courses on theatre and politics, labor, and global markets, and the rise of globalization in the early modern period.Dr Ceri Sullivan (Cardiff University)Dr Sullivan's first career was in the City of London as a senior charterted accountant and banking analyst and her second as a Finance Director through VSO. She now teaches early modern literature and modern political drama and her research interests deal with whether one may persuade oneself in devotion, focusing on  Catholic texts in her publication (Dismembered Rhetoric: English Recusant Writing 1580-1603).  Further publications explore how a merchant represents himself and reads others'  representations in the real and dramatic markets (The Rhetoric of Credit:  Merchants in Early Modern Writing). and whether, if the conscience  is structured as a language, the consequence of the divine I am is You aren't  (The Rhetoric of the Conscience in Donne, Herbert and Vaughan). Her  next book will be Private Prayer in Shakespeare's Histories. Imagine a society where every single adult was trained in - and practised - composing short original texts, every single day. This project asks an audacious but compelling question: at the turn of the seventeenth century, did changes in writing private prayers underlie major developments in drama? Required to pray independently, convinced their private prayers had an impact on the course of events, the laity developed literary - indeed, specifically dramatic - skills: in characterisation, in counter-factual narrative, and in striking verbal forms. Playwrights interested in experiments in form, particularly Shakespeare, gleefully seized on this novel expertise in their audience.2016-2017 - Natural Philosophy StrandProfessor Jonathan Sawday (Saint Louis University)Professor Jonathan Sawday studied English at Queen Mary College (University of London) and University College London, where he took his PhD in Renaissance Literature. He has taught at British, Irish, and American universities, most recently at the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, Scotland where he held the Chair in English Studies. He has held fellowships at the Huntington Library (California), the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, and been a visiting scholar in the Centre for Renaissance Studies at the Newberry Library in Chicago. He has held awards and grants from the Fulbright Association, the British Academy, The British Council, and the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council. He is a Fellow of the English Association (FEA), the Royal Society for the Arts (FRSA), and of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS). He is on the advisory board of the Journal for Literature and Science and on the editorial boards of Medical Humanities and Writing Technologies. Professor Sawday is a cultural historian. His research is focused on the intersection between science, technology, and literature particularly (but not exclusively) in the early-modern period. Currently, he is working on the idea of blanks or voids in literature, art, and culture. He is also working on an intellectual biography of Robert Burton (1577-1640), the inscrutable author of The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), the first (and probably longest) psychoanalytic work published in English. Dr Michael Witmore (Folger Shakespeare Library)Dr. Witmore was appointed the seventh director of the Folger on July 1, 2011. Upon his arrival, he worked with the Board of Governors to draft a Strategic Plan for the institution, adopted in June 2013. He was formerly professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and before that he served as associate professor of English and assistant professor of English at Carnegie Mellon University. The recipient of numerous fellowships, he has held an Andrew Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles, a research fellowship and a curatorial residency fellowship at the Folger, and a predoctoral fellowship at the Max-Planck-Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte in Berlin. He was awarded (but declined) an ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship for the academic year 2011-12. Dr. Witmore earned an A.B. in English at Vassar College, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley. Among his more recent projects, he launched the Working Group for Digital Inquiry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and organized the Pittsburgh Consortium for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. His publications include numerous articles, website resources, and book chapters, and he has published five books: Landscapes of the Passing Strange: Reflections from Shakespeare, with Rosamond Purcell (2010), Shakespearean Metaphysics (2009), Pretty Creatures: Children and Fiction in the English Renaissance (2007), Childhood and Children’s Books in Early Modern Europe, 1550-1800 (2006), and Culture of Accidents: Unexpected Knowledge in Early Modern England (2001). In addition, he has given scores of presentations and been invited to serve on numerous academic panels. He currently has several books in progress, including a study of early modern wisdom literature and a book on the nature of digital inquiry in the humanities. Professor Lorraine Daston (Max Planck Institute for the History of Science)Professor Daston has published on a wide range of topics in the history of science, including the history of probability and statistics, wonders in early modern science, the emergence of the scientific fact, scientific models, objects of scientific inquiry, the moral authority of nature, and the history of scientific objectivity. Recent books include (with Paul Erikson et al.) How Reason Almost Lost Its Mind: The Strange Career of Cold war Rationality (2014)  and (co-edited with Elizabeth Lunbeck), Histories of Scientific Observation (2011), both products of MPIWG Working Groups. Her current projects include a history of rules, based on her 2014 Lawrence Stone Lectures at Princeton University, the emergence of Big Science and Big Humanities in the context of nineteenth-century archives, and the relationship between moral and natural orders. She is the recipient of the Pfizer Prize and Sarton Medal of the History of Science Society, the Schelling Prize of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, the Lichtenberg Medal of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, the Luhmann Prize of the University of Bielefeld, and an honorary dotorate of humane letters from Princeton University.

Eden (Columbia University)Professor Eden began teaching at Columbia in 1980. She studies the history of rhetorical and poetic theory in antiquity, including late antiquity, and the Renaissance, within the larger context of intellectual history and with an emphasis on the problems of reception. Her books include Poetic and Legal Fiction in The Aristotelian Tradition (Princeton,1986), Hermeneutics and the Rhetorical Tradition: Chapters in the Ancient Legacy and its Humanist Reception (New Haven, 1997), and Friends Hold All Things in Common: Tradition, Intellectual Property and the 'Adages' of Erasmus (New Haven, 2001). Her articles appear in Journal of the History of Ideas, Rhetorica, Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities, Studies in the Literary Imagination, Erasmus of Rotterdam Society Yearbook and Traditio. Her current project explores epistolary theory and the construction of letter collections in antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1981-82 she received a fellowship from the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. and in 1998-99 a Guggenheim fellowship. In 1998 she won the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates and in 2001 the Mark Van Doren Award and the Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum.Professor Lorna Hutson (Merton College, University of Oxford)Professor Hutson's interests are in the relationship between literary form and the formal aspects of non-literary culture. Most recently, she has been interested in legal-literary relations (for example, in how legal techniques of proof can become, in fiction, modes of vividness). She currently holds a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship for a project entitled Shakespeare’s Scotland, which looks at Anglo-Scots literary and legal imagining in the century leading up to Shakespeare’s great tragedies. Professor Hutson has written on Thomas Nashe (1989); on gender in sixteenth century English literature, The Usurer’s Daughter: Male Friendship and Fictions of Women in Sixteenth Century England (1994); on drama and participatory justice in The Invention of Suspicion (2007), which won the Roland Bainton Prize for Literature in 2008, and on theatrical ‘unscene’ in Circumstantial Shakespeare (2015) based on the Oxford Wells Shakespeare Lectures, 2012. Edited collections include Feminism and Renaissance Studies (1999) and, with Victoria Kahn, Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe (2001). For the Cambridge Complete Works of Ben Jonson (2012), she edited Jonson’s Discoveries (1641). Forthcoming is the Oxford Handbook of English Law and Literature, 1500-1700.Frontispiece to Francis Bacon's Instauratio Magna (1620)If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

							Cybernetics as a History of the PresentAs more and more of our collective activities (education, pension planning, health management, environmental protection) are mediated by rapidly moving markets and computerized technologies, uncertainties abound.  Ours, we are told, is an information age, in which new forms of data collection and analysis will enable ever more efficient management of supply chains, regulation of energy usage and even allocation of personal time.  Such visions of a technologically mediated — and seemingly limitless — future are not new.  They echo the technological futurism popularized in the middle of the twentieth century by cybernetics.  Beginning with the 1948 publication of Norbert Wiener’s book, Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, cybernetics inaugurated path-breaking scientific explorations of feedback and self-regulation in biological and mechanical system.  In the process, it provided the conceptual foundation for contemporary advances in fields such as bioinformatics, operations research, game theory and artificial intelligence.  Our group brings together a diverse range of experts in the humanities, the social and computational sciences, law and the arts. Together we examine how emerging information models are altering experiences of social belonging and the ways in which citizens are situated within emerging projects of governance and market allocation.              Revisiting mid-century information science and its multiple offshoots offers a powerful framework for addressing the multidisciplinary questions raised by Big Data and its growing centrality to contemporary social life.  Cybernetics attracted scholars from a surprisingly wide array of disciplines, because it provided a language and method for commensurating diverse phenomena.  Mathematicians, physicists, linguists, anthropologists, psychologists and biologists, working in collaboration, made cybernetics a popular scientific reference during the 1950s and 1960s.  Their research formed a particularly American response to the challenges of the post-World War II era, combining US Cold War defense funding with support from private foundations, academic centers and emerging industry. While much of this history is well researched, our work challenges the common notion that cybernetics was merely a vogueish mid-century techno-science, which fell into obscurity by the1970s.  Instead we seek to understand more precisely how systems analysis and practices of control and regulation persisted beyond that moment, transformed by new emphases on open (as opposed to closed) systems, and on disruption and innovation (rather than homeostasis).  How does the language of optimization alter how we measure and understand human excellence in everything from teacher performance to healthcare outcomes?  What are the ethical commitments of the cybernetic sciences?  How are ideas of legal justice and human rights transformed as the limits of personhood itself come to be quantified with new precision? The opportunity to cast our net far and wide — though challenging — will allow us to think about familiar questions differently, and in dialogue with knowledge outside of our individual disciplines.Our aim is not merely to investigate the history of information theory, but to understand more precisely how the conceptual logic of our current information infrastructure has developed over the course of the last 70 years.  Cybernetics and Society will sponsor 12 fortnightly meetings throughout the academic year, four each term.  We will intersperse smaller, reading group sessions with public lectures.  Doing so gives us an opportunity to  engage with speakers' work ahead of time and will help support a more robust and lively discussion with our invited guests.   Themes will include Systems Science and Industrial Management; Histories of Modern Risk; Cybernetics and Design Thinking; Rethinking Cold War Science; Historicising the Information Age; and Cybernetics and the Psychology of Happiness. Administrative assistance: gradfac@crassh.cam.ac.ukConvenorsDr Andrew McKenzie-McHarg (Research Associate ,CRASSH)

							The call for decolonisation is resonating in universities across the globe today. The most dramatic instance has been the Rhodes Must Fall movement in South Africa, which inspired protests such as Rhodes Must Fall at Oxford and “Why is My Curriculum White” at UCL. These movements have found affinities with expanding struggles around race, gender, and class on North American campuses and with the upsurge of interest in decolonisation within professional academia.  Our workshops and seminars will focus on one particular aspect of today’s demand to decolonise the university: the curriculum. Drawing from postcolonial, decolonial, and subaltern critiques of social science knowledge production and circulation, the research group will aim to explore the “postcolonial turn” or “Southern turn” in different domains of the humanities and social sciences. The series of activities are both inspired by and in dialogue with the increasing attention to the global plurality of particular disciplines, for example, the need to work toward “a world anthropologies framework”, “global sociology”, or non-Western international relations.Our questions of decolonising knowledge in the academy are four-fold. First, why is the demand for decolonisation being heard so widely in universities today? Second, what place does decolonising the curriculum have in these broader demands for decolonising the university? Third, what are the experiences with decolonising the university curriculum in different parts of the world? Fourth, what would it mean to decolonise the curriculum in Cambridge?

							Digital technologies have shaped utopian and dystopian visions of global communication, financialisation, and surveillance, and have expanded our forms of perception. These developments have not only captured the imagination of artists, but also motivated them to become agents in the digitized world. Working across video and online platforms, digital artists have critically commented on themes such as privacy, civil liberties, cultural ownership, the economy and individual agency; at the same time, many have themselves become forerunners in the fields of science, technology, and activism. These practices have often had an impact outside the artistic sphere, cutting across disciplinary and institutional boundaries.The focus of this research group is therefore to investigate the role that digital art can play in helping us to understand, critique, and shape the impact of digital technologies on contemporary society. What, if anything, makes the practices in question recognisably artistic? How are established aesthetic concepts challenged when, for example, the work of financial activists is exhibited at contemporary art biennales, or when human rights tribunals rely on digital image analysis provided by architects and filmmakers? This group’s interest in the relationship between digital art and the spheres of science, technology and aesthetics will allow us to deepen our understanding of these processes via situated case studies, and to do so within an interdisciplinary context. Each term will be organised around two invited talks and two reading sessions.
Michaelmas Term 2017: Digital Art and FinancialisationThroughout this term, we aim to consider digital art’s important and dynamic role in documenting, rethinking, and opposing digital financial technologies. Such practices range from video works shown in a gallery context (Hito Steyerl, Andrew Norman Wilson, Olia Lialina) to grassroots participatory projects (Robin Hood Co-Operative). In interrogating the status of artworks which take global finance as both theme and medium, we also aim to reflect upon the aesthetic and ethical implications of artistic practices embedded in digital technologies.

Lent Term 2018: Digital Art and SurveillanceWhile the digitalization of surveillance has become pervasive in contemporary societies, it has also given rise to new loopholes, potential failure, and sites of invisibility. This phenomenon will be our focus during Lent Term, during which we will look at how artists have both used surveillance technologies and exposed their potential perils. Our reading sessions will seek to analyse new forms of artistic agency, mediation, and subjectivity fostered by a post-Foucauldian model of government (‘super-panopticon’). Administrative assistance: gradfac@crassh.cam.ac.ukConvenorsDr Aline Guillermet  (JRF, King’s College, Visual Culture, History of Art)

We are a network of researchers at Cambridge who are interested in how the use of digital tools is transforming scholarship in the humanities and social sciences. This transformation spans both the content and practice of humanities research, as the diffusion of digital technologies opens up new fields of study and generates research questions which breach traditional disciplinary boundaries.We are now working towards the development of Cambridge Digital Humanities, which will bring together the DH research community with colleagues from the University Library and UIS to provide a greater level of support for DH research at Cambridge.We organise an extensive Digital Methods programme which runs throughout the year hosted by CRASSH and in other venues across the University.Find out more on our website www.digitalhumanities.cam.ac.uk or contact Dr Anne Alexander. Michaelmas Term 2017Tuesday 17 October 2017

Beyond Words: Workshop 1 (Mapping the Conceptual Terrain)Cambridge Digital Humanities and Cambridge Digital History with the support of the Researcher Development Programme and AHRC DTP

Machine Reading the Archive brings together humanities and social science researchers, archivists and computer scientists to explore the challenges of working with archives in the digital age. Through a mentoring scheme supporting digital archive projects and a series of practical workshops, technical demonstrations, field trips and a one day end-of-programme showcase, we hope to seed new collaborations and encourage the exchange of ideas and practices across professions and disciplines.

Registered participants must be PhD students or staff at the University and Colleges of Cambridge.

There are two ways to take part in the programme – through our group sessions and workshops, and by applying for a place on our Projects track.

Machine Reading the Archive Projects provides PhD students and staff at the University of Cambridge individual mentoring and support in developing a digital archives project.
Selected participants for MRtA Projects will be offered 4 x 1 hour individual/paired mentoring sessions with our Digital Methods Fellows, Dr Gabe Recchia and Dr Paul Nulty and 1 x 1 hour individual session on collaboration, networking and funding opportunities with Dr Anne Alexander, Cambridge Digital Humanities Network Coordinator. The sessions will be arranged at mutually convenient times between December 2017 and June 2018. Successful applicants will also be expected to give a short presentation about their project at the end-of-programme workshop in June 2018.

Participants in MRtA Projects are strongly encouraged to attend Machine Reading the Archive group sessions and other relevant digital methods training sessions and workshops.
Applications for MRtA Projects are open from 18 October to 12 noon on 20 November.
Registration for the MRtA programme group sessions is open throughout the academic year.

								Seminar room SG2, Alison Richard Building, CRASSH
							Food gives life. It provides energy, strengthens social bonds and enriches culture worldwide. Our collective hunger has remodelled the globe. We have flattened forests, emptied seas and developed an incredible range of technologies to satisfy our collective appetite. Parts of the world have unrestricted access to nutritious food, but many regions are in desperate need of calories or micronutrients. Millions suffer and die from an excess of food while millions suffer and die from a lack of it.

This research group examines multiple aspects of the global food system, following food across academic boundaries from field to table. We cover the collective impact of technological innovations, market forces and human behaviour on global food security. Our aim is to explore how much optimisation can take place within the traditional architecture of our food system and explore the potential of emerging alternative food systems to provide solutions.

Food has the power to help billions, provoke conflict and make or break the economies of entire continents. By bringing together early career researchers from across the University for a seminar series and focussed reading group, we hope to stimulate wide discussion on some of the core questions faced in securing our global food future.

2014–2019
CRASSH, University of CambridgeWhat existed in the European imagination before the Romantic concept of ‘genius’?This five-year ERC-funded research project, led by Dr Alexander Marr, Department of History of Art, will examine notions of unique talent, heightened imagination and extraordinary creativity in art and science by exploring the language, theories, practices and products of ingenium (ingenuity) ca. 1450–ca. 1750. Drawing on the perspectives of history of art, history of science, technology and medicine, intellectual history and literary studies, the project seeks to capture ingenuity across and between disciplines.  Studying six countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, England and Spain) across three centuries, it will trace ingenuity’s shifting patterns and fragmented fortunes over the longue durée. Research will be conducted in four strands, focused on distinctive but interrelated aspects of ingenuity:This project is based at CRASSH, which also co-hosts jointly with English, the ERC project Crossroads of Knowledge in Early Modern England: the Place of Literature. For further information please contact genius@crassh.cam.ac.uk. Funded by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ ERC grant agreement no 617391.Principal InvestigatorDr Alexander Marr (History of Art, University of Cambridge)Senior Research InvestigatorDr Richard Serjeantson (History, University of Cambridge) until December 2016Senior ResearcherDr Timothy Chesters (MML, University of Cambridge) from October 2016Post-doctoral Research AssociatesDr Raphaële Garrod

By studying translators and their practices she tries to analyse the role and function of translation as a form of circulation of knowledge. Textual translations from Latin to the vernaculars and vice versa are often understood as attempts to reach out to a wider readership. However, personal notebooks and marginal annotations in manuscript and printed books also seem to point towards mnemonic reasons for translating texts. Along the same line of this personal comprehension, she also looks at visualisations of scientific knowledge in manuscripts and printed books - from list and diagrams to actual images. This visual material often seems to have a role in the author’s understanding, memorizing and application of the information in the text.Doctoral Student David Zagoury (Cambridge Trust Scholar, Queens' College, email dz276@cam.ac.uk) David's doctoral project explores the faculty of imagination in the intellectual culture of sixteenth-century Italian artists. In particular, he is examining the notion of 'fantasia' in the writings of artists and critics from Leonardo onwards, accounting for the sources and the nature of their conception of imagination. He is also investigating the iconography and visual representation of creativity and fantasy during the period.2014–2015Dr Ita Mac Carthy (University of Birmingham)Dr Mac Carthy is Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham and specializes in Italian Renaissance literature and art. She focuses, in particular, on the connections between visual and verbal culture, on questions of literary genre and aesthetic practice and on women’s studies. She is the author of Women and the Making of Poetry in Ludovico Ariosto’s Orlando furioso (2007) and is currently writing The Grace of the Italian Renaissance, a book that explores the rise to prominence of the keyword ‘grazia’ in early modern Italian society, literature and art. This interest in grazia is part of a broader concern with the keywords that early modern Europeans lived by, and in this vein, she has edited the volume Renaissance Keywords (2013) and co-directs with Dr Richard Scholar a research group, ‘Early Modern Keywords’, whose aim is to compile and explore a European vocabulary of culture and society of the period 1450-1700.Dr Richard Scholar (Oriel College, University of Oxford)Dr Scholar's main research interests lie in early modern French literature and thought, comparative and interdisciplinary early modern studies, and questions of critical method and theory. He is the author of two books: Montaigne and the Art of Free-Thinking (2010) and The Je-Ne-Sais-Quoi in Early Modern Europe: Encounters with a Certain Something (2005). His work is principally concerned with the keywords, linguistic structures, and literary forms that enabled early modern writers to test the limits of thought and expression in the period and that thus reveal fundamental features of early modern learning, culture, and society. Dr Scholar is currently working on a major reevaluation of Thomas More’s Utopia and its afterlives in European literature and thought and is a member of the ANR-funded research collective Disputes, Controversies and Querelles (with Paris IV-Sorbonne) and a co-director of Early Modern Keywords, a research group that is compiling and exploring a European vocabulary of culture and society of the period 1450–1700, in the wake of Renaissance Keywords (2013). From 2008–12, he led a four-year collaborative research project entitled 'Francophone Caribbean Writing in Context', which included a Leverhulme International Research Network on the topic of ‘Caribbean Globalizations’.2015-2016Dr Guido Giglioni (Warburg Institute, London)Dr Giglioni teaches Renaissance Latin and philosophy at the Warburg Institute. His research deals with early modern ideas of life and imagination, and their relationships with both matter and knowledge. He studied philosophy at the University of Macerata, Italy, and graduated in history of science and medicine at the Johns Hopkins University in 2002 with a PhD dissertation on Francis Glisson, a seventeenth-century English anatomist who also engaged in philosophical inquiries on the nature of life. In his treatise on substance and its energy (De natura substantiae energetica, 1672), Glisson laid the foundations for the modern notion of irritability, described as an original property of matter. As Francis Bacon is one of the main sources in Glisson’s work, on both a medical and philosophical level, in the past few years, Giglioni has been carrying out a wide-ranging research to trace the Baconian roots of early modern ideas of matter and life (from Telesio to Lamarck). An integral part of Giglioni’s research programme is a comprehensive study of the imagination, as this faculty played a key role in explaining the vital processes of embodiment and ensoulment, both below and beyond the level of the representative powers (i.e., the senses and the intellect).Dr Marisa Bass (Washington University in St. Louis)Dr Bass is Assistant Professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a specialist in the art of the Netherlands from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries. Her research interests include intersections between art and intellectual culture, the visual impact of the Reformation, and Renaissance notions of imagination and invention. Her publications include articles in the Journal of the Warburg & Courtauld Institutes and Simiolus and an essay on Hieronymus Bosch's "ingenium" in her forthcoming exhibition catalogue Beyond Bosch: The Afterlife of a Renaissance Master in Print (St. Louis Art Museum, April 2015). Her first book The Embodied Past: Jan Gossart and the Invention of Netherlandish Antiquity, is currently under review, and she is in the midst of completing the manuscript of her next book Encrypted Knowledge: The Art of Joris Hoefnagel in the Wake of the Dutch Revolt, which will be the topic of her research at CRASSH.Professor Claudia Swan (Northwestern University)Dr Swan is  Associate Professor in the Department of Art History at Northwestern University. Her research interests include early modern (16th- and 17th-century) Dutch and Flemish art; art and science; early modern transcultural exchange of art and material culture; print culture; history of collecting and museology; history of the imagination; art historiography and critical traditions of art history. Dr Swan's recent publications include “Exotica on the Move: Birds of Paradise in Early Modern Holland,” in special issue, Art History, Early Modern Objects in Motion, ed. Daniela Bleichmar and Meredith Martin, forthcoming 2015; “Conceptions, Chimeras, Counterfeits: Early Modern Theories of the Imagination and the Work of Art” in Vision and its Instruments, c. 1350–1750: The Art of Seeing and Seeing as an Art, ed. Alina Payne, forthcoming, The Pennsylvania State University Press; “Lost in Translation: Exoticism in Early Modern Holland,” in Art in Iran and Europe in the 17th Century: Exchange and Reception, edited by Axel Langer (Museum Rietberg, Zurich, CH, 2013), 100–116; “Birds of Paradise for the Sultan: Early Seventeenth-Century Dutch–Turkish Encounters and the Uses of Wonder,” De Zeventiende Eeuw 29 (2013), 49–63.2016-2017Professor Peter Stallybrass (University of Pennsylvania)Professor Stallybrass is Annenberg Professor in the Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania, where he has directed the History of Material Texts seminar since 1993. Peter has been awarded the Andrew Lang Gold Medal from the University of St. Andrews and four teaching awards from Penn. He was the Samuel Wannamaker Fellow at the Globe Theatre in London, the Moses Aaron Dropsie Fellow at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, and he is a member of the American Philosophical Society. He has collaborated with Jim Green on curating exhibitions on “Material Texts” and on Benjamin Franklin at the Library Company and the Grolier Club, and on the book Benjamin Franklin, Writer and Printer (2006). With Heather Wolfe, he curated the exhibition on “Technologies of Writing in the Renaissance” at the Folger Shakespeare Library. Stallybrass’s work focuses on early modern printing and manuscripts and he is at present turning his Rosenbach Lectures in Bibliography on “Printing for Manuscript” into a book to be published by the University of Pennsylvania Press.Prof. Dr. Sven Dupré (Utrecht University)Prof, Dr.  Dupré is Professor and Chair of History of Art, Science and Technology at Utrecht University, and Professor of History of Art, Science and Technology at the University of Amsterdam. He is the Scientific Director of the project ‘Technique in the Arts: Concepts, Practices, Expertise, 1500-1950’, supported by a European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant.  Previously he was Professor of History of Knowledge at the Freie Universität and Director of the Research Group ‘Art and Knowledge in Premodern Europe’ at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In Spring 2015 he was Robert H. Smith Scholar in Residence for Renaissance Sculpture in Context at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He is a member of the Descartes Centre for the History and Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities at Utrecht University, co-directing (with Wijnand Mijnhardt) the project “Creating a Knowledge Society in a Globalizing World, 1450-1800” in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS). He is actively involved in research in technical art history at the Ateliergebouw (Netherlands Institute for Conservation, Art and Science - NICAS) in Amsterdam, where the Rijksmuseum, the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands and the University of Amsterdam combine their knowledge in the field of restoration and preservation of art objects.Professor Pamela H. Smith (Columbia University)Professor Smith  specializes in early modern European history and the history of science. Her current research focuses on attitudes to nature in early modern Europe and the Scientific Revolution, with particular attention to craft knowledge and historical techniques.  She is founding director of the Making and Knowing Project, founding director of the Center for Science and Society  and chair of the Presidential Scholars in Society and Neuroscience. The Making and Knowing Project involved Professor Smith  and her team  working on a Research and Pedagogical Initiative to produce a digital critical edition and English translation of a remarkable sixteenth-century French manuscript. The manuscript contains a huge variety of recipes and instructions for technical procedures, especially casting, moldmaking and metalworking experiments. These recipes form the basis for the work of PhD students and visiting expert makers in the Making and Knowing Laboratory.2017–2018Professor Eileen Reeves (Princeton University)Professor Reeves is Professor and Chair of Comparative Literature and an Associate Member of the Program in the History of Science at Princeton University.  She took her Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Stanford.  She works at the intersection of early modern literary studies, the history of art, and the history of science.  Much of her research has focused on the figure of Galileo Galilei and his relationship to astronomy, religion, optics, art, and a range of literary forms, including the scientific treatise and dialogue, poetry, dialect literature, journalism, and drama.  She is currently at work on a book about early modern color, which explores the complex emergence of chromatic theory, the sometime interest of painters in this philosophical project, the non-naturalistic deployment of color, and the improbably high incidence of lost, stolen, or censored treatises on color.  Other recent or ongoing projects include essays on the relationships between optical and musical instruments, between astrology and literature, and between the new sciences and the visual arts. Previous eventsWord Histories of Ingenuity in Early Modernity, 29 - 30 May 2015Ingenuity and Imagination in Early Modern Northern Art and Theory, 21 - 22 January 2016A Public Conversation about the History of Genius, 2 March 2016Descartes and Ingenium, 14 - 15 March 2016Ingenium and Imagination in the Renaissance: Diseases, Demons and Dreams, 18 May 2016Epistemic Images in Early Modern Germany and its Neighbours,  10 - 11 November 2016Shakespeare's Desk: Public Lecture by Peter Stallybrass,  18 November 2016Scribal Ingenuity in Early Modern Europe, 16 November 2016Ingenuity in the Making, 10-12 May 2017 including A Public Lecture: Ingenious Failure: Artisanal Languages of Error - Sven DupréAmerica in the Making of Early Modern Ingenuity 30 June 2017Wit and Wordplay:  Verbal Ingenuity and the Making of Literature in Early Modern Europe, 26 September 2017 - 27 September 2017Five Shades of Gray: Galileo, Goltzius, and Astronomical Engraving (public lecture)  1 November 2017Epistemic Images: A Workshop, 6 November 2017The Fall of Icarus, Francesco Allegrini © Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge If you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

Science operates on a global stage, but this is not a recent phenomenon. Our research group explores the relationship between global history and science studies. Science here is broadly construed. Histories of natural knowledge, technology and medicine all fall under the remit of this group. By adopting this approach we look to invite discussion on the relationship between the politics of globalisation and the making of the very category of ‘science’. What counts as science is precisely the product of a series of uneven historical encounters. Often the transit of scientific material, from books to barometers, relied on the lopsided development of colonialism and global capitalism. We therefore hope to trace, not only the movement of science across borders, but also the limits of the apparent globalisation of scientific knowledge.

In 2014-2015 we bring together speakers from history, geography and anthropology. By drawing on academics from across disciplines, we offer a new base for the growing network of academics working on global histories of science.

The Charles Wallace India Trust fellowship at CRASSH offers funding for a term of study and residence in Cambridge during the academic year.  The scheme is intended for earlier-career academics from India (defined as resident and domiciled in India, normally between the ages of 25 and 45 years). Applicants should have been in full-time academic employment in an Indian university or research institute of equivalent standing for at least five years and have completed a PhD. For further information about the Fellowship and Fellows please click here. The competition to select a Fellow for 2018-19 has now closed. Quentin Skinner Fellowship (previously known as the Balzan-Skinner Fellowship) (one term)
In 2009 the Faculty of History  received funding  from the International Balzan Prize Foundation to establish an annual Lecture in modern intellectual history since c. 1500. Since then there have been six Balzan-Skinner Fellows at CRASSH. In 2015-16 this Fellowship came to an end and is now known as the Quentin-Skinner Fellowship in Intellectual History since c15.00. The appointed Fellow holds a fellowship at CRASSH for one term, presenting the Quentin-Skinner lecture and participating in the related symposium. For information about the Quentin Skinner Fellowship and previous Balzan-Skinner Fellows please click here. The Quentin Skinner Fellowship  is intended for early career scholars (normally defined as within ten years of attaining the PhD). Like  previous Balzan-Skinner Fellows, the Quentin Skinner Fellow will be invited to give a lecture on a subject of their choosing in the broad field of intellectual history since 1500, including the history of political thought, and will organise a half-day colloquium to follow the lecture. The competition for 2018-19 is now closed. Charles Wallace India Trust Fellow

2015–2018
CRASSH, University of CambridgeThis project explores one of the most pressing sets of questions for modern social science and its relation to policy. What are the effects on a system of social policy when numerical quantification and evaluation is introduced into that system? How does the use of numerical evaluation exclude, trivialize or distort other systems of political, moral and social evaluation? What are the political and moral consequences of this shift towards numerical evaluation? These questions are addressed with respect to three distinct strands of social policy — education, climate change and healthcare — three areas where social science, policy and the gritty world of politics interact with intense urgency. International and interdisciplinary in its conception, each strand of the research will be conducted by a team from a different major research university — Chicago, Cambridge, Santa Barbara California. The Cambridge project will focus on healthcare, looking at the role of numerical quantification in the British National Health Service (NHS). In healthcare the UK has led the world in basing the allocation of scarce resources on quantitative economic models. From its inception, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has assessed novel interventions in terms of Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs). QALYs are now the prime means of evaluating decisions about resource allocation, yet there is no scholarly history of their introduction, nor any detailed account of their effects on the processes of healthcare. How did the dominance of QALYs come about? What effect does the use of QALYs have on the behaviour of actors within the hospital system? Furthermore, what are the philosophical underpinnings, implications and limitations of the use of QALYs as a method of evaluation? This strand of the project will address these questions using a unique range of interdisciplinary approaches in order to produce a fully articulated account of both the historical and anthropological details and the wider social policy implications of numerical quantification within the NHS.Project DescriptionThe Limits of the Numerical project is funded jointly by the ISRF and the Isaac Newton Trust. Research Team in Cambridge (Healthcare)Dr Stephen John (HPS, University of Cambridge)

2015–2019
CRASSH, University of CambridgeHow and when did science become visual? How did drawings, diagrams and charts come to be used alongside words and objects by a group of people who hoped to reform and establish a new form of knowledge of nature, based on collaboration, experimentation and observation in the second half of the century? Who made those drawings and diagrams, and what made them ‘scientific’?  The aim of this project is to understand the roles visual resources and practices played in the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge in the first fifty years of the Royal Society. As one of the earliest institutions dedicated to collective investigation of nature, the Royal Society had few precedents to follow, and faced challenges in forming and presenting a new kind of collaborative knowledge to its audience. Many of the publications sponsored by the Royal Society such as Robert Hooke’s Micrographia or Francis Willughby’s Historia piscium, as well as the institution’s journal, 'Philosophical Transactions', contained extensive illustrations. These were important projects, as the Society grappled with various strategies to present a new form of knowledge and establish its own authority in scientific matters.  The archives of the Society contain a rich variety of images that has not yet received much attention by historians of science. This project proposes to undertake a systematic investigation into the visual and graphic practices of the Royal Society during its first fifty years, and examine the roles the Society played in the emergence of a scientific visual culture in the early modern period.

							Open Intellectual Property Models of Emerging Technologies and Implications for the Equitable Society
 The guiding question of our research group will be the extent to which open technologies result in equitable sharing of knowledge and cognitive or technology justice. 'Open' IP describes a range of approaches to knowledge production, distribution and consumption that allow more or different actors to participate in producing and benefit from technologies. The global shift to knowledge-based economies and increasingly rapid pace of technological advancement means that the question of how society deals with intellectual property (IP) and structures institutions and communities to manage and disseminate knowledge is critically important to our future. Our choices will reflect and shape our societal values, practices and culture. Advocates of open and collaborative approaches point to evidence of real social impact from but there is little published evidence and any effects are heavily context dependent. 
We are interested in emerging technologies such as synthetic biology, artificial intelligence and electric cars; new networked infrastructure such as distributed energy and new forms of manufacturing such as 3D-printing. Examples of open technologies are found within each of these sectors, situated along a spectrum from fully public domain to forming part of a managed commons. Our research group has a range of interests from biotechnologies and diagnostics; 'green' technology and sustainability transitions; governance of risk through to knowledge and technology transfer for international development. We will explore together the legal issues, economic implications and governance of open technologies across key sectors, asking how they are established, what motivates the IP owners and ultimately what impact this might have on societies. This will enable us to push the boundaries of our current knowledge and understanding, cross-fertilising between our respective fields and creating new interdisciplinary insights and novel research ideas. Administrative assistance: gradfac@crassh.cam.ac.ukConvenorsJenny Molloy (Coordinator, Synthetic Biology SRI and OpenPlant, Department of Plant Sciences)

							Beyond Boundaries: Thinking as/through PerformanceInterest in Performance reflects a movement away from thinking in terms of immutable objects and singular subjects. It focuses attention instead on collective contexts. It offers an umbrella approach with which to interrogate a given phenomenon (both individual and collective). Thinking as/through Performance proposes a different way to mean – a 'kind of thinking in its own right' (Cull/Minors 2012) – which performances, theatricality, theatre, and the arts in practice can also model. A few questions that frame our thinking are:What does it mean to frame, stage, display or enact? In what sense might all forms of self-consciously public statements – art, politics, academic discourse – be seen as performance?
How is our post-print digital era, with its forces of equivalence and convergence, prompting reconsideration of traditional categories and boundaries – i.e. of the disciplinary itself?
How do we understand objects (fixed, a record) when they cannot exist separately from their experience on the part of somebody or other (time-bound, embodied)?
How do we understand the subject when it depends on imagined and actual collectivities to position itself?Each session is flexibly organised around two short presentations from different disciplinary backgrounds, followed by extended discussion. We also regularly host workshops, performances and panel discussions in collaboration with creative practitioners. CIPN aims to provide a platform for discursive encounters that foster greater dialogue between the academy and creative practice more generally. After a first introductory year (2013-14), the Cambridge Interdisciplinary Performance Network (CIPN) has programmed seminars with a slight emphasis on current debates in Anthropology (2014-15), Art History (2015-16), English (2016-17). This year we turn to Theology and Philosophy to explore questions surrounding the nature of being and the complex interrelationship between the material and immaterial, and how these relationships are enacted daily in the performance of place, through the roles of ritual and tradition, and by the affective powers of music, art and memory. Please feel free to get in touch with the seminar convenors:  Rozelle Bosch, Rachel Stroud or  Clare Foster  for further information.

Rin Ushiyama (Department of Sociology) -Clare Foster (Creative Writing, Classics) was a screenwriter based in Los Angeles from 1990-2008, before returning to England to take the MA in Classical Reception Studies at UCL. She just completed an AHRC-funded Phd at Cambridge about Greek drama, theatre history, and the performance of tradition. She is now a British Academy Post-Doctoral Fellow at UCL (2015-18), looking at the history of current attitudes to ‘adaptation’.
  Jonas Tinius (Division of Social Anthropology) is a PhD candidate working on contemporary artistic institutions in Germany with a focus on public theatres. He is editor of Anthropology, Theatre, and Performance: The Transformative Potential of Performance (with Alex Flynn, Palgrave 2015). 
 
Michael Byrne (CMPCP, Faculty of Music) is a PhD candidate exploring creativity and ageing in the narrative works of The Royal Ballet. Using the reconstruction of Helpmann's Miracle in the Gorbals as a central case study, his research analyses the embodied histories of senior dancers and the intergenerational transmission of knowledge in performance. 


Neylan Bagcioglu (History of Art) is a PhD candidate working on radical and collaborative art practices in Britain during the 1970s, with a special focus on the politics of the artist project. She has been published in the Turkish newspapers Hürriyet and Radikal as an art critic, and has worked for organisations including Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts (IKSV), Istanbul Modern Museum and Apple Inc. Rachel Stroud (Faculty of Music) is a PhD candidate working on notation and performance in Beethoven's late string quartets, conceiving of the notation not as a codification of the composer's intentions, but as a social artefact. Other research interests include issues of sociality in ensemble playing, such as performing without a conductor. Rachel is also a professional baroque violinist and has performed all over the world in countries ranging from Latvia to Argentina, specialising in particular in the performance of early-nineteenth century repertoire on historical instruments.  Rin Ushiyama (Department of Sociology) is a PhD candidate working on cultural sociology, collective memory and social performance, with a specific focus on contemporary Japan. His dissertation examines how the Aum Affair, a series of crimes and terrorist attacks committed by the religious movement Aum Shinrikyo in the early 1990s, has been remembered and commemorated. 
Jack Belloli (English) is a PhD candidate looking at the relationship between philosophical constructions of skill and experimental theatre practice since Beckett. He also co-convenes the AHRC-funded Materials in Practice reading group, and has wider research interests in how theories of practice and self-fashioning might inform contemporary Anglophone writing in less apparently “performative” genres.  Rozelle Bosch is a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Divinity who is working on an ontology of the flesh. An investigation which seeks to understand how Dante's Divine Comedy and Catherine of Siena's writings are central to what she calls "incarnational performances". Her research interests range from topics relating to gender theory, everyday performances wherein gesture, sign and symbols are instrumental and the question as to how everyday existence can be "incarnational".
 Yesim Yaprak Yildiz is a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology working on public confessions of state officials on past atrocities with a focus on Turkey. As part of her research, she is looking into performance and performativity in public confessions. Her research interests include transitional justice, political violence, human rights and politics of memory. ---Faculty AdvisorsDr Joel Chalfen (Lecturer in Drama, Faculty of Education)

							The promise of mechanical and digital visual technologies is often assumed to originate in their ability to render the invisible visible, hence contributing to the wider de-mystification constitutive of modernity. This Seminar will approach a key technology in this respect, photography, from an angle that seeks to explore the extent to which it (and by extension other similar technologies) is also involved in a far more nuanced and complex epistemological and ontological operation of transforming the invisible into the "unseen", in the sense of deepened marking of human consciousness by the felt consequential and unsettling presence of something out of view. Recent literature on photographic techniques and practices, ranging from visual studies, history, anthropology, and science and technology studies have illuminated ways in which the symbolic and epistemic efficacy of photography derives not simply from its power of revealing what is hidden in the world, but equally from configuring a series of phenomena, events or forms as lying "at the edge of sight" (Smith 2013). Hence, at the same time as it stabilizes vision by showing what was hitherto imperceptible, photography also amplifies the experience of "imperceptibility" itself, by revealing human interaction with the world to be structured around irreducible visual blind spots. The Seminar will bring together scholars from diverse disciplines who are in various ways exploring this dialectic of the simultaneous stabilization of vision and expansion of the unseen, and who are documenting how photography's generative suspension between invisibility and the unseen shapes different "fields of vision" in the contemporary world. Focused on aesthetic, affective, semantic, evidential, and political aspects of the topic and their entanglements, the Seminar will foster critical, interdisciplinary approaches and dialogue on a key theoretical area of photography studies today. Administrative assistance: gradfac@crassh.cam.ac.ukConvenorsDr Christos Lynteris (Senior Research Associate/ ERC Principal Investigator CRASSH)

							This interdisciplinary research group seeks to address the disconnect between popular and academic critique of the way contemporary political crisis is covered in mainstream media. We assert that there is a dearth of pragmatic, accessible discussions about how images work, rather than what they purportedly show. As fake news and multimedia increasingly suffuse the visual landscape, it is imperative to initiate an academic and public discussion about how what we see, and the way it is contextualised, underpins popular claims about how contemporary political power operates. We ask: can academics, artists, and visual practitioners help us all better understand how political issues are imagined and imaged? In order to achieve this aim, the group will organise a series of reading groups, seminars, film screenings, master classes, and practice-based events focused on dissecting the camera as a political technology of power. Michaelmas Term 2017: The Technological History of Visualising Politics The events of this term will focus on how devices of imaging political crisis have given rise to popular interpretations of conflict. We will explore the technological history of the camera, from the genesis of mainstream photojournalism and film in the 19th century to the contemporary widespread usage of drone imaging. There will also be space to discuss how the aesthetics of data, and visualisation of facts, has historically emerged from assumptions about the objective powers of observational technologies.Lent  Term 2018: Technologies of Seeing OthersWe will focus on how images are used to make claims about difference, both across cultural divides and across the perceived boundary between the human and non-human. The conceptual lynchpin of this term’s events will be the technological production of alterity, and how images serve to both underscore and cast into doubt what might otherwise be interpreted as clear-cut boundaries of cultural, political, and racial difference. Administrative assistance: gradfac@crassh.cam.ac.ukNatalie Camille Morningstar  (PhD in Social Anthropology)

One of the most pressing contemporary problems not just for the academic community but also – and more disturbingly – for the political order of the world is how to understand and respond to the current toxic combination of religion and politics. It is a fundamental concern on the one hand for the issue of diversity. How should the liberal ideal of a tolerant and mixed society comprehend claims to exclusive and totalizing visions of truth, which set themselves against such liberal ideals? We may recognize that there is now, nationally and globally, a new and complex map, which has more than one monotheism, and polytheism, competing alongside secular standpoints. The challenge, in brief, may be expressed like this: how can we take account of theological difference without going to war for belief? Quite simply, diversity in modern society cannot be adequately broached without an engagement with religion. It is, on the other hand, an equally if differently problematic arena of conflict for universities and other institutions of education. Current attempts at legislation in Britain and elsewhere (e.g. Britain’s 2015 “Prevent” strategy) demonstrate little but bafflement, and consequently a profoundly incoherent response to the vexing issues of how teaching and other university practices should engage with the raft of interests unhelpfully sloganized as fundamentalism. The modern secular university – itself the result of a long and contested development – in part because of its very history, has left religion in a systematically awkward and often vexed space on campus, for all participants: teachers, students, administrators.  This project aims to approach these problems from a new direction and with new methods of engagement. It will place the dialogic dynamics of religious interaction at the heart of a series of interlinked workshops, summer schools and seminars, to explore how the university can explore the issue of religious diversity in the most sophisticated, historically grounded and productive manner.

The past several decades have witnessed an explosion of interest in the study of visual and material culture. Visual studies has challenged existing methodologies and disciplinary structures, while developing new methods to analyse processes of looking and being viewed. Likewise, material-culture studies has placed ‘things’ centre-stage in subjects from which they were previously absent and fashioned sophisticated means for researching objects in society and culture. The two fields have much in common: capacious interdisciplinarity, the rupturing of the canon, nontraditional objects of study, and a bespoke methodological toolkit. Yet they are rarely brought together in meaningful dialogue, their practitioners remain dispersed, and the benefits of their alignment remain unrealised. Our first intellectual aim is to develop a framework in which to realise this potential.

Visual and material culture changed rapidly in the early modern period thanks to dramatic social and economic upheaval, radical technological advances, the expansion of global networks of exchange, and significant shifts in philosophical and political thinking. The programme will support advanced research into how, why, and to what effect these changes occurred. By looking back to a period when the assumed categories of modern social order, intellectual disciplines and habits of thought are not yet firmly established, we will be able to see more clearly our contemporary stake in understanding the cultural world through what we see and what we consume.

Seeing Things will provide an interdisciplinary research environment in which innovative scholarship may be undertaken, in which methodologies will be debated and reconfigured, and in which the parameters of a new, integrated field may be staked out.  In particular, it will encourage collaboration between scholars at the participating institutions, visiting fellows, and researchers at different career stages.  Dr Alexander MarrDr Mary Laven

And just as they had no idea of the ways in which that technology would shape the world for the next 400 years, we are likewise largely in the dark about what the digital future holds.The goal of this philanthropically-supported project  — which is led by John Naughton and David Runciman — is to explore the implications of digital technology for society.  Questions in which we are interested include:The Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge (CCDK) constitutes an ambitious response to the current state of digital knowledge, in a form that enables swift, scalable and dynamic response to rapidly changing intellectual, cultural and technological conditions.The premise of CCDK is that we are now entering the third phase of Digital Humanities. The first phase prioritized the digitization of analogue materials. The second phase involved the growth of a digital humanities discipline, which has promoted new working practices in the humanities and social sciences. One result of these two phases has been the facilitation and increased speed of access to data. The third phase now urgently requires new forms of understanding that will use new technologies to transcend rather than perpetuate well-worn approaches in the humanities and social sciences. The CCDK is structured around two strands of research which represent the two most pressing concerns of digital humanities: Digital Epistemology and Digital Society.The Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge comprises of the Technology and Democracy project, the Concept Lab and the Digital Society project.Project LeadersProfessor David Runciman (POLIS, University of Cambridge)

It is committed to the view that concepts are not equivalent to the meanings of the words which express them. The Lab considers conceptual architectures as generating structured environments for sensing that one has arrived at understanding. Through computational methodologies it seeks to describe and analyse these structured environments which have both internal and external manifestations. With respect to the internal structure of concepts we aim to characterise not only form and function but also modalities and other attributes of conceptual entities. In the case of external features we seek to uncover the conceptual networks within which concepts circulate. In both cases the Lab develops data driven accounts of these structures and networks derived from large scale corpora.The Concept Lab aims to generate a substantial repository of data that will allow us to understand better how concepts work. Although our primary focus is on the cultural expression and manifestation of conceptual forms, deriving our data from the written record of linguistic usage, we intend our work to contribute to the understanding of concepts in the widest sense. Thus, although the Lab does not engage in experimental methodologies for exposing cognitive behaviours and does not, correspondingly, seek to explain how human agents possess concepts it does regard its work as complementary to such studies.A second strand of work concerns the historical extension of conceptual forms. This aspect of our project seeks to identify where, how and why concepts change or emerge over time. To this end it is engaged in the production of a number of case studies that explore both the computational methodologies that are continuously revised by the Lab and the histories of words, concepts and usages that heretofore have provided the common currency of the history of ideas.The Lab has a North American counterpart working in tandem with the Cambridge group. The four researchers in Cambridge – Peter de Bolla, Paul Nulty, Gabriel Recchia and John Regan – regularly meet remotely with the four researchers in North America – Clifford Siskin, Mark Algee-Hewitt, Bill Blake and Yohei Igarashi. The entire group has a yearly workshop that meets either in Cambridge or North America.The work of the Lab is intended to contribute to two larger projects. One, the Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge based in CRASSH, seeks to further our understanding of how new knowledge is produced in the digital domain. The second, the Re: Enlightement Project, seeks to promote innovative means for creating new knowledge.The Concept Lab CambridgeDirector Professor Peter de Bolla (English, University of Cambridge)Research AssociatesDr Paul Nulty

 The Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge (CCDK) constitutes an ambitious response to the current state of digital knowledge, in a form that enables swift, scalable and dynamic response to rapidly changing intellectual, cultural and technological conditions.The premise of CCDK is that we are now entering the third phase of Digital Humanities. The first phase prioritized the digitization of analogue materials. The second phase involved the growth of a digital humanities discipline, which has promoted new working practices in the humanities and social sciences. One result of these two phases has been the facilitation and increased speed of access to data. The third phase now urgently requires new forms of understanding that will use new technologies to transcend rather than perpetuate well-worn approaches in the humanities and social sciences. The CCDK is structured around two strands of research which represent the two most pressing concerns of digital humanities: Digital Epistemology and Digital Society.The Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge comprises of the Technology and Democracy project, the Concept Lab and the Digital Society project.© Amber Case, Flickr CommonsIf you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

The aim of this project is to compare the comparative cultures of different periods and to reconsider the specificities of modern comparative approaches within the variety of comparative moments. Four moments will be investigated through papers on themes  and key individual authors: the comparatisms of ancient Greece, 17th century Humanism, 19th century England, and post-modern approaches. The great variety  of comparative approaches found in each moment will provide plenty of opportunity for original investigations into particulars and details, and even more material for the systematic, comparative assessment of the cultures they embody.Two sets of interrelated questions will run through the entire seminar.  1) The interaction of religion, power, and translation at play in the classifications of cultural comparison. So, how do the different areas of comparison – law, religion, customs, political systems and so forth – change the practices of comparison? At what points and how do cultural comparisons become part of a narrative of political, religious or imperial power? What is the relation between translatio imperii and other forms of translation inherent in comparison? How do different forms of comparison interrelate and contest each other?   2) The differential roles of past and present cultures in the analysis of cultural difference: what are the consequences of adopting a practice of synchronic or diachronic comparison? When and for what purposes does it become critical to compare the contemporary with the past? Or with other contemporary cultures? Special attention here will be given to the exceptional role of Athens and Jerusalem in shaping the Western understanding of cultural difference. The link between the first and second thematic strands are evident: the choice for religious, political, social (etc) comparisons and the agendas such choices embody, find specific form in the construction of comparisons with the great traditions of religious, political, and intellectual pasts summed up in the classical and biblical traditions.One running thread will be followed through the vast and open-ended history of Western cultural comparisons: Greek religion. The representations of Greek religious thought and practice, so prominent in classical art and literature, continued to offer the Christian West a powerful image of difference at the heart of its shared cultural memory. The reception of Greek religion is a key component in the development of cultural comparison in the West, and it has a long and complex history. The Cambridge Sawyer Seminars will look at four moments in that evolution: the imperial and late antique reconfigurations of a comparative Hellenism, the theological comparatisms of the early modern period, and the development of a science of imperial comparison in the 19th century. Modernity, our fourth area, can – we maintain and set out to demonstrate – only be fully appreciated within this historical perspective, not least since so much of modernity defines itself in hostile or longing contrast to these pasts. Most of the invited participants will be scholars who not only have an interest in the history of cultural comparison, but also work actively in comparative research of their own. Contributors will be asked to discuss the specificities of individual approaches, and to contrast them to other approaches from the same moment, so as to uncover the ideological faultlines involved in the works in question, the stakes at play, as well as the debates, conflicts, and disagreements provoked by the idea of comparison itself.  The first seminar took place in September 2014 and  the second will take place in December 2014. For information about all the seminars please click on the relevant tab on this page.  This preparatory work will pave the way for the conference in September 2015, where the thematic threads of all four comparative moments will be investigated side by side. We will pay regular fares for the air and train travel of all participants, and accommodations in Cambridge Colleges.   ConvenorsProfessor Simon Goldhill (CRASSH/Classics, University of Cambridge)

							A new Research Group on the Politics and Paradoxes of Transparency will launch at CRASSH in 2016-17, run by Ella McPherson (Sociology) and Alfred Moore (CRASSH). The group will explore the ambivalent effects of ideals and technologies of transparency. Transparency is commonly assumed to be a good thing to which regimes, organisations, and even people should aspire. Yet it is also widely recognised that transparency can be corrosive. It seems to be both a cure for and a cause of distrust. It has been associated with ways of taming bureaucracy that themselves generate more bureaucracy. It promises immediacy in personal relations yet can generate distance. Transparency for some can create obscurity for others. Transparency is a complex conceptual compound, a response to very different problems of corruption, limited knowledge, political exclusion and governance in complex environments, each of which invokes distinct and often conflicting political goods.

While it is common to talk of new technologies heralding an ‘age of transparency’, in this research group we want to focus on particular examples of how technologies accelerate, mediate, and co-produce ideals and practices of transparency in three different areas: (i) the public sphere and the production of public knowledge, (ii) political economy and the relations between individuals and commercial actors, and (iii) the reordering of personal relations. We will ask how technologies of transparency reproduce and reorder relations of power, and how opening up institutions and practices can at the same time introduce new patterns of closure and seclusion. In each of these areas we will bring a multi-disciplinary focus on concrete examples, with the aim of developing a more precise set of research questions around the politics and paradoxes of transparency. 

The format will consist of a closed reading group, which will meet twice a term to discuss the texts of authors invited from across disciplines, as well as a one open lecture per term.  Please register your interest below to receive further information on joining the reading group as well as on the lecture schedule.

							Economics affects politics, politics affects economics, and there is politics internal to economics. The Politics of Economics will bring different disciplinary angles together for a discussion of these aspects of the politics-economics relation, and their normative and epistemic consequences.Economics has been criticised from many angles. The Politics of Economics will not rehash these criticisms but will instead examine the ways in which politics and economics have been and are by necessity entwined in order to think about how we can and should structure economic advice.

							To read, and read at the same time one’s own reading, the notion of reading, the mechanical or quasi-mechanical necessity for that particular reading, at this moment, in this place, in this state. […]  To read, and doubt what you read, but in an abstract way, without reading the doubt.—Simone Weil
 What is it to read?  Why and how do we read?Today, the assumption made by most is that reading is about ‘getting’ content. Reading has become so much the medium of consumption, that we are at risk of losing the ability to reflect on the action of reading itself. To do so is to assume that meaning or truth remains stable in a text, and may seem an encroachment on the freedom of the individual reader. Yet liberalism has its own encroachments, assuming not only the possibility but the desirability of disinterested reading.This seminar series, held at CRASSH in 2017-18, sets out to interrogate the assumption that reading should or could be disinterested. It asks instead: in what ways does reading remain interested in questions of truth and meaning?Historically, religious traditions have formulated some of the most detailed regimes of reading, resulting in practices such as Lectio Divina, Quranic recitation and Midrash. But literary-critical disciplines such as philology, prosody and deconstruction have also developed practices of reading which, though they may disavow ‘truth’, share common terms, methodologies and horizons of meaning with religious practices. All these practices, we propose, bear scrutiny as ‘theologies’ of reading. New practices continue to emerge. While some, following Michel Foucault and Peter Sloterdijk, insist on the therapeutic and ‘anthropotechnic’ uses of texts, the media suggests speed and velocity as a criterion of value. In the face of this multiplicity of programs, all vying for supremacy while disavowing the possibilities of a common practice it has never been more important to refrain from asking not only, ‘what do we read?’ but also: ‘how do we read?’Each session introduces two speakers who will deliver brief presentations of a reading practice —historical or contemporary, sacred or secular—and then, together with the group, will discuss a pre-circulated text which resists or exemplifies the style under consideration.

							Imaginative Things: Curious Objects 1400-2000Following a highly successful year in which the Things seminars explored objects and embodiment, during 2017-18 we further our investigation into the connection between material culture and the mind. We explore how objects affect cognition not just in virtue of their functional characteristics or their more obvious ties to human practices, but also through their ability to generate awe, curiosity, whimsy, and drama due to their construction and materials as well as their symbolic significance. 

Imaginative Things examines of objects which may at first appear merely ornamental and fanciful, but which can in fact trigger forms of divergent and creative thinking, as well as a diverse range of emotions that lead to original insights. Things such as these influence cognitive processes via the action of visual and aesthetic stimuli, as well as through the way they engage physically with space and exert agency upon the body. 

We renew our commitment to a nuanced interdisciplinary approach and the desire to bridge the gap between academic researchers with practitioners. Furthermore, this year we dedicate at least one session per term to a ‘workshop’ style seminar, where the discussion of a topic is followed by a ‘making session’. Our aim is to integrate academic investigation with a hands-on appreciation of materials and practices complementing a merely theoretical appreciation of creative processes. Our opening session on Wednesday 11th October constitutes a first example of this new exciting format. We will explore the practice and art of paper marbling with independent artist Hayrettin Kozanoglu and literary scholar Dr Mary Newbould. Future workshops include topics such as leatherwork and taxidermy. Turning the audience into active participants will provide a valuable opportunity to gain different perspectives on materials and practices, fostering a direct engagement which takes into account the emotional as well as intellectual responses objects trigger through sight, sound, touch, and smell. 

Imaginative Things will be run in collaboration with Dr Marta Ajmar at the V&A Research Institute, consolidating a successful partnership which began during the last academic year. Together we will maintain the traditional configuration of Things in Cambridge, while holding one session in Lent and Easter terms at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. This will grant us privileged access to a multitude of objects from the museum’s collection. Our discussions will be complemented and enriched through viewing as well as handling original artefacts. These sessions will thus provide the audience with an extensive, multifaceted, and multi-sensorial understanding of how studying the whimsical side of material culture opens the way to a deeper understanding of objects. Looking into the histories of materials, as well as our mental, emotional, and physical engagement with them, and the cognitive processes involved in creating, interacting, remembering will reveal the power of these Imaginative Things both today and in the past.

The aim of this innovative approach, which is at the cutting-edge of current scholarship, is to further investigate human understanding of the world vis-à-vis objects. These seminars will examine a wide range of embodied practices, focusing on the historical and theoretical underpinnings of this larger theme.The point of departure focuses on the significance of embodiment in all processes of cognition and learning, moving beyond an obstructive divide between 'mind' and ‘hand' - between ‘intellectual’ and ‘manual’ knowledge. In particular, we will probe the interaction of objects in relationship to the body and explore issues regarding sensorial experiences. This new approach will allow us to probe the connection between humans and objects in the wider understanding of culture. Discussions will focus on diverse topics including the making of objects and the skills required, artisanal epistemology, and the languages of embodied knowledge from 1400-1900. We seek to break down the divide between the Humanities and Sciences, and this theme will bring together speakers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds within academia and beyond, such as museum curators, conservators, artists, performers, medical experts and scientists. The seminars will engage with topics from Art History, Musicology, History, Archaeology, Anthropology, History and Philosophy of Science, Medicine, Psychology, and Biology amongst others, in order to foster discussion and the development of ideas within and between each discipline; for instance, we have invited Victoria Bartels to speak about the embodiment of the use of armour in the Renaissance, for a site visit to the Fitzwilliam Museum.In 2016-17, we intend to collaborate with Marta Ajmar (Victoria & Albert Museum Research Institute) who will be a visiting scholar in Cambridge, and Roger Kneebone (Imperial College) to convene the seminars. Together, we will keep the traditional Things format with a two-speaker minimum, but alternate each ‘conventional’ seminar with a new style of sessions, including on-site visits, performance-based seminars, and roundtable-style presentations and discussions. The traditional format will continue monthly, with the new sessions complementing them on alternate weeks. Building on the success of the traditional Things discussion-based seminar, next year’s sessions will also include more site visits and performative aspects to increase audience engagement. Visits may include the Fitzwilliam Museum to see manuscripts in the Founder’s Library in conjunction with a presentation on-site by speakers to explore historical human interaction with manuscripts. Other site visits could include an object session at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology to view fan capes. To incorporate a performative aspect, some sessions would include speakers demonstrating the embodied practices discussed in their presentations. For instance, we will invite Victoria Bartels (University of Cambridge) on Renaissance armour, Professor James Daybell (Plymouth University) on gloves, and Professor John Rink (University of Cambridge) on musical performance. These demonstrations combined with comparative papers will provide the audience with a comprehensive examination of how studying material culture through the lens of embodiment facilitates a deeper understanding of objects and their use, and of humanity’s historical interactions with ‘things’. 2015-16 Things - (Re)constructing the Material World'Things' is now a firmly established part of CRASSH and the interdisciplinary community of Cambridge, having been founded in 2011. In 2015-16, we are focusing on the theme of construction and reconstruction in response to an exciting turn in material culture studies, where scholars have been thinking more about production and collaborating with craftspeople and museum professionals to develop a deeper understanding how objects were made, as well as used and consumed. We want to stretch the definition of 'reconstruction' even further, to explore how scholars are bridging gaps in the archive, crossing disciplinary borders, and collaborating with practitioners outside of academia in order to 'reconstruct' ideas, spaces, and 'things' from the past.

Many of our speakers will be exploring how objects were made and crafted and how knowledge of construction can help us to understand more about how things were used and valued in the early modern world. Some of these speakers will be reconstructing these processes step-by-step in laboratories, workshops, and performance spaces, and we look forward to learning from their practical expertise and experiments.

Conservators and curators have a different approach to 'reconstruction,' and we hope to hear more about how they repair damaged objects and imaginatively bring their collections to life through artistic collaboration and interpretative installations.

Some of our speakers will be performing less literal kinds of 'reconstruction'. We are looking forward to learning how scholars have filled in gaps in their archival sources in innovative ways - employing interdisciplinary methodologies, new approaches to biography and historical fiction, the history of emotions, literary reading, visual analysis, and thinking with 'things' to reconstruct the material world.

While our speakers come from a diverse range of backgrounds - as makers, academics, and museum professionals - they all share a deep interest in objects and place 'things' at the heart of their work. 2014-15 Things that MatterIn the 2014-2015 academic year, we are pushing the already popular series in new and innovative directions. Considering the “material turn” in scholarship, this year’s series will emphasise the importance of materiality in object study, and we have thus entitled the next year’s seminar: Things that Matter, 1400-1900. This play-on-words emphasizes the need to focus scholarship on the material composition of an object in addition to the object’s relevance, appearance, and use. A deeper awareness of the matter will allow speakers to emphasize how the economic, cultural, and physical attributes of certain materials and their meanings contributed to understanding the value and connotations of objects in their original contexts. 2013-14 Things: Comparing Material Cultures 1500-1900With the dawning of modernity came the age of ‘stuff.’ Public production, collection, display and consumption of objects grew in influence, popularity, and scale. The form, function, and use of objects, ranging from scientific and musical instruments to weaponry and furnishings were influenced by distinct  and changing features of the period. Knowledge was not divided into strict disciplines. In fact, practice across what we now see as academic boundaries was essential to material creation. This seminar series uses an approach based on objects to encourage us to consider the unity of ideas of this period, to emphasise the lived human experience of technology and art, and the global dimension of material culture. It does this by inviting pairs of speakers, often from different institutional backgrounds, to speak to a particular kind of ‘thing’ or a theme that unites disparate ‘things’. Previous ‘Things’ seminars have concentrated on the early modern period generally and the long eighteenth century in particular; this year we have taken the step into the nineteenth century, the era that brought us the mass production of ‘things’. Our aim continues to be to look at the interdisciplinary thinking through which material culture was conceived, and to consider the question of what a 'thing' is, with the ultimate goal of gaining new perspectives on the period 1500-1900 through its artefacts.Image by Maggie CunninghamIf you would like to be kept up-to-date with the  events we hold at the Centre and around Cambridge, please join our mailing list

2013–2018Visual Representations of the Third Plague Pandemic is an interdisciplinary research project led by social anthropologist, Dr Christos Lynteris. The project is funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant (under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC grant agreement no 336564). The HI of the project between October 2013 and September 2017 was CRASSH (University of Cambridge). As of October 2017 the project's HI is the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of St Andrews, with CRASSH remaining a co-beneficiary until the project ends in September 2018.The project will collect and analyse photographs as well as other visual documents of the third plague pandemic, which broke out in 1855 in Southwest China (Yunnan) and raged across the globe until 1959, causing the death of approximately 12 million people.As Yersinia pestis spread from country to country and from continent to continent, it left behind it not only a trail of death and terror, but also a growing visual archive on the first global pandemic to be captured by the photographic lens. Rather however than forming a homogeneous or linear visual narrative, these photographic documents provided diverging perspectives on the pandemic, which, more often than not, were not simply different from region to region, but in fact conflicting within any single locus of infection. The project’s hypothesis is that its visual representation played a pivotal role in the formation of both scientific understandings and public perception of infectious disease epidemics in the modern era.While investigating the visual record of the third plague pandemic in East Asia, South Asia, Africa and the Americas, researchers will engage in a collaborative and interdisciplinary analysis of the entangled history of the visual representation of the pandemic, taking as a common analytical ground four different but vitally interlinked aspects of the visual representation of the pandemic:  For further information on the project, please contact the Plague team or sign up to the project mailing list.You can also visit the Visual Plague project blog for updates and news about the team's activities.Principle InvestigatorDr Christos Lynteris, Senior Lecturer, Social Anthropology, University of St Andrews Post-doctoral Research AssociatesDr. des.
