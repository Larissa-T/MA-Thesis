Reading List (or, more formally, Qualifying Translation Examinations Reading List)Preparation and Qualifying Translation Examinations Reading ListIt is expected that in addition to their preparation before starting the Ph.D. program, students will read widely and carefully in Greek and Latin literature throughout their time in graduate school. While students will read a number of authors closely in language courses, literature surveys, and seminars, they should also be in the habit of employing their free time to read Greek and Latin texts.The purpose of the Translation Exam Reading List is to provide students with an organized program of steady reading in Latin and Greek in order to improve and perfect their command of the languages and to gain familiarity with the various periods and styles of literature. The list is designed to be manageable for students who maintain a regular regimen of reading, and it is expected that students will finish reading the works on the list by the end of the fourth semester of the Ph.D. program.While all of the works on the Translation Exam Reading Lists have literary and/or historical significance, the lists are not intended to limit the student’s readings to these authors and works, nor are they designed to be fully representative of the authors and works that constitute Classics as a field of study.While the Greek and Latin Survey courses will not focus exclusively (or even primarily, as the syllabus is formed at the discretion of the Professor) on texts represented on the Translation Exam Reading Lists, the extensive reading required for these classes is certain to help students in their preparation both for the Translation Exams and for their Oral Examinations later.  The main goal of the Qualifying Translation Exams is to test whether students are able to read Latin and Greek with near-complete comprehension.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

Pingree, University Professor and Professor of the History of Mathematics and of Classics at Brown University until his death in 2005. This prize is awarded to the Brown undergraduate from any concentration who presents the best paper in a given year dealing with the rigorous intellectual traditions of the ancient and medieval world and their textual sources (including mainly, but not only, Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Arabic, and Akkadian).The Workman-Driscoll Premium honors the memory of Francis M. Driscoll, '65, and his faculty mentor, John Rowe Workman, Professor of Classics at Brown (1947-1985), and it is awarded to that senior Classics concentrator who best exemplifies the ideals of service to Brown Classics, Brown University, and/or the wider community embodied by Driscoll and Workman in their time at Brown.  Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Brown Classical Journal was founded in 1984 by Professor Alison Goddard Elliott, who nurtured the editors and contributors of that first volume as Faculty Editor. Sadly, the volume was dedicated to her memory. Susan Hueck Allen, then a graduate student, designed the logo for the journal, which was used for the first eleven volumes. The BCJ is published annually and typically is printed in the spring. The purpose of the BCJ is "to encourage and to reward well written essays by students of the Classics at Brown University." Read more about the history of the BCJ here.We welcome submissions of essays, original poetry, translations from the Greek and Latin, art work, or original photographs on a classical theme, from any undergraduate with an interest in the classics. Although we anticipate that the bulk of accepted submissions will focus on Greco-Roman antiquity and on the traditions of classical antiquity in subsequent eras, we also welcome submissions that treat the cultures of any ancient society, East or West.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe department offers graduate work in Classics; a degree of M.A. is available for students already working toward the Ph.D. in cognate programs at Brown. The department also offers graduate work in Sanskrit leading to a Ph.D. in Classics and Sanskrit, and with the Department of History, sponsors a joint Ph.D. program in Ancient History. The director of graduate studies is Jay Reed. The Program Directors of the Ph.D. programs in Sanskrit and Ancient History are, respectively, James Fitzgerald and Graham Oliver. The work of the department is carried on in formal courses, seminars, and guided research, with considerable flexibility in the case of students' special interests and programs. Emphasis is placed on an overall command of the languages, literatures, and histories of ancient Greece and Rome or of ancient India. Students are encouraged to select their courses from a reasonably wide area of interest, and to take account of appropriate study in related departments and programs, such as Comparative Literature, Egyptology and Western Asian Studies, History, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, Philosophy, Political Science, and Religious Studies.Applications for the Classics doctoral program are due by January 1 of each year. All applicants to the program must submit a personal statement, a writing sample, the results from the GRE General Test, and three letters of recommendation (submitted directly by the letter writers). Foreign applicants must also submit the results from the TOEFL exam (some exceptions apply).Applying: All applicants must apply on-line through the Graduate School Admissions Office. Contact for applicants: Jay Reed (for Classics), James Fitzgerald (for Sanskrit), and Graham Oliver (for Ancient History).Doctoral students in the Department of Classics are eligible for a range of funding and stipends from Brown University. General information on funding is available from the Graduate School.In the first year, fellowship support means that the student may concentrate entirely on coursework and preparation for the translation exams. In the second year, the student usually begins work as a teaching assistant, with a work expectation of  not more than 20 hours per week. The stipend is obtained through this type of work, or by working as a teaching fellow, normally through the fourth year. Upon completion of the oral preliminary examination the student may apply for a dissertation fellowship from the University.Beginning July 1, 2017, graduate student stipends have been increased to $30,000/year ($25,010 for the acaemic year, plus $4,990 for the summer). Students who are admitted to any of Brown's doctoral programs are guaranteed five years of support, including a stipend, tuition remission, health-services fee, and health-insurance subsidy. Students in the Classics Department are commonly awarded further funding for their sixth year.Graduate students are eligible for financial support to defray the cost of presenting at academic conferences.Graduate facilities at Brown are particularly rich in the fields of Greek and Latin literature, philosophy, history, epigraphy, and archaeology. Students may take related courses offered in the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, Comparative Literature, Early Cultures, Egyptology and Western Asian Studies, History, History of Art and Architecture, Medieval Studies, Modern Greek, Philosophy, Political Science, and Religious Studies.Brown University is a supporting institution of both the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the American Academy in Rome. Periods of study at one of these institutions are regularly undertaken by graduate students in the department. Substantial financial assistance to attend these programs is available for qualified graduate students. Opportunities also exist for students to spend a summer, semester, or year at other institutions abroad. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe discipline of Classics entails a breadth --and depth-- of focus that is nearly unparalleled. In proceeding to the doctoral degree, each student has the opportunity to enrich his or her knowledge of many aspects of Greek and Latin literature, history, and culture, as well as related fields (e.g., Sanskrit, archaeology, epigraphy). The major steps through which one attains this knowledge, however, vary from program to program. The following section will outline the requirements for progressing through the Ph.D. course at Brown University. Much of the information is excerpted from the departmental handbook for graduate study as most recently revised (December 2012).View the Classics Graduate Program Handbook January 2013View the Classics Graduate Program Handbook February 2011View the Brown University Handbook for Graduate Students.A. Course WorkA student must acquire a minimum of 18 graduate course credits in Classics or closely related disciplines, including at least 6 graduate seminars with departmental, affiliated, or cooperating faculty.  At least two seminars in Latin and two in Greek are required. The content of this course work is determined to some degree (see section B, 'Area Requirements'), but a wide variety of course offerings ensures that latitude is available for tailoring study to personal academic interests. Normally, four courses are taken each semester in the first year, and then declining amounts in later semesters as the student is additionally managing teaching duties, etc.B. Area Requirements1. Proseminar in ClassicsThe Proseminar in Classics is a course designed for and required of incoming graduate students.  The purpose is to make them familiar with the standard research methods and tools of the discipline.  An introductory phase (weeks 1-3) that is devoted to more general topics is followed by a survey of the most important subdisciplines.2. Prose Composition in Greek and LatinStudents must demonstrate competence in prose composition in both ancient languages.  This may be done in two ways; one is by an examination, which may be a 'take-home project' executed over the course of a semester, with the assistance of lexica and other aids. The requirement is more often fulfilled, however, by successful completion of courses in Prose Composition for each of the languages.3. ArchaeologyThis requirement may be satisfied (a) by completing a graduate seminar in the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, an epigraphy course in the Classics Department or an equivalent course approved by the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS); (b) by examination arranged by the JIAAW; or (c) by participation in the summer or regular program of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, in the summer program in Italian archaeology at the American Academy in Rome or by work through other institutions with approval of the DGS. 4. Greek and Roman History This requirement is typically to be fulfilled by passing written examinations of 3 hours each in two of three periods:  A. Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek History; B. Early through Imperial Roman History (through the 4th c. CE); C. Late Antiquity (Greek East and Latin West). The examinations have both an identification component and an essay component. Alternatively, students may choose to fulfill the history requirement by passing a written examination on one of the three periods listed above and by successful completion of two graduate-level courses from the regular ancient history sequence in the other history. C. Examinations in Ancient and Modern Languages1. Qualifying Translation Exams in Greek and LatinTranslation Exams consist of three hours of Greek and three hours of Latin translation in separate exams. Each examination includes six passages, three of prose, three of poetry. Four of the six passages (two prose, two poetry) will come from the Reading List; two passages (one prose, one poetry) will be at sight (that is, not from the Reading List). The exams are to be taken without the aid of a dictionary. The examinations are given three times yearly, in September, in the last week of January, and in the first weeks of May. A Translation Exam may be taken whenever the student has achieved the necessary preparation in that language, from the beginning of the first year, but students are expected to have passed both of these exams by the end of their fourth semester.2. Modern LanguagesBecause of the importance of foreign language scholarship in classical studies, the student should acquire a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Students must demonstrate competence in reading German and either French or Italian. The requirement will be satisfied by passing exams administered by a faculty member. Exams will be one hour written exams taken with the aid of a dictionary.D. Teaching RequirementIt is an integral part of graduate training and professional preparation in Classics to gain teaching experience. Two semesters of teaching are therefore required of all graduate students, one of which must be as a Teaching Fellow (TF).  Teaching opportunities within the department vary; typically,  assignments progress from TA (teaching assistant) duties of working with a professor, grading and facilitating discussion sections, to TF (teaching fellow; a higher stipend obtains) positions where the graduate student teaches a semester-long language course (usually introductory or second-year level) on their own.E. Preliminary Examinations1. Special AuthorsThis requirement consists of two written examinations (three hours each), one on a Greek author or topic and the other on a Latin author or topic; at least one exam must focus on an author. These exams may be taken only after the Translation Exams have been passed. Preparation for these three-hour exams should not extend for more than a year and is undertaken in regular consultation with a faculty member selected by the student.2. Oral Examination on the History of Greek and Roman LiteratureStudents are expected to have read a substantial amount of Greek and Latin literature in the original languages and to be familiar with the history of Greek and Roman literature as it is presented in the standard works on the subject. The oral examination consists of two halves, each of 90 minutes duration, one on Greek and the other on Latin literature. These examinations consist of three segments each – archaic, classical and post-classical Greek literature and Latin literature of the Republic, Augustan period, and Empire. The Greek and Latin Survey courses provide a foundation for the preparation for this exam, although students must also work on their own, expanding their knowledge of the field. Information from general histories of Greek and Latin literature will also serve as a guide to the genres and chronological periods for which students will be responsible. Students should aim at passing this examination ideally by the end of the third year and no later than the end of the eighth semester. The committee of examiners consists of three faculty members: a chair, an examiner in Latin, and an examiner in Greek. These are chosen by the student in consultation with the faculty, their mentor and the DGS. This committee also advises the student in selecting his/her dissertation committee.F. The DissertationUpon passing the oral preliminary examination, the candidate proceeds to dissertation work in consultation with an adviser and two additional readers. The dissertation shall be a substantial and original investigation of some literary, historical, philosophical, linguistic or archaeological topic. A formal defense of the thesis is required by the university, and candidates will (save in unusual circumstances) defend their work before members of the Department of Classics.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Ph.D. program in ancient history at Brown is an interdisciplinary program established jointly by the departments of Classics and History to train ancient historians to meet the needs and goals outlined in the following paragraphs.A great legacy of the Greco-Roman period is the extraordinarily rich supply of important literary texts (“the classics”). Consequently, from its modern beginning in the 19th Century, the historical study of antiquity has been dominated by philology. From nearly that same beginning, however, a few scholars have approached the study of ancient history through methodologies of the social sciences (e.g., Max Weber) or ancillary fields such as archaeology, epigraphy, and numismatics (e.g., Theodore Mommsen, Michael Rostovtzeff). Inevitably, historians schooled in one area have tended to emphasize that approach over the others, producing a natural bias that still divides the discipline. Ancient historians trained in classics departments are often perceived as too philological and unfamiliar with methodologies used in history and other social sciences. Those trained in history departments, on the other hand, are often suspected of being deficient in the classical languages and thus unable to appreciate the nuances of ancient textual sources and culture. Whatever the foundations of such judgments, they discourage desirable syntheses and keep young ancient historians from fully exploiting available career opportunities. After two centuries, therefore, it seems appropriate to combine the three approaches of philology, historical methodologies, and ancillary disciplines into a single program of training in ancient history.  A graduate program that embraces these goals must be capable of helping its students achieve a high level of competence in the ancient languages and philology; it must enable them to acquire expertise in the historiographical methodologies used in the fields of history and the related social sciences (e.g. demography, statistics, GIS); it must familiarize them with the ancillary disciplines of ancient history (epigraphy, numismatics, archaeology, and papyrology); and it must introduce them to other fields that contribute toward a fully comprehensive historical view of antiquity (e.g. religious studies, Egyptology, anthropology, art history). Most of all, such a program must emphasize the intellectual challenge and excitement of moving among various fields, of interdisciplinary interaction and collaboration, and of developing the larger and broader conceptions that can be fostered through comparative history. Students trained as historians and classicists may be expected to be attractive to both types of departments and thus to have broader prospects for a productive career in either.At present, “ancient history” comprises primarily classical Greek and Roman history, including the history of late antiquity. In the future, the program will be expanded (for example, to include the history of the ancient Near East or of the Byzantine empire) as resources (especially faculty positions) allow.  Students interested in the comparative history of the ancient world can pursue coursework and guided research through the Program in Early Cultures.The program is operated and supervised by a Director (currently Professor John Bodel (Classics and History) in consultation with an Executive Committee comprised of the other Brown faculty in Ancient History, currently Professors Graham Oliver (Classics and History), Ken Sacks (History and Classics), and Adele Scafuro (Classics), Associate Professor Jonathan Conant (History and Classics), and Assistant Professor Lisa Mignone (Classics).Tenured faculty contributing to the program, in addition to the ancient historians mentioned previously, are drawn from the departments of Classics: John Cherry (Greek and Roman archaeology), Johanna Hanink (Greek culture and reception), and Stratis Papaioannou (Byzantine world); History: Amy Remensnyder (European Middle Ages); Archaeology: Peter van Dommelen (Western Mediterranean, Phoenecian-Punic archaeology); Egyptology and Assyriology: James Allen (Egyptology) and John Steele (Exact Sciences, Mesopotamia); Religious Studies: Michael Satlow (Hellenistic and Roman Judaism), Susan Harvey (early Christianity, Syriac), and Nancy Khalek (early Islam).In Egyptology and Assyriology: Matthew Rutz (social and political history of Late Bronze Age Syria; Babylonian/Assyrian documents); in History: Brian Lander (Qin and Han China, environmental history).Candidates are admitted into the program by either the Classics or the History Department. The admitting department assumes financial responsibility for all candidates it admits to the program. All applicants to the program should upload their materials directly to the Ancient History portal and indicate by checking the appropriate box whether they wish to be evaluated by the Classics Department or by the History Department. Applications are assessed on a holistic basis, but candidates admitted to the program will normally have at least 2 years (or equivalent) of either Greek or Latin and at least 1 year (or equivalent) of the other. Generally, those with stronger background in history should consider applying through the History Department, while those with stronger preparation in the classical languages (typically a minimum of three years of either Greek or Latin and two years of the other) are better candidates to be considered by the Classics Department.Candidates are admitted according to the criteria valid in the department to which they apply and in competition with all other applicants to these departments. At the very least, they have to meet the following criteria: advanced level in Latin or Greek; at least intermediate level in the other ancient language; reading knowledge in one of four modern foreign languages (German, French, Italian, and Spanish) that are most important for research in ancient history. Applicants to the program will be screened according to these criteria by the program’s faculty before the departments make their decision. Students are strongly encouraged to attain these levels before applying (if necessary, for example, by attending a post-baccalaureate program).The program is designed to take five to six years.  Students are funded by the sponsoring programs and, when available, through fellowships designated for advanced students in the program.Students will take courses that are tailored to their specific needs. Apart from courses in the ancient languages and histories, they will take at least one graduate seminar each semester (until the preliminary exam is passed), including at least one history research seminar outside of ancient history and one classics seminar on a nonhistorical author or topic. In addition, they will take, at appropriate times, in the Department of History, the graduate colloquium on historical methodologies and (if available) a course on theory and/or philosophy of history, and, in the Department of Classics, the proseminar on methodologies and ancillary disciplines.There are six basic requirements for the M.A. in Ancient History:  two sight translation exams, in Greek and Latin literature, administered by the Department of Classics and using the Classics reading list; two extensive research papers; and two modern language exams.  The student must complete three of the four major assignments (ancient language exams and extensive research papers) by the start of the fifth semester, and the other by the start of the seventh semester.  If all four major assignments and both modern language exams are not passed by the beginning of the seventh semester, a terminal M.A. will be awarded.Students in the program are expected to demonstrate, through successful completion of an appropriate course or a written exam, competence in (a) one ancillary field (normally epigraphy or archeology; exceptionally numismatics, papyrology, or art history) and (b) two literature/author Classics courses (including one poetry course or survey)Written and oral exams will be taken in two minor fields: Greco-Roman literature and a historical field outside of Greco-Roman history.The sight reading list is designed to give students guidance as to which authors and works they should read in the original languages. The prelim reading lists will comprise standard works of secondary literature with which students should be familiar by the time they take their preliminary exam. Students are expected to take the preliminary exam by the start of the eighth semester.   This exam will consist of a three hour oral examination in two major fields:  Greek history (from the archaic to the end of the Hellenistic period) and Roman history (from the beginning to Justinian).  There will be one examiner in each field and one presider; the other members of the Ancient History faculty are invited to attend.After passing the preliminary exam, students will choose a dissertation topic in ancient history. The dissertation committee will consist of three faculty who are best able to advise the student on the chosen topic; at least two of these must be among the program’s contributing faculty. Subsequent to the Preliminary Exam and passed by the beginning of the ninth semester, students will present the dissertation prospectus:  a substantial essay setting forth the problematique, a plan of research, and the bibliography to be read and defended in front of the prospective dissertation committee.  The grading will be fail, pass, high pass.  When completed, the dissertation will be defended in an event that is open to all faculty in the sponsoring departments and to students in the program.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownReading List (or, more formally, Qualifying Translation Examinations Reading List)Preparation and Qualifying Translation Examinations Reading ListIt is expected that in addition to their preparation before starting the Ph.D. program, students will read widely and carefully in Greek and Latin literature throughout their time in graduate school. While students will read a number of authors closely in language courses, literature surveys, and seminars, they should also be in the habit of employing their free time to read Greek and Latin texts.The purpose of the Translation Exam Reading List is to provide students with an organized program of steady reading in Latin and Greek in order to improve and perfect their command of the languages and to gain familiarity with the various periods and styles of literature. The list is designed to be manageable for students who maintain a regular regimen of reading, and it is expected that students will finish reading the works on the list by the end of the fourth semester of the Ph.D. program.While all of the works on the Translation Exam Reading Lists have literary and/or historical significance, the lists are not intended to limit the student’s readings to these authors and works, nor are they designed to be fully representative of the authors and works that constitute Classics as a field of study.While the Greek and Latin Survey courses will not focus exclusively (or even primarily, as the syllabus is formed at the discretion of the Professor) on texts represented on the Translation Exam Reading Lists, the extensive reading required for these classes is certain to help students in their preparation both for the Translation Exams and for their Oral Examinations later.  The main goal of the Qualifying Translation Exams is to test whether students are able to read Latin and Greek with near-complete comprehension.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe department provides both specialized training for those who wish to enter graduate school in preparation for a career in scholarship, and a broad liberal education for those with more general interests. Courses are offered from beginning to advanced levels in Ancient Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit language and literature, and also in Modern Greek. Each semester the department offers a number of courses that require no knowledge of the ancient languages, in such areas as classical literature, mythology, ancient history, philosophy, and religion.Programs of concentration may be arranged with emphasis on the ancient languages and literature or on ancient history and culture. There is one standard concentration track: Classics, and seven optional concentration tracks: Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, South Asian Classics, Sanskrit, Greek and Sanskrit, and Latin and Sanskrit from which to choose. All tracks except "Greek and Latin," "Greek and Sanskrit," and Latin and Sanskrit" require the satisfactory completion of eight courses as described below. Programs are flexible and students are encouraged to discuss their plans with the concentration advisor. The introductory courses in Greek and Latin may not usually be counted toward a concentration, but those in Sanskrit may be counted in some of the tracks. Note: Once a student has earned credit for a 1000-level language class,  he or  she may not apply any subsequent class taken at a lower level (e.g. 0300 or 0400) in the same language toward concentration requirements.Incoming students with International Baccalaureate exam scores in Classics or Classics-related subjects should consult with the Concentration Advisor in Classics about course placement and credit.For a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement exam in Latin the Department of Classics awards 1 unassigned credit in Latin for completion of one 1,000-level course in Latin with at least the grade of 'B'. Concentrators are strongly encouraged to integrate their studies in various fields of Classics by writing a senior thesis (which can, but need not, be an honors thesis; is more demanding than an ordinary term paper; and preferably transcends the subject matter of one particular subdiscipline of classics); by participating in a seminar for juniors and seniors (which is designed to provide insight into the relationships among various parts of ancient studies); or by undertaking another kind of senior project that achieves the same goals and is acceptable to the department.Senior Thesis GuidelinesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
