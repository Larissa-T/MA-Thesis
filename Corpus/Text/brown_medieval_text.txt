          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownUndergraduate ConcentrationsBrown’s Program in Medieval Studies currently offers two concentrations: Medieval Cultures and Late Antique Cultures. A concentration in medieval cultures focuses on the sixth through the fifteenth centuries and combines interdisciplinary perspectives on this period with in-depth study of one or two related disciplines. Late antique cultures deals with the third through the ninth centuries, when ancient cultural forms were still in place but medieval cultures were beginning to take shape simultaneously.Vhalla Otarod and the Medieval Studies FacultyEleanor Walsh, Stratis Papaioannou, and Gaby ReyesStay Connected with Medeival StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown(undergraduate major)The concentration in Late Antique Cultures centers on the  third through the ninth centuries inclusive and studies human  activity  in all its variety Arithmeticaunrestricted by the conventional demarcations of   “classical” and “medieval.” The  concentration focuses on the changes in  cultural practices, social patterns, political  and economic forms, and  artistic and literary traditions in the context of  transition and  change.Two courses, one each in Roman history (CLAS 1310 or 1320;  1320 is  recommended) and in medieval history (HIST 1030 or 1040); one 1000 or   2000 level course in an approved language; six other courses drawn from   appropriate offerings in Late Antique Cultures and approved by the   concentration adviser.Honors are awarded to  students who, in addition to completing the  required courses, present a  meritorious honors thesis. The thesis  permits students to synthesize various  disciplines or interests, or to  pursue a new interest in greater depth. To be  eligible for Honors,  students must complete a minimum of six approved courses  in Late  Antique Cultures by the end of their third year with more grades of A   than B. Students should apply for admission to Honors and should meet  with  their faculty adviser(s) no later than spring of the junior year  to plan the  thesis project. Accepted candidates write the thesis in a  two-semester course  sequence under the supervision of a director and  second reader drawn from the  Medieval Studies faculty.Stay Connected with Medeival StudiesProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown(undergraduate major) The concentration in Medieval Cultures focuses on the sixth  through the fifteenth centuries inclusive and combines  interdisciplinary perspectives with depth of study in one or two  disciplines. One traditional area of study is Western Europe, but  students are encouraged to work in other cultural areas such as   Byzantine, Islamic, Judaic or Slavic cultures. It is also recommended  that  concentrators take during their freshman or sophomore year the  introductory  course, Medieval Perspectives. Other courses  that can be applied to the concentration in Medieval Cultures are listed below.Ten courses approved by the Program in  Medieval Studies, including  two courses in medieval history and one 1000 or 2000  level course that  uses primary texts in a medieval language. Students are  invited to  discuss their plans with an appropriate faculty member of the  Program. A  concentration proposal should be prepared in consultation with the  concentration  adviser.Honors are awarded to  students who, in addition to completing the  required courses, present a  meritorious honors thesis.
