The course introduces students to key literary figures and genres of the Russian eighteenth century. Following a roughly chronological order and focusing on the writings of Feofan Prokopovich, Antiokh Kantemir, Trediakovskii, Lomonosov, Sumarokov, Fonvizin, Catherine the Great, Derzhavin, Radishchev, and Karamzin, we will also consider key issues in Russian early modern culture: Europeanization, its innovations and discontents; the meanings and consequences of modernity; the rise of literature and its complex interactions with the state; the problems associated with foreign influence, cultural reception, transmission, and transformation, as well as ideas of cultural rupture and continuity. While the Russian eighteenth century is often perceived by contemporary readers and students as outdated or prohibitively distant, our task will also be to think about its persistent legacies, and some of our readings will come from later periods and reflect on the eighteenth century’s Nachleben.Prerequisites: Graduate standing.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in

This seminar seeks to acquaint students with various approaches to literary scholarship. Numerous methodologies, both Russian and Western, will be introduced and tested with respect to the questions they inherently pose and with respect to their applicability to Pushkin’s Evgenii Onegin, the primary text we will be working with over the course of the semester. We shall be asking such questions as: what is a text, philologically and theoretically speaking? What, if any, are its boundaries? What is the relationship between text, intertext and context? What is an author? How does the classic notion of authorial freedom or agency become complicated through the workings of romantic irony? What is the relationship of author to hero? How are we to understand the introduction of the romantic (Byronic) hero on Russian soil? What is a reader? How are we to understand the interpretive and psychological processes by which a reader “identifies” with her prototype? What constitutes a legitimate reading? What is commentary? What is genre? How to understand the prosaic and the poetic in themselves, and as fused aspects of a “novel in verse,” Pushkin’s paradoxical definition of Evgenii Onegin? What is the relationship of a text to literary history? How to understand such significant literary movements as sentimentalism and romanticism, their formal preoccupations and cultural assumptions? Evgenii Onegin has generated vastly divergent interpretations, from Belinskii, who viewed the novel as an “encyclopedia of Russian life,” to Nabokov’s insistence that the novel and its characters were a purely literary stylization of prior European and Russian sources. These divergences point to two broadly distinct approaches to scholarship, one pointing in the direction of historicism, the other to various formalisms and structuralisms. Over the course of the semester we will be examining both historicist and formalist approaches to the text, those arising from Pushkin criticism as well as from much further afield. We will be exploring the largely thematic and socio-historical approaches typical of nineteenth-century Russian criticism; at the same time we will be asking if 20th-century scholars of the novel, such as Bakhtin, or of cultural history, such as Lotman, might serve to refine the assumptions of 19th-century criticism. At the same time we will be examining the stylistic specificities of the text, focusing on such questions as the correlation of rhythm and syntax or the patterning of the Onegin stanza. Can we usefully compare Russian and Western approaches to genre theory, cultural history, intertextuality, romantic irony, the unconscious, gender and sexuality?Requirements: Students are expected to have purchased and already read Evgenii Onegin prior to the commencement of the semester.  All other readings are to be provided online on bCourses. Make sure to bring a copy of the novel as well as the week’s readings (as a hard copy or on your computer) every week.The final grade will be based on:Required text:

We will focus on movements and moments in Russian literary history that have affirmed the value of texts based on documents and eyewitness experience over the truth claims of fiction. In theoretical terms, the course will involve a historical exploration of the ways in which the lines between fact and fiction, dokumental’naia proza and khudozhestvennaia proza, have been drawn.Central to our concerns will be the “literature of fact” movement of the 1920s, a development within the left avant-garde that insisted on the abolition of fiction and the distribution of texts based on socially useful factual information. We will situate the factographers within contemporary debates on the form and function of revolutionary literature, comparing factographic theory and practice (Tret’iakov, Chuzhak, Brik, Kushner) with the work of other contemporary writers who interrogate the line between fact and fiction (Babel, Pil’niak, Kataev, Shklovskii). Contemporaneous debates on “played” vs “unplayed” cinema will also merit our attention (Eisenstein, Vertov, Kalatozov), as will theorizations of the status and role of photography. In addition, the course will trace a pre-history of factography in the ocherki of the 19th century, and examine the afterlives of factography in postwar documentary prose (Solzhenitsyn, Adamovich, Alexievich).Alongside recent work on documentary writing in the Slavic field (Fore, Papazian, Toker), theoretical readings will offer a set of conceptual frameworks for thinking about the distinctions between fact and fiction and the role of documentary writing within a literary system (Tret’iakov, Chuzhak, Brik, Shklovskii, Tynianov, Lukacs, Ginzburg, Genette, Barthes, Derrida, Lejeune).Prerequisites:  Graduate standing; consent of instructor.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in

Satisfies L&S Arts & Literature breadth requirement. Cross-listed with Comparative Literature 155, Section 1The 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution seems an ideal moment to go back and examine the history and literature of revolutionary Russia. This was an era of violent upheaval, material destitution, and radical projections of social renewal and human transformation. We will be tracing the arc of the first revolutionary decade, from the revolutionary upsurge of 1917 and the Civil War of 1918-1921, which saw the ultimate consolidation of Soviet power, to the early and often contradictory formulations of Soviet culture arising over the course of the 1920s. Our course will focus primarily on the relationship between literature and revolution, a vital question given the importance paid to written culture by Bolsheviks and non-Bolsheviks alike. How did the writer bear witness to the first socialist revolution in history? Is revolution an event or a process, and how might it be narrated? Is literature a mirror of history or can it also serve actively to shape change? How did the principle literary genres — poetry, drama, the short story and the novel — serve the goal of imaging the revolution? How did political and literary theory animate the debates of the time? Was there room for satire and laughter in a socialist society? If the 20th century can be deemed the era of utopia and dystopia, what does Russian literature teach us about the hopes and failures of revolutionary transformation?Writers and thinkers we will be reading include John Reed and Victor Serge, Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Velimir Khlebnikov, Isaak Babel and Boris Pilnyak, Viktor Shklovsky and Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Zoshchenko and Yuri Olesha, Evgeny Zamyatin and Andrei Platonov.

Satisfies L&S Arts & Literature breadth requirement. We will read some of the celebrated works of the Russian nineteenth-century, from Pushkin through Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy to Chekhov.It is the nineteenth century that poses the decisive questions of Russian modernity: the quest for an identity for the nation and its language, the problem of literary realism, the responsibilities of literature as an agent of social change, the status of the writer within changing social hierarchies, the correlation of the personal and the collective, the political and the metaphysical. These are decades of formal exploration and cultural anxiety, existential doubt and political denunciation. To define the nineteenth century and its questions and make them speak to us will be our goal this semester.The course is a prerequisite for admission to the Slavic major and is recommended for prospective graduate students in Slavic.

This seminar seeks to acquaint students with various approaches to literary scholarship. Numerous methodologies, both Russian and Western, will be introduced and tested with respect to the questions they inherently pose and with respect to their applicability to Pushkin’s Evgenii Onegin, the primary text we will be working with over the course of the semester. We shall be asking such questions as: what is a text, philologically and theoretically speaking? What, if any, are its boundaries? What is the relationship between text, intertext and context? What is an author? How does the classic notion of authorial freedom or agency become complicated through the workings of romantic irony? What is the relationship of author to hero? How are we to understand the introduction of the romantic (Byronic) hero on Russian soil? What is a reader? How are we to understand the interpretive and psychological processes by which a reader “identifies” with her prototype? What constitutes a legitimate reading? What is commentary? What is genre? How to understand the prosaic and the poetic in themselves, and as fused aspects of a “novel in verse,” Pushkin’s paradoxical definition of Evgenii Onegin? What is the relationship of a text to literary history? How to understand such significant literary movements as sentimentalism and romanticism, their formal preoccupations and cultural assumptions? Evgenii Onegin has generated vastly divergent interpretations, from Belinskii, who viewed the novel as an “encyclopedia of Russian life,” to Nabokov’s insistence that the novel and its characters were a purely literary stylization of prior European and Russian sources. These divergences point to two broadly distinct approaches to scholarship, one pointing in the direction of historicism, the other to various formalisms and structuralisms. Over the course of the semester we will be examining both historicist and formalist approaches to the text, those arising from Pushkin criticism as well as from much further afield. We will be exploring the largely thematic and socio-historical approaches typical of nineteenth-century Russian criticism; at the same time we will be asking if 20th-century scholars of the novel, such as Bakhtin, or of cultural history, such as Lotman, might serve to refine the assumptions of 19th-century criticism. At the same time we will be examining the stylistic specificities of the text, focusing on such questions as the correlation of rhythm and syntax or the patterning of the Onegin stanza. Can we usefully compare Russian and Western approaches to genre theory, cultural history, intertextuality, romantic irony, the unconscious, gender and sexuality?Requirements: Students are expected to have purchased and already read Evgenii Onegin prior to the commencement of the semester.  All other readings are to be provided online on bCourses. Make sure to bring a copy of the novel as well as the week’s readings (as a hard copy or on your computer) every week.The final grade will be based on:Required text:

This course satisfies the first half or the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.Despite the geographical and temporal distances separating them, Russian literature of the 19th century has been productively linked to the Southern Gothic mode in 20th-century American fiction. Common to both traditions is a preoccupation with the demonic side of everyday life—largely seen as resulting from inherently unequal socioeconomic systems—and a corresponding tendency to blur the line between “realistic” and “grotesque” description. In this course, we will interrogate the tension between avowedly realist representations of daily life and human psychology, and those representations that have been labeled Gothic or grotesque. We will read selected texts from Russian writers including Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Goncharov, Ivan Turgenev, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, alongside texts by Southern writers that may include William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, and Carson McCullers, among others. We may also consider the Southern Gothic mode in other types of contemporary media, including the television series True Detective and American Horror Story.Over the course of the semester we will attempt to answer the following questions: How do we define the category of the “grotesque” in contradistinction to the “real”? Is the grotesque capable of conveying moral and psychological truths in a way that is inaccessible to more traditional forms of realistic description? What are the sociopolitical conditions that give rise to grotesque art? And finally, how do these conditions manifest themselves in both 19th-century Russia and 20th-century American South, so that Southern modernists frequently drew inspiration from the Russian realist tradition?While these questions will guide the readings and discussions that form the structural centerpiece of this course, we will also focus on developing the skills of college-level critical reading and writing. In this course students will outline, draft, write, and rewrite a series of essays, honing their ability to read closely and craft persuasive written arguments.While the majority of readings will be provided either online or in a course reader, students should purchase the following texts: Nikolai Gogol. Dead Souls. Trans. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. Vintage, 1997. [ISBN-10: 0679776443; ISBN-13: 9780679776444]Fyodor Dostoevsky. The Double and The Gambler. Trans.

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement. How much oppression can a person take without fighting back?What are the ethics of not following the rules?In Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, the hero murders an exploitative pawnbroker on behalf of social justice. In the works of Nikolai Gogol, characters undergo the experience of being treated as nobodies: underprivileged, with nothing to offer to a ruthless, competitive world. Anton Chekhov’s short stories convey the crushing despair of guilt in the face of other people’s oppression and the seeming pointlessness of action in a world so full of injustice for so many people.The goal of this class will be to address the question of action in the face of social injustice. We’ll look at this question through the study of Russian literature, but we’ll also think about ways to connect the issues raised in the texts we read to the pressing issues of our current time and space. In particular, by investigating the large gap between the rich and the poor in Russia in the mid- to late 1800s, we will engage the broader question of oppression and resistance.As this course is dedicated to developing the skills of college-level writing, we will focus on expanding and expressing our ideas through writing. A key aim will be to learn techniques that help us organize complex ideas into argumentation, and to develop our own writerly voice.In contemporary literature from across the globe, we continue to see the influence of Russian writers, whose themes we will use to reflect the struggles of our own times. In particular, we will read from the work one American author, Ralph Ellison, and one contemporary Indian author, Aravind Adiga, to see how Dostoevsky’s themes in particular can be used to think about American racism and contemporary classism. As we will see, readers of Russian literature are given the opportunity to ponder deep questions about the experience of oppression—both our own and other people’s— and to consider the variety of human responses to that oppression.Students should purchase: (Note: most readings will be compiled into a course reader)Aravind Adiga, The White Tiger: A Novel, ISBN: 1416562591Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment (trans.

This course fulfills the second half, or “B” portion, of the Reading and Composition requirement.Fairy tales tend to be a fraught place for women. If they are not witches, evil queens, stepmothers, or stepsisters, then they are often orphans, endure terrible abuse, or in a best case scenario, are simply prizes to be given away to a successful male hero right before the “happily ever after.” In twentieth century literature, many women writers have attempted to bring the fairy tale back under female control by rewriting it. These are texts in which gender roles are reversed, folklore logic is thrown into question, or women characters from classic fairy tales get to tell their side of the story. Although we will primarily focus on Slavic fairy tales and Slavic women writers, especially the short stories of Tatyana Tolstaya and Lyudmilla Petrushevskaya, we will also examine the work of several American women writers and poets, like Shirley Jackson and Anne Sexton. During this course, we will attempt to answer questions like: What is the fairy tale definition of womanhood? What happens when fairy tale types are put into a realistic setting? How does our understanding of a realistic story change when it is told like a fairy tale? How is a fairy tale different when it is told from a woman’s perspective? Together we will look at how each of these writers adapts the raw material of fairy tales, and see what that teaches us about both the fairy tales themselves and the individual writer’s goals.The primary goal of this class is to teach college level writing and research skills. In addition to learning how to make clear, persuasive arguments in papers, we will look at both how to find outside scholarship and how it can be incorporated to support such arguments.Most texts will be provided either online or in a course reader—however, the following novels should be purchased: House of Day, House of Night, Olga Tokarczuk (ISBN: 0810118920)Baba Yaga Laid An Egg, Dubravka Ugresič (ISBN: 0802145205)Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading & Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in

From its inception, photography has been hailed as an exemplary method for objectively capturing reality. And yet, photographs can be manipulated in numerous ways, from removing images from their original context to using a “nostalgic” filter on Instagram. This course looks at how writers have reflected on and incorporated photography into their works. We will explore what has fascinated writers and thinkers about photography as a medium. As Susan Sontag writes, photographs “are inexhaustible invitations to deduction, speculation, and fantasy.”Throughout the course, the relationship between reality and imagination, history and memory, fact and fiction will demand our attention. As we read, some of the questions we will consider are: What is the relationship between word and image? How do writers use the photograph album to narrate? Do photographs verify or deceive? What would it mean to narrate photographically?We will explore a range of genres that engage with photography and its narrative potentials, including: poems by Vladimir Mayakovsky; short stories by Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Andrei Bitov, Dubravka Ugrešić, and W.G. Sebald; essays by Ilya Ehrenburg and Joseph Brodsky; a memoir by Vladimir Nabokov; films by Dziga Vertov, Alfred Hitchcock, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Chris Marker; as well as a theoretical text on photography by Roland Barthes.The primary goal of this course is to develop our reading and writing skills. Students will be guided through the various stages of writing, such as outlining, drafting, writing, and revising. Students will also gain experience finding, evaluating, and incorporating secondary sources to support their arguments.Most texts will be available either online or in a course reader. Students should purchase the following texts:Roland Barthes, Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography, trans. Richard Howard (New York: Hill and Wang, 2010).

This course satisfies the first half or the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.This course focuses on literary texts and films that significantly engage with historical conflicts in the modern period, with a specific focus on the Slavic speaking world. We will examine literary and filmic representations of historical warfare, keeping in mind the temporal and geographical context of each work. The majority of our attention will be on the variety of generic and rhetorical positions authors take as they represent war. We will analyze the seeming paradox at the root of artistic representation of conflict: that the upheaval of war seems both to demand representation and to inhibit it.Out of this paradox emerge many of the course’s major questions: What characteristic genres or tropes recur in these texts, though they may be written decades apart and in different regions of the globe? Do war stories differ when they are told from the perspective of civilians or soldiers, women or men, victims or perpetrators? How do particular media shape stories? What role do “truth” or “accuracy” play in navigating between lived experience and artistic representation? Is the changing face of war across the long 20th century matched by changes in its treatment in literature and film? Are there, after all, unified genres or modes that might legitimately be termed “war literature” or “war film”?This class will provide opportunities to develop three interrelated skills: critical reading, meaningful discussion, and clear academic writing. By the end of the semester, students will be comfortable analyzing a variety of texts with a careful eye for nuance and considering alternative viewpoints. Reading will be approximately 60-80 pages per week. Students will be expected to complete all assigned reading and come to class prepared to participate actively in class discussion. Writing assignments will include close readings of specific texts and films, two analytical papers, and a final research paper. Over the course of the semester, students will focus on all stages of the writing process: selecting an essay topic, crafting a thesis, developing and sustaining an argument, structuring units of prose, editing and proofreading, word choice, sentence flow, and other topics in grammar, mechanics, and usage.Required Texts:Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading & Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in

This course satisfies the first half or the “A” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.What can a scientist gain from reading literature? Using this as our guiding question, we will investigate several examples of Russian and English literature from the nineteenth century in which the “literary” and the “scientific” collide. We will encounter botched experiments, scientists as characters, dangerous scientific ideas, evolution, scientific expedition and travel, patients, doctors, dissection of frogs, early psychology and neuroscience, social experimentation, and more. We will take a look more broadly at how scientific ideas are absorbed into literature, sometimes with unexpected results. What role does literature play in representing the complexities of science in the real world? What is the risk of applying scientific ideas to society and culture? We will attempt to trace the lineage of debates around the role of science in society and culture, starting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and concluding in the present.This course is primarily intended to develop college writing and critical reading skills. Over the course of the semester, students will write expository essays and practice developing strong arguments through close reading.Texts:Texts for purchase (Important: You must have these paper Norton editions; others are unacceptable).Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, ISBN: 0393927938 (Norton Critical Edition)Ivan Turgenev, Fathers and Children, ISBN: 0393927970 (Norton Critical Edition)Fyodor Dostoevsky, Notes from the Underground, ISBN: 0393976122 (Norton Critical Edition)Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness, ISBN: 0393926362 (Norton Critical Edition) (Supplementary readings will be posted on bCourses)Prerequisite:  Successful completion of the UC Entry Level Writing Requirement.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1A/R5A courses without completing this prerequisite.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in

This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.This is a course about modern urban space—a central feature of our daily experience and identities, but rarely something we stop to think about. This course has been designed to give us an opportunity to do just that: to pause and think about the ways in which urban landscape structures our social and mental life, our habits and our time. What is the relationship between the physical city and the city of social interaction, memory, fantasy or desire—between urban and imaginary space? How do we experience space and relate to other people as we move through cities? And what kind of spaces do we occupy when we read about cities, or when we write about them?The course begins in San Francisco, with Rebecca Solnit’s recent atlas, Infinite City. From unusual representations of an urban space we all know well, we’ll then move through a variety of cities around the globe. We’ll follow Crime and Punishment’s murderous Raskolnikov around St. Petersburg, take a bath in the Parisian crowd with Charles Baudelaire, experience life on a barge with Penelope Fitzgerald in post-war London, and look at early Soviet Moscow through Iury Olesha’s upside-down binoculars. As we learn how to read these texts critically and to write about them as scholars, we’ll also experiment creatively to think about how we ourselves might choose to represent the spaces we live in and our experience of urban life. Navigating through different centuries, genders, and social classes, novels, poems and films, this course offers a chance to reflect on the construction of urban space and the diverse nature of our experiences, in San Francisco and beyond.Primary texts: 1.

This course satisfies the first half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.Over only a few years, true crime narratives have infiltrated popular television and podcasts. But these new stories of crime have older roots that often go overlooked: this course will ask how novels and films from the 19th and 20th centuries represented the intersection of law and morality to give new perspectives on criminal activity. Many have argued that the treatment of crime shows us more about how a society organizes itself than the severity of the crime itself – our course will ask how various artistic forms treat misdeeds.Many of the works on our syllabus are inspired by true stories, and we will navigate the waters of adaptation and the influence of historical reality on fictional narratives throughout our course. We will also trace the rise of early true crime documentary from fictional narratives that were fascinated with deviance.The central goal of this course is to develop the skills necessary for writing clear, persuasive, and well-informed papers. Secondly, we aim to cultivate basic and effective research skills, and to learn how resources like Berkeley’s library help us implement these skills. One of Berkeley’s librarians will visit our class and show us how to make use of the library’s resources. Because our course is an accelerated summer session, students should expect to read over 60 pages per week, and to attend every class meeting – attendance is crucial to success. Class sessions are 2 hours each, and students are expected to participate actively during discussion.Featured Texts:

All Reading and Composition courses must be taken for a letter grade in order to fulfill this requirement for the Bachelor’s Degree. This course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement.2015’s Jurassic World ranks among the most financially successful films ever made, but is it science fiction? Reviews label it a “pure fantasy” “effects-driven” “spectacle”, but the original Jurassic Park – the New York Times bestseller written in 1989 by former Harvard medical student Michael Crichton – was praised for its terse, journalistic narrative and science-driven plot. This class will pose the question of its title – what is science fiction? – as a problem of genre, and will ask: where is the line between fantasy and reality in science fiction, when everything represented either on screen or on the page is speculative, fictional, or, in some cases, impossible? How can we realistically narrate or represent what isn’t real?To answer these questions we will examine short stories and novels of the Russian, British, and American science fiction traditions, including selections from Jurassic Park (Michael Crichton), The Martian (Andy Weir), A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess), We (Yevgeny Zamyatin), and “Bloodchild” (Octavia Butler), as well as the films 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick), Alien (Ridley Scott), and the television series The Twilight Zone (Rod Serling). We will also read some texts concerning the theory of realism in both fiction and cinema.In addition to discussing weekly readings, our goal will be to develop and improve students’ ability to read critically and write clear, well-reasoned, articulate and persuasive papers. Over the course of the semester, students will learn how to move from an interesting question, to a compelling argument, to a successful paper. Students will be encouraged to develop a final research project based on a theoretical line of inquiry that interests them.Prerequisites:  Successful completion of the “A” portion of the Reading & Composition requirement or its equivalent.  Students may not enroll in nor attend R1B/R5B courses without completing this prerequisite.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in

We expect students who enter with an M.A. in Slavic Languages and Literatures from another institution to have preparation comparable to that provided by the M.A. program at Berkeley. Those with an M.A. from another institution, depending on preparation, may be asked to eliminate discrepancies and/or to take a screening (permission-to-proceed) examination. The format of the screening examination is similar to that of the M.A. examinations. This decision is made by the Graduate Adviser in consultation with other faculty members.Note that we do not accept applications for a Master’s degree only. It is also important to note that we do not consider applicants who already hold a doctoral degree in any subject, whether obtained at a US institution or abroad.We select our graduate students on the basis of their record of academic achievement in the past, and their promise of future success in scholarship and teaching. A bachelor’s degree in Slavic Languages and Literatures or Slavic Studies is preferred but not absolutely required for admission; however, applicants with degrees in other fields must have already undertaken significant coursework in Slavic Studies.Before you begin your application, be sure you have reviewed the faculty research specialties in the People section of the web site. These are the individuals who will supervise your graduate education and research; it is important to find a good intellectual fit before undertaking any graduate program.Each section of the graduate application has specific and detailed instructions to help you successfully navigate. In general though, the complete application will include:Applying for Financial Aid is included in the process; be sure to fill out the applicable domestic or International fellowship information sections.You are not required to complete the whole application in one sitting. Answers are saved and you may return to edit or finish sections until you actually submit the application. We strongly advise that you review everything after a good night’s sleep before submitting the application and paying the fee. Once the application is submitted, you are not allowed to go back and make further edits.The application system features a status update page for applicants. You may check this page to see if your official exam scores have been received and letters of recommendation submitted.Timeline: Applicant files are reviewed for completion, sorted and summarized after the December deadline by the graduate assistant. The faculty admission committee reads and evaluates applications throughout January into early February. Decisions regarding admissions will be announced later in February through mid March. We usually invite prospective admits to visit the department in order to meet the faculty, current students, and their potential co-hort for a few days in early to mid March. The exact timing of this visit is announced in February when students are invited.Contact information: For clarification on application procedures, please email the devoted application address <slavicadmit@berkeley.edu>.  If you have specific questions about the academic program, please contact the faculty graduate adviser, currently Lyubov Golburt (LGolburt@berkeley.edu).Students may also write directly to those with whom they are most interested in working. Prospective students are also encouraged to contact any of our current or former students. Faculty and Students are found on the People page of our website.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in The Slavic linguistics track of our program has been considerably reduced in recent years. Because students of Slavic linguistics must do most graduate work in individual meetings with faculty, we aim to admit students who already have advanced preparation in the field and who are able and willing to pursue an independent course of professional training. Admitted graduate students will work on an individual course of study designed on the basis of the program described in our Graduate Student Handbook under “Ph.D. Program with Specialization in Linguistics.”6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in The program in literature and culture provides a thorough knowledge of the evolving literary canon along with attendant historical contexts, while encouraging students to acquire expertise in literary and cultural theory. Those considering applying to the MA/PhD program should consult the section on Graduate Admission and How to Apply. Please note that we do not accept applications for a terminal Master’s Degree.The majority of our students choose Russian as their major language. We encourage students who wish to explore the diverse literary and cultural traditions of Russia, Eastern Europe, and Eurasia. We accept a small number of students who choose Polish, Bulgarian or BCS (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian) language and literature as their major field. In such cases special programs are worked out and students do much of their graduate work independently. These students normally take Russian as a minor field. Students of Russian literature are highly encouraged to study a second Slavic language.Please note that we do not administer a Ph.D. Program in Czech, but Czech may be chosen as the second Slavic language.A detailed description of all coursework and requirements for the MA/PhD program is found in the handbook for continuing students, however a brief description follows:The MA stage of the MA/PhD program requires a minimum of 24 letter graded units and is usually completed in 4 semesters. Most M.A. level students in the Slavic program take four courses per semester. The following courses, designed to develop basic professional skills, are offered on a regular basis (as a rule, every other year) and are intended for all students, regardless of specialization.SL 201        Advanced Russian Proficiency Maintenance
The necessity of this requirement is determined after admission by testing for Russian proficiency.
SL 204        Russian Composition and Style
SL 210        Old Church Slavic 
SL 222        Descriptive Grammar of Russian 
SL 281        Proseminar: Aims & Methods of Literary Scholarship
SL 280        Studies in Slavic Literature and Linguistics (research seminars)The following literature courses, also offered on a regular basis, are elective. In practice, most students choose to take all or most of these courses during the first four years of the MA/PhD program:SL 239        Slavic Literary Theory 
SL 243        The Russian Novel and Literatures of Western Europe 
SL 245A      Sentimentalism and Romanticism 
SL 245B      Realism
SL 246A      Modernism
SL 246B      Contemporary Russian Literature 
SL 248        Topics in Russian Cultural History
SL 287        Poetry, alternately nineteenth or twentieth centurySlavic Colloquium (SL 200): Students are required to register (for no unit credit) and attend every semester of the program.Research seminars (SL 280): M.A. students usually participate in one or more seminars. Topics for seminars vary and are announced a semester in advance. Participation in at least one seminar, resulting in completion of a research paper for a letter grade, is required of M.A. students.The comprehensive Master’s examinations consist of two 4-hour written examinations followed by a 90 minute oral examination. The written exams are scheduled approximately one week apart and one week before the oral. The examinations are designed to test the student’s knowledge of the basic material, the ability to develop arguments and discussions, and to assess the capacity for original critical thinking.
Written examinations with a specialization in Russian literature cover:Exam I (two essays). 1790s to 1840s and 1840s to 1890s
Exam II (two essays). 1890s to 1920s and 1920s to 1990sAn M.A. candidate may pass and be recommended to continue in the Ph.D. program, pass but not be recommended to continue, fail with a recommendation to attempt a second examination, or fail and leave the program at the end of that semester.All students in the Slavic Languages and Literatures Program normally continue taking graduate-level course work for two years beyond conferral of the M.A. as they acquire professional expertise. They continue to take research seminars, language courses, pedagogy and independent studies courses. In addition, Ph.D. students with specialization in Russian literature are expected to broaden their knowledge to include early modern and pre-modern periods (the 18th century and earlier). The following courses are offered on a regular basis (usually, every third year):SL 214           Medieval Orthodox Slavic Texts (varied content; may be repeated for credit)
SL 231           History of the Russian Literature Language
SL 241A/B     Old Russian Literature, Kievan and Muscovite (varied content; may be repeated)
SL 242           Eighteenth-century Russian Literature
SL 248           Topics in Russian Cultural History (on a pre-modern topic)
SL 280           Studies in Slavic Literature and Linguistics (on a pre-modern topic)
SL 285           Eastern Christianity: History and ThoughtRequirements in pre-modern literature:
SL 242, Eighteenth-century Russian Literature and any one other course, including appropriate SL 280 research seminars. (Prerequisite: SL 210, Old Church Slavic, is taken as a part of the M.A. program.).Major and Minor Fields: Ph.D. students who specialize in Russian literature are expected to acquire competence in two fields: a major and a minor field. Students who select Russian literature as the major field are encouraged to study another Slavic language and literature as a minor field of study. As an alternative, other minor fields may be selected and designed, for example, Russian/East European film, theater, history, art, etc. Individually designed minor fields will include course work on historical and methodological issues of the discipline, taken in an appropriate department. (Thus, a minor in Russian art would include course work in the History of Art Department; a minor in Russian history would entail course work in the Department of History.) In this way, Berkeley students receive professional preparation both in literature and in broader areas of culture. All minor fields must be approved by the Graduate Adviser.Those who pursue a Ph.D. in Polish, Bulgarian or BCS (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian) language and literature are strongly encouraged to choose a minor in Russian language and literature; such students follow an individual program approved by the Graduate Adviser.Research Requirement (“qualifying paper” or “publishable paper”): All graduate students are required to submit an extended research paper (on a topic of their own choice) to satisfy the Departmental research requirement. The final version of the publishable paper must be approved by the end of the 3rd year.The Ph.D. Qualifying Examinations consist of two written examinations, four hours each, and one three-hour oral examination. The Ph.D. examinations, test the candidate’s ability to analyze literary texts and to conceptualize the place and function of major texts (as well as events in literary history) within a broad cultural context that includes literary evolution and the development of genres, the history of Russian and European culture, social institutions of literature, the interrelation of Russian literature with other world literatures, etc. The candidate is also expected to demonstrate knowledge of and skill in applying theoretical concepts dealing with language, style, genre, narrative technique, versification, etc. Upon successful completion of the Qualifying Exam, the student applies to the Graduate Division for Advancement to Ph.D. candidacy.The Dissertation Prospectus must be completed and approved by the end of the semester following the QE. The prospectus articulates a student’s dissertation topic and includes a working bibliography. At this point formal course attendance ends and students begin registering in the required units under SL 299 usually supervised by the intended chair of their dissertation committee.The Doctoral Dissertation represents the final demonstration, in the graduate program, of a student’s research and scholarly abilities, and constitutes an original contribution to the field of study. The dissertation must receive the unanimous approval of the committee members in order for it to be accepted as final completion of the degree requirements.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in The department strives to support all our graduate students for six years, and, where necessary, for an additional year. Support comes from a variety of sources: competitive university fellowships, departmental funds, as well as teaching and research appointments. As a rule we do not admit students whom we cannot support.The Slavic Department provides the majority of its students the opportunity to teach as Graduate Student Instructors, or “GSIs,” for which they receive ongoing training in pedagogy. Appointments are made in the spring semester prior to the upcoming academic year. Graduate students teach Russian and other Slavic language as well as individually-designed courses in literature through the university’s Reading and Composition program. Slavic students have also taught in the departments of Comparative Literature, Linguistics, and Women’s Studies as well as in the Film Studies programs.It is rare that we need to hire a student from another department to teach one of our language or Reading and Composition courses. If you are a student from outside the department interested in a teaching position with us, please first contact the Department Chair to inquire if the department is in need of additional GSI’s.Students should be aware of the information and resources regarding teaching that are available both in the Slavic library as well as online:http://gsi.berkeley.edu
https://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/readingcomp/index.html
https://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/readingcomp/resources.htmlContinuing students are given an annual review, usually early in the Spring semesters, to plan funding for research, language acquisition and the coming academic year’s teaching.In general, evaluation of student progress and performance is a continuous process which takes place throughout the year, especially during each semester’s TeleBEAR registration advising period with the Graduate Adviser. He or she also schedules interviews with students at the end of the first year and following major examinations. Those students who are having academic difficulties or whose candidacy for a degree is in jeopardy are given special attention.Each spring semester—due in February—all students (those advanced and not advanced to candidacy) are reviewed by the Department Admissions and Funding Committee. The Continued Funding Application and Progress Report is required of all students (including first year). This form has three purposes: it helps the Department plan teaching assignments and budget financial support for the coming summer and academic year; it provides an opportunity for students to assess their academic progress; it allows the committee to review progress and achievements.
Students with serious deficiencies in their performance or rate of progress will be informed in writing of the specific nature of the deficiency, what steps need to be taken to correct the problem, and given a timetable according to which the student is expected to make improvement. Students with serious deficiencies may be placed on probationary status in the Department, but this is rare.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in Our students frequently travel to Russia, Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, to pursue language study or independent research over the summer. Graduate students additionally participate in professional conferences within and beyond the United States. The annual Continued Funding Application and Progress Report is the medium through which students request additional funds. While the Department makes every effort to support students’ travel and research needs, students are encouraged to first consult the following websites for funding purposes:Graduate Division: http://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/fellowships/

With the choice of tracks, students may develop a program of study that suits their needs and interests. There is flexibility in the number of languages, literatures and cultures studied and the types of courses taken. Whereas some students focus primarily on literature and language, others pursue a program that embraces a variety of related disciplines. All our majors have the opportunity to work closely with faculty in their areas of interest. Many of our students pursue a double major, with the other major in History, Political Science, Economics, Business, Peace and Conflict Studies, and other disciplines. Although much of what we teach is specific to the Slavic field, the faculty is dedicated to helping students develop skills in English expository writing, in interpreting texts, in oral communication, in research, and in critical thinking. As students in a small department, our majors benefit from the accessibility of their teachers and the community of fellow students.For non-majors, we offer a number of courses (taught in English) that fulfill breadth requirements in Arts and Literature, Philosophy and Values, Historical Studies, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and International Studies, as well as courses in the University program of Freshmen and Sophomore seminars. See COURSES.

However, we encourage one year of study in the student’s major language prior to declaration.Consult each track requirements for details.Slavic majors with a minimum GPA of 3.3 overall and in courses for the major are invited to consult with members of the faculty and the Major Advisor in the spring of their junior year about the honors program and a thesis topic. Requirements for the honors program in Slavic include an honors thesis course (H195) on a topic of individual interest. The student writes a thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty (as thesis director) and one additional faculty member (who also reads the completed thesis). The work on the thesis often begins in Slavic 100 in the Fall and is then continued in H195 in the Spring semester.6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in Heritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families or communities, but without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the Department except the minor in Russian language. The requirements may change depending on each student’s language proficiency and academic interests.

The major track in Russian/East European/Eurasian Languages and Cultures offers an interdisciplinary “area studies” approach. For this major track, divided into Russian or East European/Eurasian concentrations, two years of language study (or the equivalent) are required. The major track in Russian Language and Literature focuses specifically on Russian language and literature. It requires three years of language coursework (or the equivalent).An overall grade-point average of 2.0 in upper-division courses applied to the major program is required. All courses fulfilling major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.The Slavic Department’s majors are flexible: we take into account individual students’ academic interests, prior exposure to the area, and knowledge of its languages. We welcome double majors.These major tracks are updated as of November 2017.This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic and other departments and programs, such as Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Global Studies, History, Journalism, Legal Studies, Political Science, Sociology, Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies. While all majors in this track will gain knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student to concentrate on a particular language and culture. Students are advised to see the Undergraduate Advisor in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.Languages regularly offered by our department that can be used for this track are: Russian, Armenian, BCS (Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian), Czech, Hungarian and Polish.Students may declare the major after the completion of two semesters of a language (or equivalent) and one lower division course, Slavic 50.The Department highly recommends additional exposure to language through coursework, intensive summer language programs, or the Education Abroad Program. Lower-division (23 units):Upper-division (25-31 units): Lower-division (11 units):Upper-division (25-31 units):This major track focuses on the study of Russian language, literature, and culture.

A weekly Russian conversation hour is one of the Berkeley Slavic Department’s most lively institutions. The Polish Circle and Czech Circle meet regularly for discussions and social events, and a BCS cultural group is being organized this year. Film showings, of classic and contemporary films from Russia and other countries, are periodically organized by graduate students.The Slavic Department actively encourages students to participate in study abroad programs in Russia and other East European countries. Through the University of California’s Study Abroad Program, students may spend the fall or spring semester in St. Petersburg and do intensive work on Russian language, literature, and culture. UC-sponsored programs emphasize Russian language as well as cultural studies. For information see the Slavic Department’s information poster. Other institutions also offer programs in Russia and East European countries, both during the school year and summer. Please consult with the Major Advisor for information about these programs. Read more about studying abroad on the Berkeley Programs for Study Abroad website.In the world today, in-depth understanding of another culture and knowledge of another language are increasingly valued. Graduates from our department are finding that the recent political, social, and economic changes in the former Soviet Union, East Central Europe, and Southeastern Europe have resulted in an increasing number of opportunities for employment, both in this country and abroad, in fields such as education, journalism, business, diplomacy, social work, health, and environmental affairs. A Slavic major also provides excellent preparation for graduate studies in a number of areas, as well as a sound background in the liberal arts for those wishing to attend professional schools (including law school). 6303 Dwinelle Hall • University of California • Berkeley, CA • 94720-2979 • Contact© 2017 Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Berkeley • Log-in The Slavic Department actively encourages students to participate in study abroad programs in Russia and other East European countries.
