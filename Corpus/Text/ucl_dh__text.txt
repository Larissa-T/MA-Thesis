				    UCLDH
  The UCL Centre for Digital Humanities facilitates various opportunities for study at post-graduate level.  Digital Humanities is a multidisciplinary field, undertaking research at the intersection of digital technologies and humanities. It aims to produce applications and models that make possible new kinds of research, both in the humanities disciplines and in computer science and its allied technologies. It also studies the impact of these techniques on cultural heritage, memory institutions, libraries, archives, and digital culture.Watch the UCLDH video on YouTube (alternative video link to YouKu)The Centre for Digital Humanities is able to capitalise on UCL's world-leading strength in information studies, computer science, and the arts and humanities. It brings together work being done in the many different departments and centres at UCL. Our location in central London, surrounded by the greatest concentration of libraries and professional bodies in Europe, also makes it an ideal base for collaboration with organisations outside UCL, such as museums, galleries, libraries and archives.The MA/MSc programme, offered via UCL Department of Information Studies,  is a new interdisciplinary degree exploring the intersection of digital technologies and culture.It is also possible to study individual modules from the MA/MSc programme as Short Courses such as: These courses can contribute to professional development, and count towards the MA/MSc, should it be pursued further.We have a variety of doctoral students

Humanities. 
				    UCLDH
    UCL Centre for Digital Humanities facilitates the work of students currently carrying out PhD or EngD research, both from the UK and abroad.    PhDs at UCL are normally designed to extend over three years full-time or five years part-time study (unlike, say, North American PhDs there are no taught components prior to writing a thesis).  Further information about pursuing a PhD at UCL, and what it generally entails, can be found in the UCL Graduate School Research Programmes pages. Most PhDs at UCLDH will, depending on their supervisor, be formally part of the Department of Information Studies (DIS), and UCL DIS provides  further information about Research Degrees. Those interested in more technical areas should also look at the UCL Engineering Doctorate (Virtual Environments Imaging and Visualisation) pages, where funded EngD places will be advertised.    We recommend that before you make a formal application you discuss your potential research project with a member of staff at UCL. When you do so, please send a brief description of the topic that you would like to work on- of about a thousand words- and a copy of your CV. Please also copy this to the PhD student tutor of UCL Information Studies as they are responsible for all PhD student admissions in the department.    We are now receiving more enquiries from PhD students than we have places available. Therefore please be aware that admission is a competitive process, and be willing to take some time preparing your application, as a result. We make decisions about who to admit based on how well your proposed topic fits with UCLDH research and your academic track record. If accepted you will be matched with the members of staff whose interests most closely relate to your research topic: we cannot guarantee that you will be able to work with specific named individuals.    Funding for PhDs is limited and competitive, and potential students are expected to pursue all avenues themselves in attracting funding. The Graduate School provides further information about fees, costs and funding, and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) website lists their current postgraduate funding opportunities.    UCL is a partner in the London Arts and Humanities Partnership, an AHRC funded Doctoral Training Partnership offering studentships. Please see the LAHP website for further information and details on how to apply.    UCL is also a partner in the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology (SEAHA), which offers studentships to those interested in pursuing a PhD in heritage science.    Affiliated PhD Students are those whose first supervisor is not from within UCLDH, but whose secondary supervisor is linked to the Centre. The MA/MSc programme, offered via UCL Department of Information Studies,  is a new interdisciplinary degree exploring the intersection of digital technologies and culture. It is also possible to study individual modules from the MA/MSc programme as Short Courses such as:  These courses can contribute to professional development, and count towards the MA/MSc, should it be pursued further.

The Master's degree in
Digital Humanities at UCL draws together teaching from a wide range
of disciplines, to investigate the application of computational
technologies to the arts, humanities, and cultural heritage.  The MA/MSc in Digital
Humanities is a truly interdisciplinary programme and has strong teaching links with:        The programme also draws on facilities offered by:       as well as liaising closely with a variety of
world-class, London based libraries, archives, and museums within the
vicinity of UCL.      The MA/MSc provides research-led teaching delivered by leading scholars.                  In
Term 1 and 2, students take five core modules, plus a further
three from a wide range of options available from various departments and
faculties at UCL. In addition, students write an original dissertation on a topic of their choice in consultation with their supervisor,
and undertake a workplacement at a related institution where they can apply
taught aspects of the programme in Term 3. This allows students who have a
background in the humanities to acquire necessarily skills in digital
technologies, and also makes it possible for those with a technical
background to become informed about scholarly methods in the humanities. The following core modules are mandatory for the programme:    Note that the technical core modules are all at entry level; for 
students that already have demonstrable competencies in these areas, it 
may be possible, subject to the agreement of the Programme Director, to 
substitute modules from other UCL departments. There are also a wide range of taught optional modules that are elective. This is for coursework assignments, exams and the Workplacement Module and is followed by the
dissertation (60 credits). 
                  Academic enquiries should go to the Programme Director, Julianne Nyhan                   Admissions enquiries should go to Sarah Davenport (s.davenport@ucl.ac.uk)                   Core teaching staff

 In addition to the full Master's programme, the following short courses in Digital Humanities are also offered by the department. This is a very flexible programme for anyone looking to extend their skill set, particularly for CPD. Students registered for the Certificate must complete four modules from our DH core and options list as agreed with the Programme Director. The length of time taken depends on the student's circumstances (they may be working full-time or using this programme to complement other studies) and can range from a single term to a maximum of two years.     The course unit value is 60 credits or 24 ECTS which are transferable in the UK and EU. Application is through the UCL portal and the fees are pro-rata (by credits) depending on those for the full Master's programme.  Again this is a very flexible programme with students taking all five core modules from the full Master's programme and a further three from the optional modules list. Diploma students do not take the workplacement or dissertation modules. This can be completed full-time over nine months or by flexible study over two to five years. The course unit value is 120 credits or 48 ECTS which are transferable in the UK and EU.  Under the current UCL regulations for the Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) credit transfer, a student who has already completed a PG Diploma and then applies for the Master’s programme will receive APL of 120 credits; this means that students holding a Diploma in DH would only need to complete the Dissertation to receive the full Master's degree.  Application is through the UCL portal and the fees are pro-rata (by credits) depending on those for the full Master's programme.  If you are currently enrolled at another institution it may be possible for you to study at our department to complement your work. Students usually come for one term and with this scheme, although it is not possible to receive a UCL qualification, it is usually possible to count credit taken here towards the degree in the home institution. This would need to be confirmed with the home institution first.            Many of the modules that are offered by the Department of Information Studies as part of the MA/MSc in Digital Humanities programme work as stand-alone short courses for those wishing to update their professional skills in a particular area. The modules are taught over one term, usually for one morning or one afternoon per week with 30 taught hours of lectures and practicals, followed by a coursework assessment or exam (which is optional for short course students). If the assessment is completed successfully, the module credit can count towards a future Master's degree. Many of these modules are CILIP accredited and so suitable for CPD for Library and Information professionals.          DH modules currently offered as Short Courses include: Digital Resources in the HumanitiesElectronic PublishingInternet TechnologiesIntroduction to Programming and Scripting Legal and Social Aspects of Electronic PublishingServer Programming and Structured DataXML Acceptance onto the module is by agreement by the tutor.  Many other modules from taught programmes offered by UCL Department of Information Studies (DIS) are available as short courses. Details about fees and how to apply are also available on that page.  The MA/MSc programme, offered via UCL Department of Information Studies,  is a new interdisciplinary degree exploring the intersection of digital technologies and culture.

Diploma students do not take the workplacement or dissertation modules. This can be completed full-time over nine months or by flexible study over two to five years. The course unit value is 120 credits or 48 ECTS which are transferable in the UK and EU.  Under the current UCL regulations for the Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) credit transfer, a student who has already completed a PG Diploma and then applies for the Master’s programme will receive APL of 120 credits; this means that students holding a Diploma in DH would only need to complete the Dissertation to receive the full Master's degree.  Application is through the UCL portal and the fees are pro-rata (by credits) depending on those for the full Master's programme.  If you are currently enrolled at another institution it may be possible for you to study at our department to complement your work. Students usually come for one term and with this scheme, although it is not possible to receive a UCL qualification, it is usually possible to count credit taken here towards the degree in the home institution. This would need to be confirmed with the home institution first.            Many of the modules that are offered by the Department of Information Studies as part of the MA/MSc in Digital Humanities programme work as stand-alone short courses for those wishing to update their professional skills in a particular area. The modules are taught over one term, usually for one morning or one afternoon per week with 30 taught hours of lectures and practicals, followed by a coursework assessment or exam (which is optional for short course students). If the assessment is completed successfully, the module credit can count towards a future Master's degree. Many of these modules are CILIP accredited and so suitable for CPD for Library and Information professionals.          DH modules currently offered as Short Courses include: Digital Resources in the HumanitiesElectronic PublishingInternet TechnologiesIntroduction to Programming and Scripting Legal and Social Aspects of Electronic PublishingServer Programming and Structured DataXML Acceptance onto the module is by agreement by the tutor.  Many other modules from taught programmes offered by UCL Department of Information Studies (DIS) are available as short courses.

Term 1 and 2, students take five core modules, plus a further
three from a wide range of options available from various departments and
faculties at UCL. In addition, students write an original dissertation on a topic of their choice in consultation with their supervisor,
and undertake a workplacement at a related institution where they can apply
taught aspects of the programme in Term 3. This allows students who have a
background in the humanities to acquire necessarily skills in digital
technologies, and also makes it possible for those with a technical
background to become informed about scholarly methods in the humanities. The following core modules are mandatory for the programme:    Note that the technical core modules are all at entry level; for 
students that already have demonstrable competencies in these areas, it 
may be possible, subject to the agreement of the Programme Director, to 
substitute modules from other UCL departments. There are also a wide range of taught optional modules that are elective. This is for coursework assignments, exams and the Workplacement Module and is followed by the
dissertation (60 credits).

  The UCL Centre for Digital Humanities facilitates various opportunities for study at post-graduate level.  Digital Humanities is a multidisciplinary field, undertaking research at the intersection of digital technologies and humanities. It aims to produce applications and models that make possible new kinds of research, both in the humanities disciplines and in computer science and its allied technologies. It also studies the impact of these techniques on cultural heritage, memory institutions, libraries, archives, and digital culture.Watch the UCLDH video on YouTube (alternative video link to YouKu)The Centre for Digital Humanities is able to capitalise on UCL's world-leading strength in information studies, computer science, and the arts and humanities. It brings together work being done in the many different departments and centres at UCL. Our location in central London, surrounded by the greatest concentration of libraries and professional bodies in Europe, also makes it an ideal base for collaboration with organisations outside UCL, such as museums, galleries, libraries and archives.The MA/MSc programme, offered via UCL Department of Information Studies,  is a new interdisciplinary degree exploring the intersection of digital technologies and culture.It is also possible to study individual modules from the MA/MSc programme as Short Courses such as: These courses can contribute to professional development, and count towards the MA/MSc, should it be pursued further.We have a variety of doctoral students

    UCL Centre for Digital Humanities facilitates the work of students currently carrying out PhD or EngD research, both from the UK and abroad.    PhDs at UCL are normally designed to extend over three years full-time or five years part-time study (unlike, say, North American PhDs there are no taught components prior to writing a thesis).  Further information about pursuing a PhD at UCL, and what it generally entails, can be found in the UCL Graduate School Research Programmes pages. Most PhDs at UCLDH will, depending on their supervisor, be formally part of the Department of Information Studies (DIS), and UCL DIS provides  further information about Research Degrees. Those interested in more technical areas should also look at the UCL Engineering Doctorate (Virtual Environments Imaging and Visualisation) pages, where funded EngD places will be advertised.    We recommend that before you make a formal application you discuss your potential research project with a member of staff at UCL. When you do so, please send a brief description of the topic that you would like to work on- of about a thousand words- and a copy of your CV. Please also copy this to the PhD student tutor of UCL Information Studies as they are responsible for all PhD student admissions in the department.    We are now receiving more enquiries from PhD students than we have places available. Therefore please be aware that admission is a competitive process, and be willing to take some time preparing your application, as a result. We make decisions about who to admit based on how well your proposed topic fits with UCLDH research and your academic track record. If accepted you will be matched with the members of staff whose interests most closely relate to your research topic: we cannot guarantee that you will be able to work with specific named individuals.    Funding for PhDs is limited and competitive, and potential students are expected to pursue all avenues themselves in attracting funding. The Graduate School provides further information about fees, costs and funding, and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) website lists their current postgraduate funding opportunities.    UCL is a partner in the London Arts and Humanities Partnership, an AHRC funded Doctoral Training Partnership offering studentships. Please see the LAHP website for further information and details on how to apply.    UCL is also a partner in the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology (SEAHA), which offers studentships to those interested in pursuing a PhD in heritage science.    Affiliated PhD Students are those whose first supervisor is not from within UCLDH, but whose secondary supervisor is linked to the Centre. The MA/MSc programme, offered via UCL Department of Information Studies,  is a new interdisciplinary degree exploring the intersection of digital technologies and culture. It is also possible to study individual modules from the MA/MSc programme as Short Courses such as:  These courses can contribute to professional development, and count towards the MA/MSc, should it be pursued further.
