		With the generous support of the Mellon Foundation, the School awards up to three fellowships each year to promising young scholars working at the intersection of humanities disciplines, or between humanities and other disciplines. This Fellowship is intended especially for scholars who work in more than one specialty within the humanities, or whose work bridges from the humanities to science, technology, or architecture. Anna Jones Abramson specializes in interdisciplinary approaches to global modernist literature, with particular interests in environment and climate sciences, affect theory, war, and violence. Abramson received her Ph.D. in English from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2016 and comes to MIT following a fellowship year at Harvard University’s Mahindra Humanities Center. At MIT, Abramson will complete her current book manuscript, The Age of Atmosphere: Air, Affect, and Technology in Modernist Literature. The study explores twentieth-century atmosphere in multiple senses of the word: literal air and weather; public moods; aesthetic and literary ambience. In the first few decades of the twentieth century, technological innovations such as poison gas, the airplane, the radio, and modern weather forecasting made air lethal, palpable, and legible in unprecedented ways. At the same time, modernist writers experimented with new formal strategies for generating literary atmospheres. Abramson’s project traces the historically and technologically inflected convergence of these meteorological, affective, and literary atmospheres, and considers a range of implications for contemporary crises in climate change and climate control.Liz Koslov works at the intersection of media and cultural studies, urban studies, and the sociology of climate change. She received a Ph.D. in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University, where she was also affiliated with the Institute for Public Knowledge. At MIT, Liz will develop her first book project. Retreat: Moving to Higher Ground in a Climate-Changed City, under advance contract with the University of Chicago Press, is an ethnographic account of “managed retreat,” the relocation of people and clearing of land vulnerable to extreme weather, sea level rise, and other effects of climate change. Retreat is based on fieldwork over four years in the New York City borough of Staten Island, where coastal residents organized in favor of government buyouts of their homes after Hurricane Sandy. Lauren Flood works at the intersections of music, anthropology, sound studies, and science and technology studies. She received her Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from Columbia University in 2016, with research and writing support from the Whiting Foundation, the Berlin Program for Advanced German and European Studies, and the National Science Foundation. At MIT, she will focus on a book manuscript based on her ethnographic fieldwork in New York and Berlin, provisionally titled Permanent Prototype: DIY Futures and Sonic Instruments. The project explores how experimental instrument builders navigate ethical labor and cultural citizenship in the contexts of the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos, maker culture, and popular, avant-garde, and underground music scenes. She is especially interested in the cultural significance of instruments and the interrelations between machines, design and craftsmanship, and “hands-on” DIY practices in an increasingly digital world. Sun-ha's research examines the ideals and fantasies surrounding new media technologies. He received his Ph.D. from the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania. His work has been published through journals like First Monday and European Journal of Cultural Studies. At MIT, he will be working on completing one book project and beginning another. The first, Data Epistemologies / Surveillance and Uncertainty, analyses the changing boundaries of the known, the probable and the unknowable vis-à-vis early twenty-first century technologies of state “dragnet” surveillance and self-tracking. The second, A Speculative Literature for a Data-Driven Society, examines the genealogy of our imaginations about data, innovation and surveillance — from science fiction of the early twentieth century to experimental prototypes of “big” data in the present day.   Feng-Mei Heberer studied film and comparative literature in Germany, France, and China before receiving her Ph.D. in Critical Studies from the University of Southern California. Her research explores Asian and Asian diasporic media cultures, in particular how they partake in and represent contemporary conditions of globalization.  At MIT, Feng-Mei will be working on her book manuscript on Asian diasporic video from parts of North America, Western Europe, and East Asia, and how these visual works stage new forms of minoritarian belonging. She will further delve into a new project on the representation of Asian labor in new media industries, analyzing what “Asia” means in a transnational circuit of labor that unequally exploits people and resources for the making of digital devices and online services today.  Mary Kuhn received her Ph.D. in English from Boston University in 2014. Her book manuscript examines the relationship between literature and botanical culture in nineteenth-century America, focusing on how literary domesticity drew upon transatlantic scientific and commercial plant networks. While at MIT, she will consider how literary and scientific studies of sentiment work in relation to one another. Researchers in CSAIL and the Media Lab are approaching emotion through computerized “sentiment analysis” of writing, and collaborations between literary and scientific communities can demonstrate to each the techniques and expertise of the other.    Heather Lee received her Ph.D. from Brown University in American Studies. She studies the historical transformation of Chinese restaurants in the United States from an enclave business into one of the largest mass consumer industries. Blending archival research with quantitative and spatial analyses, this project tells the story of how the Chinese developed a system for shuttling capital and labor across the Pacific that accounts for the Chinese restaurant industry’s rapid growth in the early twentieth century. Alongside this research, Heather is developing a historical database of Chinese restaurants, which she will make publically available through an interactive digital platform on Chinese migration. Peter McMurray is a musician, filmmaker and anthropologist of sound. He received a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from Harvard University with a secondary field in critical media practice. His research engages questions of urban sound and Islam, particularly within the context of transnational Turkish communities in Berlin. While at MIT, he will be working on a book on the Islamic acoustics of Berlin as well as a series of related audiovisual media pieces. These projects build on recent media work on sensory-rich engagements with Islam, including a 16-channel audio piece, God Listens to Those Who Praise Him (2014), documenting some of the multifaceted sounds of Turkish Berlin, and a collaborative film with Kythe Heller, Dear Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, (2013), on the life and legacy of the Sri Lankan Sufi teacher and the limits of visuality. He is also an assistant curator of the Milman Parry Collection of Oral Literature and a co-editor-in-chief of Sensate Journal.    Meredith Schweig received her Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from Harvard University. Her research explores twentieth- and twenty-first-century music of East Asia, with a particular emphasis on popular song, narrativity, and cultural politics in Taiwan and China. At MIT, Schweig will be working on a book about Taiwan's hip-hop scene. The project focuses on how performers have invoked rap as a storytelling practice to make sound and sense of the dramatic social and political transformations that accompanied Taiwan's democratization at the end of the twenty-first century. A second project in development refracts questions about music, memory, and mediation through a study of pop icon Teresa Teng.  Maria received her Ph.D. in Anthropology from Rice University. Her research explores the design practices and ordering logics that shape political participation in late-liberal democracies. Her dissertation project looks at the introduction of an American-inspired political marketing industry into Colombian politics, and how it easily intersected with existing clientelistic political practices. While at MIT, she intends to further explore the features of liberalism that allow clientelism and media-based politics to coexist, and even thrive, under a single system. She is also currently developing a second research project that studies emergent participatory approaches in American urban design. By looking at the participatory methodologies and implementation of public interest design projects, Maria explores how these projects envision a pluralized and socially just version of a market-centered liberalism in the United States.   Rebecca received her Ph.D. from the University of California-Los Angeles in Ethnomusicology. She studies contemporary and classical music in Haiti, focusing upon a wide range of musical groups who have used cultural action for community development. Her dissertation is titled "Power and Potential in Contemporary Haitian Music: Mizik Angaje, Cultural Action, and Community- Led Development in Port-au-Prince." Julia received her Ph.D. from the University of California-Santa Barbara in Literature. She is a literature scholar who studies how changes in the technology of media storage generated innovations in literary imagination, forcing a reconceptualization of what books mean. Her dissertation is titled "Dead-tree  Data: Print Novels, Information Storage, and Media Transition, 1910/2010." Marcella received her Ph.D. from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Communication and Rhetoric. Marcella studies internet gaming in China from an ethnographic perspective, looking at the politics of video games, concerns about "addiction," and the aim of many games to "produce ideal citizens." She situates this study in the internet cafes, dorm rooms, and small apartments where gaming takes place. Her dissertation is titled "The Politics of Internet Gaming in China."    Hye Jean Chung received her PhD in Film and Media Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she concentrated on transnational cinema, cross-border mobility, production studies, digital visual effects and animation, documentary film, East Asian cinema, and Asian-American cinema.   
						As a fellow at MIT, Chung is working on a book project that analyzes the globally dispersed and digitally networked workforce of film production pipelines, and its relation to the fictional spaces, computer-generated imagery and digital aesthetics of contemporary cinema. She is also pursuing another project that explores how media texts, cultural practices, and digital technologies manifest and actualize aspirations for global mobility.
						Her work has been published in journals such as Spectator and Contemporaneity, and in the anthology Documentary Testimonies: Global Archives of Suffering, edited by Bhaskar Sarkar and Janet Walker. Other essays, “Media Heterotopia and Transnational Filmmaking: Mapping Real and Virtual Worlds” and “Kung Fu Panda: Animated Animal Bodies as Layered Sites of (Trans)National Identities,” will appear in forthcoming issues ofCinema Journal and The Velvet Light Trap, respectively. She has recently co-edited and contributed to a themed issue of Media Fields Journal on the intersection of media, labor, and mobility. In addition to her scholarly endeavors, Chung has worked as a journalist, and published translations of literary works from Korean into English and vice versa. Gretchen E. Henderson writes across genres and the arts to invigorate her critical and creative practices. Working at the intersection of literature, art history, museum studies, disability studies, and music, her research explores aesthetics of deformity, museology as narrative strategy, poetics of (dis)embodiment / (in)accessibility / author(ity), and literary appropriations of music. She holds degrees from Princeton University, Columbia University, and the University of Missouri, as well as a Preparatory Certificate in Voice from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. 
						 Gretchen’s forthcoming novels include Galerie de Difformité(&NOW Books, winner of the Madeleine P. Plonsker Emerging Writer’s Prize) and The House Enters the Street (Starcherone Books), as well as a critical volume about literary appropriations of music and silence, On Marvellous Things Heard (Green Lantern Press), and a poetry chapbook engaging cartographic history,Wreckage: By Land & By Sea (Dancing Girl Press). Her fiction, poetry, scholarship, and hybrid writings have been published in a number of journals and anthologies, including The Kenyon Review, The Iowa Review, The Southern Review, Denver Quarterly, Black Warrior Review, Notre Dame Review, Witness, disClosure: a Journal of Social Theory, The &NOW Awards: The Best Innovative Writing, and elsewhere. Her work has been heavily influenced by residencies at artist colonies, by collaborative practice, by cross-disciplinary inquiries, and by teaching at a number of colleges.
						 Among other projects while at MIT, Gretchen will be working on a book tentative titled Ugliness: A Cultural History, while continuing the material, collaborative deformation of her Galerie de Difformité, which invites participation at:difformite.wordpress.com.    Chuong-Dai Vo is working on two book projects pertaining to Asian diasporas and transnationalism. The first book project, An Assemblage of Fragments: Ethics and Aesthetics in Vietnamese Transnationalism, analyzes the relationship among aesthetics, post-war returns, and neoliberalism in literature, films and visual art produced about marginalized subjects in Vietnam and in the diaspora. Her second book project will be a co-edited anthology about contemporary Southeast Asian visual culture—alternative art practices and spaces.  
						She is co-editing with Mariam Lam and contributing to a special issue of Amerasia on diasporic Vietnamese cultural studies. Her publications can be found in Journal of Vietnamese Studies, the anthology Political Regimes and the Media in Asia, edited by Krishna Sen and Terence Lee, and the forthcoming anthology Film in Contemporary Southeast Asia: Cultural Interpretation and Social Intervention edited by David Lim and Hiroyuki Yamamoto.Amaranth Borsuk is a poet and scholar. Her PhD. is in Literature and Creative Writing from the University of Southern California, where her work focused on the use of writing technologies by modern and contemporary poets to change their relationship to the page and their constructions of authorship. 
						As a fellow, she will undertake a book of essays on the state of digital poetics and work on her second manuscript of poems. Her essays have appeared in Writing Technologies and the H.D. issue of the Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory. Poems have recently appeared in Colorado Review, Columbia Poetry Review, AND FIELD, among other journals. Her long poem, Tonal Saw, was published as a chapbook by The Song Cave. Collaboration is central to her practice; she has translated and transverted the work of Oulipo poet Paul Braffort, working with Gabriela Jauregui; undertaken a mutationally conjoined poem project with Kate Durbin; and crafted an augmented-reality chapbook with Brad Bouse. 
						In addition to writing and studying poetry, Amaranth is a letterpress printer and book artist whose fascination with printed matter informs her work on digital media.      Joel Burges received his B.A. from Yale in American Studies, and his PhD from Stanford in English and American Literature. His current research and teaching interests include twentieth and twenty-first century literature, television, and film, the relationship between technology and time in contemporary culture, critical theory, and media studies.While at MIT, Burges is working on a book provisionally entitled Turning back the Clock: Technological Obsolescence and Historical Time in Contemporary Culture. An essay on filmmaker Douglas Sirk related to this book has been published in the collection Trash Culture: Objects and Obsolescence in Cultural Perspective, edited by Gillian Pye; another essay, "Adorno's Mimeograph: The Uses of Obsolescence in Minima Moralia," is forthcoming in New German Critique.A blogger at Stanford's Arcade, Burges is also working on other projects related to the status of history in contemporary culture, including: a forthcoming essay on 9/11, Hannah Arendt, and the contemporary novel; research and writing about how televisual fiction alters the shape of literary fiction after 1945, and about how TV shows such as Deadwood build "worlds"; and collaborating on an essay that proposes a sonic vocabulary for the study of film.Wayne Marshall is an ethnomusicologist focusing on the musical and cultural production of the Caribbean and the Americas, and their circulation in the wider world, with particular attention to digital technologies.While a Mellon Fellow at MIT, he's writing a book on music, networked media, and transnational youth culture.

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.eduAt MIT, diversity and inclusion are core values. In MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences these values strengthen our teaching and research, and are embodied in the backgrounds and perspectives of our faculty and students. The MIT SHASS faculty teach a large number of classes on diversity-related issues, including classes with a focus on:
	    • Race or ethnicity in the United States
	    • Cultures outside the United States
	    • Gender and/or sexuality
	    • Globalization or transnationalism
	 See below for a list of diversity-related classes, organized around these four themes. And please refer to the official subject listings for updated schedules and locations. For more information about MIT’s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, visit: http://diversity.mit.edu/

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.eduWho do I talk to about majors in HASS?
	You should speak to someone in the individual department, section or program you’re interested in. This might be a faculty member and/or the Undergraduate Academic Administrator in the Headquarters Office. They are happy to help.What are interdisciplinary majors (formerly major departures) within SHASS?
	An interdisciplinary major is a major by special arrangement in one of six specific fields in Humanities requiring approval by the SHASS Dean. Information is available online or by appointment with the SHASS Academic Administrator. Students write an interdisciplinary major proposal, list the courses they intend to include in their major program, and obtain the approval of the Faculty Advisor for that field. Students receive an S.B. in "Humanities."Can I major and concentrate in the same field?
	Each department, program and section in HASS has its own policy in regard to majoring and concentrating in the same field. You should contact the field office for information on a specific field.If I major in a HASS department how many of my classes can count toward my major and toward the HASS requirement?

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.edu When is my Minor Application due?
	We recommend that you submit your minor application by the end of your junior year. When is my Minor Completion form due?
	The final deadline for Minor Completion Forms is the end of the third week of classes in your final term. Even if you are taking a class for your minor in your final semester, you should still submit the form by the deadline. Forms turned in after the third week of classes in your final term will be subject to a $50 late fee. If you finish your minor before your final semester, you should turn in your completion form as soon as you finish all six of the approved classes.How do I get a Minor Advisor
	Minor Advisors are assigned by field; you can look up the current list here. Please note that Minor Advisors can change as often as every semester; thus it is possible that different advisors will sign your proposal and completion forms.How can I drop a Minor?
	E-mail the SHASS Academic Administrator with your full name, ID, class year and the name of the minor that you would like to drop.Can I minor and concentrate in the same field? 
	Yes. You can build on a concentration to form a minor. Minor requirements are usually more structured than the concentrations, though, so you should consult with the requirements for the concentration and minor you're interested in to be sure that the specific classes you are interested in taking will be acceptable for both the minor and the concentration.If I do a HASS minor, how many of my classes can count toward both my minor and the HASS Requirement?
	Out of the 6 classes required for a minor, 5 may count toward the HASS Requirement. A course must be designated “HASS,” however, in order to count toward the HASS requirement.What do I do if I’ve already filled out a Minor Application but I have to take different classes?
	You should have any changes approved by the Minor Advisor before you make them. In order to do this, you should go to your Minor Field Office, pick up the white copy of your application, make the changes on that copy and bring the revised application to the Minor Advisor for approval. If s/he approves, s/he will initial the changes. You should take your revised and approved application back to the field office, make a copy, and bring the copy to the HASS Academic Administrator.Where can I find my Minor Application so that I can bring it with me to have my completion form signed?
	The white copy of your Minor Application is available in the Field Office for your minor.If I do a HASS Minor, do I still have to do a HASS Concentration? 
	Yes. Every undergraduate student at MIT must file the HASS Concentration Proposal and Completion forms in order to graduate. You may, however, use the same classes toward your concentration that you use toward your minor.Office of the Dean

	As a general rule, MIT students are expected to take their HASS classes at MIT during the regular semesters, and exceptions to this rule are rare. In the rare cases where outside courses are assessed to be up to MIT HASS standards, credits transferred from other institutions, excluding AP credits, may be applied toward the HASS Requirement if the subject is assessed to be equivalent to an MIT HASS course of at least nine but typically twelve units. It is important to note that HASS transfer credit is never guaranteed. HASS transfer credit is automatically denied if a student receives a grade below an A or B, if the subject was not taken for a letter grade, if the subject was taken at a non-degree-granting institution, or if the course was taken during high school with other high school students and/or is included in the high school transcript. All other subjects may be assessed by the relevant Transfer Credit Examiner on a case-by-case basis. For questions about transferring credits, please contact the Transfer Credit Examiner (TCE) in the relevant HASS field. If you are unsure, the SHASS Academic Administrator can help you determine the correct examiner. We suggest that you obtain unofficial written approval from the TCE before starting subjects elsewhere. Please visit the Registrar's Office website for transfer credit instructions and guidelines. Use the following links for information about transfer credit in these specific HASS fields:EconomicsHistoryLiteratureScience, Technology and SocietyPlease note — All transfer credit for HASS classes must be submitted through the SHASS Academic Administrator, Andrea Wirth, 4-240. 
	Bring your completed, signed, and approved transfer credit form to 4-240. This step must be completed after consulting the appropriate Transfer Credit Examiner, but before turning in any petitions for specific HASS or CI credit.
	 For information about receiving HASS credit by petition, please visit the HASS Requirement website.

	 Providing opportunities for interdisciplinary study is a priority at MIT SHASS.
	MIT's mission of meeting the world's great challenges requires not only superb technical and scientific creativity, but also a deep understanding of the human complexities — cultural, political, and economic — in which the world's challenges are embedded. MIT-SHASS offers undergraduate programs which each embrace several academic disciplines to take a multi-faceted approach to these issues. Typically, these programs are taught collaboratively by faculty from various fields in the School and, in some cases, from other schools within the Institute.

The purpose of the concentration is to allow students to focus critical and analytic attention on issues of concern to black communities of the Western hemisphere, to allow students to gain a wider appreciation of the dynamic nature of those communities, and to assist students to understand the historical, humanistic, political and social dimensions of ethnicity and race.Concentration requirements: Four subjects, selected in consultation with the Concentration Advisor. A HASS Concentration may include only one subject that also counts toward the HASS Distribution Requirement. You may include more than one only if the additional subject will NOT count as a HASS Distribution subject in your degree audit.The following subjects, offered by the various departments, programs and sections within the School of Humanities and Social Science, constitute the core of the African and African Diaspora Studies concentration:  21H.229 The Black Radical Tradition in America, HASS-H21H.319 Race, Crime, and Citizenship in American Law, HASS-S21H.358 Colonialism in South Asia and Africa, HASS-H21H.385J The Ghetto: From Venice to Harlem [11.152], HASS-S24.912J Black Matters: Introduction to Black Studies [21H.106, 21L.008, 21W.741, WGS.190], HASS-A/HASS-H, CI-HCan count toward Historical Studies or Humanties and the Arts, but not both.STS.048 African Americans in Science, Technology, and Medicine, HASS-HSTS.088 Africa for Engineers, HASS-H, CI-H  21G.026/21G.326 Global Africa: Creative Cultures, HASS-H21G.346 (Spring 2018 Only) Contemporary Francophone Africa: Francophonie and Beyond, HASS-H21L.007 World Literatures, HASS-H, CI-H21L.504J Race and Identity in American Literature [WGS.140], HASS-H21M.030 Introduction to World Music, HASS-A, CI-H21M.226 Jazz, HASS-A,21M.293 Music of Africa, HASS-A21M.460 MIT Senegalese Drum Ensemble (6 units)Must register for two semesters.

	                                                                                 Great Hall, Ellis Island, New York You may be interested in American literature, folklore or popular culture; in black history and culture; in women’s studies; in American history, politics or law; in the history of science and technology; in American art, architecture or music—whatever the special focus of your interests, American Studies may be the right concentration for you. American Studies gives you a chance to study American society and culture through its history, literature, art, politics, science, music, etc. by constructing interdisciplinary programs, made up of subjects drawn from different disciplines, centered on your particular interests. One aim of American Studies is to help you understand the underlying system of beliefs that informs every aspect of American culture—its myths, institutions, politics and literature, its characteristic dreams and rituals. Another is to understand the uses and limits of different methods and intellectual disciplines as tools for exploring the complexities of a culture. And a third, no less important, is to understand the American present in relation to the American past. To these you will add your own objectives.You can concentrate in American Studies by taking four subjects, at least one of which must be in Historical Studies and one in Literature (variances are possible). Concentrations may be organized around periods, problems, or themes. A HASS Concentration may include only one subject that also counts toward the HASS Distribution Requirement. You may include more than one only if the additional subject will NOT count as a HASS Distribution subject in your degree audit.A concentration in American Studies will well prepare you for further work not only in the various humanistic fields but also in law, urban planning, management, architecture, engineering, medicine, teaching, and any of the media. Consult the American Studies Concentration Advisor with any questions.Below is a partial listing of American Studies subjects. Other courses may be included in your program at the American Studies advisor’s discretion.  21M.215 Music of the Americas, HASS-A21M.226 Jazz, HASS-A21M.283 The Musical, HASS-A21M.284 Film Music, HASS-A21M.295 American Popular Music, HASS-A21W.742J Writing about Race [WGS.231], HASS-H, CI-H24.912J Black Matters: Introduction to Black Studies [21H.106, 21L.008, 21W.741, WGS.190], HASS-A/HASS-H, CI-H  17.20 Introduction to the American Political Process, HASS-S, CI-H17.251 Congress and the American Political System I, HASS-S17.261 Congress and the American Political System II, HASS-S17.263 Electoral Politics, Public Opinion, and Democracy, HASS-S17.265 Public Opinion and American Democracy, HASS-S17.317 U.S. Social Policy, HASS-S17.40 American Foreign Policy: Past, Present, and Future, HASS-S, CI-H17.483 US Military Power, HASS-S21A.120 American Dream: Exploring Class in the US, HASS-S  11.013J American Urban History I [21H.217], HASS-H, CI-H11.014J History of the Built Environment in the U.S. [21H.218], HASS-H, CI-H17.28J The War at Home: American Politics and Society in Wartime [21H.213], HASS-S21G.043J Introduction to Asian American Studies: Historical and Contemporary Issues [21H.107], HASS-H21H.101 American History to 1865, HASS-H21H.102 American History Since 1865, HASS-H, CI-H21H.201 The American Revolution, HASS-H21H.211 The United States in the Nuclear Age, HASS-H21H.214 War and American Society, HASS-H21H.220J Metropolis: A Comparative History of New York City [11.150], HASS-H21H.226J Riots, Strikes, and Conspiracies in American History [11.015], HASS-H, CI-H21H.227 Constitutional Law in US History, HASS-S21H.228 American Classics, HASS-H, CI-H21H.229 The Black Radical Tradition in America, HASS-H21H.315 American Consumer Culture, HASS-H21H.319 Race, Crime, and Citizenship in American Law, HASS-S21H.320J Gender and the Law in US History [WGS.161], HASS-H21H.321J Downtown [11.026], HASS-H21H.322 Christianity in America, HASS-HSTS.026J History of Manufacturing in America, HASS-HSTS.027J The Civil War and the Emergence of Modern America: 1861-1890 [21H.205], HASS-H  21L.006 American Literature, HASS-H, CI-H21L.011 The Film Experience, HASS-A, CI-H21L.432 Understanding Television, HASS-H21L.487 Modern Poetry, HASS-H21L.501 The American Novel, HASS-H21L.504J Race and Identity in American Literature [WGS.140], HASS-H21L.512 American Authors, HASS-H  STS.001 Technology in American History, HASS-H, CI-HSTS.026 History of Manufacturing in America, HASS-HSTS.027J The Civil War and the Emergence of Modern America: 1861-1890 [21H.205], HASS-HSTS.048 African Americans in Science, Technology, and Medicine, HASS-HSTS.049 The Long War Against Cancer, HASS-H, CI-HSTS.050 The History of MIT, HASS-HWGS.150 Gender, Power, Leadership, and the Workplace, HASS-SWGS.225J The Science of Race, Sex, and Gender [21A.103, STS.046], HASS-S This list is not exhaustive.

	  Through a wide variety of subjects drawn from a number of disciplines, this program provides a curricular framework for exploring topics in ancient and medieval studies which range from the history of ideas and institutions to that of material artifacts, literature and certain of the original languages. The chronological span of the program includes some 6,500 years between 5000 B.C. and 1500 A.D.The goal of this program is to develop knowledge and understanding of the more distant past both for itself, in its uniqueness, and as an object of specifically modern questions and methods of inquiry. We are interested in the structure of institutions and social systems, and in relationships between the social order and learned traditions, values, ideologies and ideas. Ancient and medieval studies derive a special claim to our interest from the fact that the record is so full and multiform and that much of it is of exceptionally high quality at once in substance and form.The concentration requirements consist of four subjects, at least one of which is to be taken in the medieval period by students whose focus is to be the Ancient World, or one in the ancient period by those whose focus is the Middle Ages. Subjects listed below as ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL may count for either. At least two of the subjects taken towards the concentration must be taken at MIT. A HASS Concentration may include only one subject that also counts toward the HASS Distribution Requirement. You may include more than one only if the additional subject will NOT count as a HASS Distribution subject in your degree audit.Concentrators may count up to two subjects in Greek or Latin or a medieval vernacular (taken at MIT or other institutions) towards the concentration. Students interested in the program should contact the Concentration Advisor.  4.605 A Global History of Architecture, HASS-A21H.007J Empire: Introduction to Ancient and Medieval Studies [21L.014], HASS-H, CI-H21H.333 Early Christianity, HASS-H21L.001 Foundations of Western Literature: Homer to Dante, HASS-H, CI-H21L.021 Comedy, HASS-H, CI-H21L.455 Ancient Authors, HASS-H21L.607 Greek I [6-unit course] **21L.608 Greek II [6-unit course] **21L.611 Latin I [6-unit course] **21L.612 Latin II [6-unit course] **CC.117J Humane Warfare: Ancient and Medieval Perspectives on Ethics in War [17.05], HASS-H, CI-H  3.981 Communities of the Living and the Dead: the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, HASS-S3.982 The Ancient Andean World, HASS-S3.983 Ancient Mesoamerican Civilization, HASS-S3.986 The Human Past: Introduction to Archaeology, HASS-H, CI-H3.987 Human Evolution: Data from Palaeontology, Archaeology, and Materials Science, HASS-S3.993 Archaeology of the Middle East, HASS-S21H.130 The Ancient World: Greece, HASS-H, CI-H21H.132 The Ancient World: Rome, HASS-H, CI-H21H.230 Barbarians, Saints, and Emperors, HASS-H21H.237 The City of Athens in the Age of Pericles, HASS-H21H.239 The City of Rome in the Age of the Caesars, HASS-H21H.331 Julius Caesar and the Fall of the Roman Republic, HASS-H21H.336 The Making of a Roman Emperor, HASS-H21L.458 The Bible, HASS-H21L.613 Latin Readings [6-unit course] **21L.614 Advanced Latin Readings [6-unit course] **  4.614 Building Islam, HASS-A4.635 Early Modern Architecture and Art, HASS-A21H.133 The Medieval World: CE 200-1500, HASS-H21H.134J Medieval Economic History in Comparative Perspective [14.70J], HASS-S, CI-H21H.160 Islam, the Middle East, and the West, HASS-H21H.238 The Vikings, HASS-H21H.240 The World of Charlemagne, HASS-H, CI-H21H.383 Technology and the Global Economy, 1000-2000, HASS-S21L.460 Arthurian Literature, HASS-H21L.601J Old English and Beowulf [24.916J], HASS-H21M.220 Medieval and Renaissance Music, HASS-ACC.116 How to Rule the World: The Promises and Pitfalls of Politics, War, and Empire, HASS-H, CI-HThis list is not exhaustive.

	 The Legal Studies Concentration introduces students to the academic field of legal studies. Scholars in legal studies draw on disciplines across the humanities and social sciences. The concentration likewise expects students to sample the breadth of legal studies as an interdisciplinary field by exploring the law from multiple perspectives.
	Students will study legal texts and practices, the role of law in processes of social change, and the relationship of law to other forms of intellectual inquiry. Concentrators will develop analytical skills commonly associated with legal reasoning, gain an understanding of the practice of law in the United States and other nations, and explore law’s relationship to social structures such as politics, economics, and identity.
	Concentration requirements: four subjects, selected in consultation with the Concentration Advisor, with at least two from the “Law and Social Science” subfield.

American Studies gives you a chance to study American society and culture through its history, literature, art, politics, science, music, etc. by constructing interdisciplinary programs, made up of subjects drawn from different disciplines, centered on your particular interests.One aim of American Studies is to help you understand the underlying system of beliefs that informs every aspect of American culture—its myths, institutions, politics and literature, its characteristic dreams and rituals. Another is to understand the uses and limits of different methods and intellectual disciplines as tools for exploring the complexities of a culture. And a third, no less important, is to understand the American present in relation to the American past. To these you will add your own objectives.The Major in American Studies consists of a minimum of nine subjects (108 units) beyond the pre-thesis and thesis. Remaining subjects selected from at least two of the three disciplinary areas.Area I: Humanities and the ArtsArea II: Social Sciences; Science, Technology, and SocietyArea III: Historical StudiesUp to six subjects (72 units) may be used for both the major and the GIRs, but the units from those subjects may not count toward the 180 units required beyond the GIRs. No more than one HASS Distribution class may be counted towards the major and towards the HASS Distribution Component of the GIRs. Of the subjects required for the major, at least eight must count only toward this major (and not toward any other degrees, major or minor).A major in American Studies will well prepare you for further work not only in the various humanistic fields but also in law, urban planning, management, architecture, engineering, medicine, teaching, and any of the media. Consult the American Studies Major Advisor with any questions.Click here for the latest listing of eligible subjects and the current degree chart.This list is not exhaustive. Relevant subjects that are no longer offered and subjects with variable topics (such as “special subjects” or “selected topics” courses, for example) may also be counted at the discretion of the major advisor.Additional information can be obtained from the Major Advisor

	 On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks boarded a Montgomery, Alabama city bus on her way home from work. When she was told to take a seat in the back of the bus, then the custom for African-Americans, Miss Parks quietly refused. News of this incident spread quickly and led to a city-wide bus boycott led by a young Martin Luther King, Jr. This is a photograph of the bus, now restored, that Miss Parks was riding the day her courageous action helped spark the modern American civil rights movement.

	  Through a wide variety of subjects drawn from a number of disciplines, this program provides a curricular framework for exploring topics in ancient and medieval studies which range from the history of ideas and institutions to that of material artifacts, literature and certain of the original languages. The chronological span of the program includes some 6,500 years between 5000 B.C. and 1500 A.D.The goal of this program is to develop knowledge and understanding of the more distant past both for itself, in its uniqueness, and as an object of specifically modern questions and methods of inquiry. We are interested in the structure of institutions and social systems, and in relationships between the social order and learned traditions, values, ideologies and ideas. Ancient and medieval studies derive a special claim to our interest from the fact that the record is so full and multiform and that much of it is of exceptionally high quality at once in substance and form.The Major in Ancient and Medieval Studies is designed for students who are seeking a fuller understanding of the forces which shaped the ancient and medieval world. The geographical and chronological scope of the program is broadly conceived and is intended to be comparative. Subjects range in content from Classical Greece and Rome, and the ancient societies of Asia and South America, to medieval Europe and Japan. Students will be required to demonstrate intermediate level language proficiency in either Greek, Latin or a medieval vernacular, but they need not concentrate their other subjects on the area associated with that language. Students are also expected to have some distribution across the ancient and medieval time periods. We expect that students will consult closely with the Major Advisor in order to devise a coherent program of study.As noted in the degree chart, the program includes a minimum of nine subjects (108 units) beyond the pre-thesis tutorial (21.THT) and thesis (21.THU).  The nine subjects must include one language subject in Area I (or equivalent proficiency); the eight remaining subjects must be selected from at least two of the three other disciplinary areas (Areas II-IV), with at least one subject in both Ancient and Medieval periods. To satisfy the communication-intensive (CI-M) component of the program, students may select two subjects from among 3.990 Seminar in Archaeological Method and Theory, 21H.331 Julius Caesar and the Fall of the Roman Republic, 21H.240 The World of Charlemagne, 21H.390 Seminar in Historical Methods, or any Literature seminar (21L.700-21L.715) with an ancient or medieval focus.Area I: LanguagesArea II: Arts and ArchitectureArea III: Literary StudiesArea IV: Material and Historical StudiesUp to six subjects (72 units) may be used for both the major and the GIRs, but the units from those subjects may not count toward the 180 units required beyond the GIRs. No more than one HASS Distribution class may be counted towards the major and towards the HASS Distribution Component of the GIRs.

The geographic region of Asia includes countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In consultation with the major advisor, students may focus their coursework on a sub-region of Asia, on one of the Asian diasporas, or design their program to offer a comparative study across different regions and/or cultural groups. The goal of the Major program is to provide balanced coverage of language, humanistic and social science offerings on the region and to expose students to some comparative perspectives within the region. The MIT Departments of Global Studies and Languages, History, and Political Science offer a substantial number of subjects related to Asia and the Asian diasporas. All Interdisciplinary Major students must write a senior thesis on a topic of their choice to be determined in consultation with an MIT faculty member whose specialty falls within Asian studies. The thesis research may include knowledge of an Asian language.The Major in Asian & Asian Diaspora Studies consists of a minimum of nine subjects (108 units) beyond the pre-thesis and thesis, including two language subjects in Area I (or equivalent proficiency), and seven other subjects selected from at least two of the three disciplinary areas (Areas II-IV).Area I: LanguageArea II: Humanities and the ArtsArea III: Social SciencesArea IV: Historical StudiesUp to six subjects (72 units) may be used for both the major and the GIRs, but the units from those subjects may not count toward the 180 units required beyond the GIRs.

Of the subjects required for the major, at least eight must count only toward this major (and not toward any other degrees, major or minor).The language requirement can be satisfied by taking two intermediate (Levels III and IV) subjects in an Asian language. Students with proficiency at this level in the spoken and written language can either take two more advanced language subjects (highly recommended), or two more courses from Areas II, III and IV. Chinese and Japanese are taught at MIT.

	The Minor Program in African and African Diaspora Studies is designed for students interested in the cultures and experiences of the peoples of African descent on the continent, or elsewhere. The goal of the minor program is to emphasize the importance of Africa and people of African descent in world cultural, economic, and social developments, and to provide a balance between language, humanistic, historical, and contemporary study. The minor includes study of economic and political systems as they reflect the African continent and areas of the African diaspora, and the histories, languages, and literatures of Africans and peoples of African descent elsewhere.
	All of Africa falls within the geographical scope of the minor. A student may concentrate on a particular region or on any of the broad groupings of African cultures, such as Arabic-speaking, Anglophone, Francophone, or Lusophone Africa. Equally, a student choosing to focus on the African Diaspora may concentrate on any group of African-descended populations in the Americas. Students focusing on either principal area (Africa or the African Diaspora) must also take at least one subject which deals with the other area or with interactions between them.
	The Minor Program in African and African Diaspora Studies consists of six subjects (at least three of which must be MIT subjects) arranged in four areas of study:Area I: Language
	Area II: Humanities and the Arts
	Area III: Social Sciences
	Area IV: Historical StudiesAs with all HASS Minors, only five of the six minor subjects may be counted toward the eight-subject Institute HASS Requirement. Of these five, at most one shall count toward satisfaction of the HASS Distribution Requirement. Of the six subjects required for the minor, at least four must count only toward that minor (and not toward any other degrees, major or minor).
	 Click here for the latest listing of eligible subjects.A substantial number of courses dealing with Africa and the African Diaspora are available to our students at Wellesley College, offered through their program in Africana Studies and other departments, and Harvard’s Department of African and African American Studies.

	 Through a wide variety of subjects drawn from a number of disciplines, this program provides a curricular framework for exploring topics in ancient and medieval studies which range from the history of ideas and institutions to that of material artifacts, literature and certain of the original languages. The chronological span of the program includes some 6,500 years between 5000 B.C. and 1500 A.D.The goal of this program is to develop knowledge and understanding of the more distant past both for itself, in its uniqueness, and as an object of specifically modern questions and methods of inquiry. We are interested in the structure of institutions and social systems, and in relationships between the social order and learned traditions, values, ideologies and ideas. Ancient and medieval studies derive a special claim to our interest from the fact that the record is so full and multiform and that much of it is of exceptionally high quality at once in substance and form.The Minor Program in Ancient and Medieval Studies is designed for students who, in addition to the focus of their major program of study, are seeking a fuller understanding of the forces which shaped the ancient and medieval world. The geographical and chronological scope of the Minor program is broadly conceived and is intended to be comparative. Subjects range in content from Classical Greece and Rome, and the ancient societies of Asia and South America, to medieval Europe and Japan. Students will be required to demonstrate intermediate level language proficiency in either Greek, Latin or a medieval vernacular, but they need not concentrate their other subjects on the area associated with that language. Students are also expected to have some distribution across the ancient and medieval time periods. We expect that students will consult closely with the Minor Advisor in order to devise a coherent program of study.The Minor program in Ancient and Medieval Studies consists of six subjects (at least three of which must be taken at MIT) arranged in four primary areas of study:Area I: LanguagesArea II: Arts and ArchitectureArea III: Literary StudiesArea IV: Material and Historical StudiesAs with all HASS Minors, only five of the six minor subjects may be counted toward the eight-subject Institute HASS Requirement.

	 S.B. in Humanities and Engineering  |  S.B. in Humanities and Science 
	Students who wish to combine study in one of 19 fields in the humanities with work in an engineering or science field may pursue a joint degree, earning a Bachelor of Science in Humanities and Engineering (Course 21E), or a Bachelor of Science in Humanities and Science (Course 21S).  If you are interested in this educational option, contact the SHASS Academic Administrator in the SHASS Dean's Office.Possible fields of study and degree requirements
	The requirements for a joint degree, along with a list of the humanities fields that can be incorporated into this joint S.B. degree, can be found in the degree charts for 21E and 21S.  The degree requires 60% of the work in a humanities field and 40% of the work in an engineering or science field.  While the required portion of the engineering and science field is smaller than that of a full engineering or science degree, it does offer flexibility to use the unrestricted electives for other areas of engineering, science, or humanities, creating a more flexible platform on which to build your course of study. Some popular combinations include, but are by no means limited to:Office of the Dean

	  At MIT, we view the humanities, arts, and social sciences as essential, both for educating great engineers, scientists, scholars, and citizens, and for sustaining the Institute’s capacity for innovation.   
	Why? Because the Institute’s mission is to advance knowledge and educate students who are prepared to help solve the world’s most challenging problems – in energy, health care, transportation, and dozens of other fields. To do this, our graduates naturally need advanced technical knowledge and skills — the deep, original thinking about the physical universe that is the genius of the science and engineering fields.
	But the world’s problems are never tidily confined to the laboratory, workbench, or spreadsheet. From climate change to poverty to disease, the challenges of our age are unwaveringly human in nature and scale; and engineering and science issues are always embedded in broader human realities, from deeply-felt cultural traditions to building codes to political tensions. So our students also need an in-depth understanding of human complexities — the political, cultural, and economic realities that shape our existence — as well as fluency in the powerful forms of thinking and creativity cultivated by the humanities, arts, and social sciences.

Minor fields are specified as part of the S.B. degree, thus giving recognition of focused work in a discipline outside the major course of study. Each year hundreds of MIT undergraduates decide to minor in the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, choosing from 30 fields.Why Minor? 
	You may find that your 3- to 4-subject required HASS Concentration has not satisfied your curiosity about your field of choice. By adding 2 or 3 subjects to your concentration, you can build a 6-subject minor that allows you to explore the field in greater depth. A minor is not required for graduation, but you may earn up to 2 minors, whether in HASS fields or other disciplines.
	  You can choose from these 30 MIT HASS disciplines: 
	  African and African Diaspora StudiesAncient and Medieval StudiesAnthropologyApplied International StudiesArt, Culture, and TechnologyAsian and Asian Diaspora StudiesChineseComparative Media StudiesEconomicsFrenchGermanHistoryHistory of Architecture, Art, and DesignInternational DevelopmentJapaneseLatin American and Latino/a StudiesLinguisticsLiteratureMiddle Eastern StudiesMusicPhilosophyPolitical SciencePublic PolicyRussian and Eurasian StudiesScience, Technology, and SocietySpanishTheater ArtsUrban Studies and PlanningWomen's and Gender StudiesWriting For a list of current minor advisors, click here.
	 A HASS minor consists of at least 6 subjects. These are typically arranged into 3 levels, reflecting different degrees of sophistication. You may concentrate and minor in the same field, and use the same subjects for both. You must still submit concentration forms, even if you minor in the same field.No more than 5 of your HASS minor subjects may be applied toward the 8-subject HASS Requirement. Of these 5, only one may be applied toward the HASS-Distribution requirement.Minors are awarded when the S.B. degree is awarded, and must be associated with a specific degree.Subjects taken under the junior-senior P/D/F grading option cannot be used for a minor program.You may use transfer credits toward a HASS minor, at the discretion of the minor advisor. However, MIT subjects must comprise at least half of any minor program.You may not minor and major in the same field.A HASS minor may not be in the same field as the humanities component of a Course 21E or 21S major.You may not overlap more than 2 subjects between a HASS minor and any other degree (major or minor). In some cases, you may minor and major in different, but related fields. Regardless of any overlap in requirements between the two programs, SHASS does not allow students to overlap more than 2 subjects between any two degrees (minor and minor or minor and major).
			 Procedures, Forms, and Timing 
	 Pick up a HASS minor application from the field office, the advisor for your chosen minor, the SHASS Dean's Office (4-240), or the Students Services Center (11-120). You should apply for your HASS minor by the end of your junior year.
			 Consult with the minor advisor about your program of study, and have the advisor sign your application.
			 Submit the yellow (“canary”) copy to Andrea Wirth in the SHASS Dean's Office, 4-240; distribute the other copies as indicated on the bottom of the form.
			 To change any part of your program once it has been approved, consult the minor advisor. Mark the changes on the field office’s copy of your application (the original, white copy), have the minor advisor initial them, and give a photocopy to the Registrar's Office.
			 You must file a HASS minor completion form by the end of the third week of your final term at MIT, whether or not you are taking some of your minor subjects during that term. If the deadline falls on a holiday, forms are due on Thursday instead. Here are the procedures to follow in each instance:If you have completed all of the subjects in your minor program, bring a HASS minor completion form (available from the same sources as the minor application) to the minor advisor for signature, along with an unofficial transcript and the white copy of your minor application (available from the minor field office). Have the head of the department, program, or section, sign the form as well and submit it to the Registrar's Office. You may file the completion form at any point after you have completed the subjects in your minor—there is no need to wait until your final semester--but you must do so by the deadline above in order to avoid a $50 late fee.If you are taking some of your minor subjects during your final term, list these subjects on the bottom of the minor completion form, have the minor advisor and the head of the department, program, or section sign the form, and submit it to the Registrar's Office. The last term subject(s) must be correctly listed. List the exact subject number under which you are registered. Failure to take these steps by the deadline above will result in a $50 late fee. If you need to change a last term subject after submitting the form, you must notify the Registrar's Office immediately. Once a passing grade for these classes has been reported, the Registrar will record that your minor is complete.Please note: As of Academic Year 2010-2011, the late fee has been raised from $40 to $50. Some forms list the old fee, but any late forms will be charged the $50 late fee.If you decide not to minor after you have submitted a minor application, you must notify the SHASS Academic Administrator and your minor advisor. Send an email to both, with your full name, ID number, class year, and the minor you are dropping.
			 Class on field trip for 21H.380 /21A.411/21H.980, People and Other Animals, a seminar on history and anthropology Learn more about The Power of the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at MITAt MIT we view the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences as essential, both for educating great engineers, scientists, scholars, and citizens, and for sustaining the Institute’s capacity for innovation.   
	Why? Because the Institute’s mission is to advance knowledge and educate students who are prepared to help solve the world’s most challenging problems – in energy, health care, transportation, and dozens of other fields. To do this, our graduates naturally need advanced technical knowledge and skills — the deep, original thinking about the physical universe that is the genius of the science and engineering fields.
	But the world’s problems are never tidily confined to the laboratory, workbench, or spreadsheet. From climate change to poverty to disease, the challenges of our age are unwaveringly human in nature and scale; and engineering and science issues are always embedded in broader human realities, from deeply-felt cultural traditions to building codes to political tensions.
	So our students also need an in-depth understanding of human complexities — the political, cultural, and economic realities that shape our existence — as well as fluency in the powerful forms of thinking and creativity cultivated by the humanities, arts, and social sciences.

	 The following Minors in Regional Studies are approvedAfrican and African Diaspora StudiesAsian and Asian Diaspora StudiesLatin American and Latino/a StudiesMiddle Eastern StudiesRussian and Eurasian Studies
	These interdisciplinary programs provide MIT undergraduates with a valuable opportunity to acquire knowledge of a particular country or region in conjunction with proficiency in that region's language. This better prepares them for academic, business, and government careers in a world where regions and countries are increasingly interdependent.Four Areas of Study 
	Because the nature of these minors is cross-disciplinary, combining language study with humanities, arts, and social sciences, they are arranged into the following four areas of study:Area 1  Language (Intermediate level)Area 2  Humanities and the ArtsArea 3  Social SciencesArea 4  Historical StudiesAssembling the Six Subjects for a Minor
	Students are required to take six subjects (at least three of which must be MIT subjects) in the following configuration: two intermediate-level language subjects (Area I) and four other subjects, chosen from at least two of the other three areas. If a student already has achieved the equivalent of intermediate-level proficiency, he or she can take either two more advanced-level language subjects or two more subjects from Areas II, III, or IV in place of the intermediate language subjects. Languages not presently taught at MIT may be taken at Harvard or Wellesley, or elsewhere during the summer with the permission of the Minor Advisor.About Each Minor 
	Details on each of the minors are available on their relevant pages (see links above). Lists of subjects that are appropriate for a HASS minor in each of the regional studies, as well as additional information about minors, advisors, etc., can be obtained from the relevant Minor Advisor or from the SHASS Academic Administrator.

	The Kelly-Douglas Fund was established in 1975 through generous donations of I. Austin Kelly III (1903-2003, SB'26). Its founder and first director was the historian Richard M. Douglas (1922-2005), who came to MIT in 1962 to head the Humanities Department. Upon his retirement in 1991, Austin Kelly requested that the Kelly Fund be re-named the Kelly-Douglas Fund in honor of its first director. 
	       Ironton Austin Kelly                        Richard M. Douglas
	 1996 - 2006
	The Fund was subsequently piloted for five years by the historian Arthur Kaledin, and then for ten years (1996-2006) by the music historian, Lowell Lindgren, under whose tenure the basic policies of the Fund as it operates today were put into place. Professor Lindgren was the motivating force behind the undergraduate traveling fellowships; these were first awarded in 2000, following the silver anniversary of the Kelly-Douglas Fund.      Arthur Kaledin                                Lowell Lindgren
	 Current Director
	The Current Director of the Kelly-Douglas Fund is Professor Shankar Raman of the Literature Section.       Shankar Raman, Director             
	 Areas of Funding 
	The Fund divides its resources over three main areas:1—Teaching and Research Support for teaching staff (primarily faculty and lecturers) and graduate students in HASS. The Fund helps teachers bring in guest lecturers, take students to see a performance, and so on. It assists graduate student research and development through partial support for travel to conferences, libraries, or other repositories of information centrally related to the student's research.2—The I. Austin Kelly III Essay Prizes recognize excellence in humanistic scholarship by MIT undergraduates.3—Traveling Fellowships are awarded to MIT undergraduates who intend to pursue HASS-related or humanitarian projects during either IAP or the Summer.
	 
	 Fund Administration 
	The Fund is housed in the Dean's Office in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Its activities are overseen by a Director appointed by the Dean and a Board consisting of HASS Faculty selected by the Fund's Director. The current Director of the Kelly-Douglas Fund is Professor Shankar Raman of the Literature Section.Enquiries concerning applying to the Fund should be directed in the first instance to the Director; for queries about the disbursement of funds, please contact the Administrator. Board Members serving for the 2014-2015 academic year are: Professors Sandy Alexandre (Literature), Patricia Tang (Music), William Broadhead (History), and Stefan Helmreich (Anthropology).

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.eduHonoring outstanding achievement in non-fiction writing
	To acknowledge outstanding achievement by undergraduate students intellectually committed to fields of study that fall under the purview of the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at MIT, the Kelly-Douglas Fund awards two prizes of up to $800 each to the best essays in any field of study within SHASS.
	Beginning this year the Kelly-Douglas Fund has restructured the terms of the annual Kelly Essay Prize to admit a wider range of student essay submissions than in years past. For this year’s competition, all forms of non-fiction prose are eligible for consideration. In addition to submitting research essays written for SHASS subjects in any of the fields above, students may submit works of 12-20 pages in these genres: personal essays, memoir, cultural commentary, creative non-fiction, travel writing, field reports, and science journalism.Faculty Role
	The Kelly Essay Prize is distinctive in being the only SHASS writing award open to all students engaged in HASS-related studies, with no further restriction on topic and content. Faculty are encouraged to identify high-quality undergraduate essays written for courses they offer, and help students develop them for submission to the essay competition.  Deadline Deadlines for 2017-2018 will be announced soon  Application Process

	 Eligibility
	Any full time MIT undergraduate — with the exception of previous winners of a Kelly Essay Prize — may submit an essay written during his or her years at MIT.  The work may have been conceived for an MIT subject. Contestants are encouraged to consult with appropriate members of the faculty while preparing his or her submission (naturally, any assistance received should be acknowledged in the essay).Format
	Essays may range from 12-20 double-spaced pages, with standard one inch margins. A group of shorter papers, a translation, a work of creative fiction, or a study exceeding 20 pages (exclusive of notes and bibliography) will not be considered.Beginning this year the Kelly-Douglas Fund has restructured the terms of the annual Kelly Essay Prize to admit a wider range of student essay submissions than in years past. For this year’s competition, all forms of non-fiction prose in the 12-20 page range are eligible for consideration. In addition to submitting research essays written for HASS subjects, students may submit personal essays, memoir, cultural commentary, creative non-fiction, travel writing, field reports, science journalism, etc.  Submitting an Essay for Consideration
	Applicants must submit two unstapled copies of the essay. These must be accompanied by an Entry Form which you can download here.The author's name should appear only on the entry form, since submissions are read without the Committee knowing the author's name. The title of the essay should be entered on both the entry form and on the first page of the essay.Submissions should be delivered or mailed to the following address:The Director | Kelly-Douglas Fund, Essay Prize

	The Kelly-Douglas Fund allocates a part of its annual budget to support teaching and research by members of MIT's School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. These funds are distributed on a rolling basis each semester. Since the Fund is a small one and seeks to assist as many deserving projects as possible, grants are typically modest: no individual may receive more than $500 in a given academic year, and a majority of grants awarded are for smaller amounts.
	In general, faculty and students who are part of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences are given first preference. Nonetheless, applications from outside the domain of HASS receive full consideration, as long as they engage intellectual concerns central to the disciplines comprising the School.  
	 
	 Who may apply?
	In general, the Fund accepts applications from graduate students and visiting faculty in SHASS, along with current lecturers who have not received funds from an alternative source.What sorts of proposals are funded?
	Teaching grants take a number of forms. In the past, the Fund has offered partial support for course-related field trips, museum fees, and, on occasion, the purchase of instructional material (on the condition that these do not revert to personal use at the end of the teaching period). The Fund has also regularly helped offset the costs of honoraria for guest lecturers, and subsidized tickets to take members of a class to see a performance. These examples are meant to be indicative of the kinds of activities the Fund supports; they do not exhaust the list of possibilities. Proposals are judged upon the merit of proposed activity and an assessment of their impact upon undergraduate learning.Are there any strings attached to these awards?
	We expect the applicant's home department or section to demonstrate its commitment to the proposed endeavour: applicants are expected to seek and to receive some financial assistance from their home departments before applying the Kelly-Douglas Fund. The Board is aware that departmental resources vary across the School, and therefore does not set a quantitative minimum. It does, however, expect that a department or section will back the application to the best of its ability.In general, the maximum an individual may apply for is $500 — though most grants are for lower amounts. Support to offset honoraria is capped at $200.Who may apply?
	Research grants are limited to applicants whose access to other sources of funding is limited. Consequently, regular tenured and tenure-track faculty are not eligible for research grants. In general, the Fund accepts applications from current lecturers, visiting faculty and graduate students in SHASS.What sorts of proposals are funded?Typically, the Fund subsidizes travel expenses (usually airfare) to conferences, as well to carry out research (for fieldwork or to consult libraries, archives and other repositories of information). The Fund does not contribute to expenses incurred for food or entertainment, or to equipment related to the research project. It has, on occasion, helped offset such costs as indexing services provided by a vendor — though it cannot pay individuals hired by the grantee.Any strings
	The Kelly-Douglas Fund expects the applicant to apply to other sources as well. For conference-related travel in particular, the applicant is expected to receive some departmental support. This requirement is especially important in the case of graduate students: we assume that the primary responsibility for nurturing a graduate student's development rests with the home department, the Fund having consequently a supplementary function. Conference travel is only funded if the applicant is actually presenting a paper — the Fund does not pay simply to attend a conference.The maximum an individual may receive each year is $500.  Office of the Dean

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.eduThe Kelly-Douglas Fund offers research and travel support awards twice a year on a rolling basis. Each semester it distributes funds until the limit for that semester has been reached. Any unused funds from one term are transferred over to the succeeding term. Once the limit for a particular semester has been reached, the Fund will cease to accept applications for that semester and an announcement will be posted on the Fund's home page.For all travel and research to be completed by January 31st, applicants may turn in requests starting on August 1 of that calendar year.For all travel and research to be completed by July 31st, applicants may turn in requests starting January 1st of that calendar year.
	 
	 The Cover Sheet – Download Whether applying for a teaching or a research grant, the request must be accompanied by a signed cover sheet. Applications must be mailed as hard copy Fund Administrator (see address below). Please do not send your own application and cover sheet by email. (Recommenders may email their evaluations, however. See instructions below.)Apart from the usual information (name, contact information etc.), the cover sheet asks for the following:Requests for funding should be outlined in a brief letter that clearly describes the proposed project. The letter should not exceed one single-spaced typed page.What the letter says will depend, of course, on the project itself. For instance, a letter applying for an honorarium for a guest lecturer should provide the tentative title or topic of the lecture and briefly summarize the speaker's expertise and accomplishments in so far as they are relevant to the invitation. It should also tell us about the proposed audience — MIT subject number(s), size of class(es), whether open to the public or limited to students in a class, and so on — and convey the applicant's sense of how the planned event will contribute to the education of the listeners.An application for a research grant would, by contrast, cogently describe the applicant's field of study and specify the particular purpose served by this grant (should the application be successful). For conference travel, please provide details about the conference, including the title and subject of your paper.
	 In general, recommendations are not required for teaching-related grants.For research-related travel, students are required to arrange for one letter of recommendation from a person who is able to speak knowledgeably about the student's research and merit. Normally, the endorsement would come from a thesis advisor, a member of the dissertation committee, or departmental or sectional head. Lecturers are not required to submit a letter of endorsement. However, a brief statement of support from the departmental or sectional head will strengthen the application.The recommendation need not physically accompany the application — if it does, it should be in a separate sealed envelope — and can be mailed or emailed independently to the address below. Note that an application will not be considered until the recommendation has been received by the Fund Administrator.
	 All applications, consisting of a signed cover sheet and a letter of request, should be sent to the following address (if using interdepartmental mail, the street and city information can obviously be omitted).The Director, Kelly-Douglas Fund,

	Once your application is complete, your request will reviewed and you will receive a response as swiftly as possible. If you are the recipient of an award, please contact the Fund Administrator after your travel, to turn in the Reimbursements form and your receipts.Please note that all travel and research grants are only paid out upon completion of the proposed project, and recipients need to provide receipts and evidence of completion before funds can be released. Always keep copies of any receipts you submit.Certain types of activities may be paid for in advance. For instance, honoraria and support to take students to a performance can be received before the event. In such cases, the recipient should arrange with the Fund Administrator to have the money transferred internally to the departmental or sectional account responsible for the actual disbursement of funds. A brief confirmation that the funds have been expended for the purpose for which they were awarded should subsequently be sent to the Director or the Fund Administrator.  Office of the Dean

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.eduThe power of travel 
	An important dimension of the Kelly-Douglas Fund is the support for and encouragement of undergraduate education in the humanities, arts and social sciences. We believe that travel outside MIT to pursue an independent project in a HASS field, or to collaborate in a humanitarian project, can have a powerful and lasting effect on students. To this end, a portion of the Fund is reserved for Traveling Fellowships for MIT pursuing an endeavor of their own devising either during IAP or the Summer.Who can apply?
	All MIT sophomores, juniors, and seniors wishing to travel during IAP or Summer to deepen their understanding of a field in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, or to contribute to a humanitarian project are eligible to apply. Students need not belong to the School of HASS, though majors and minors in the School will be given preference.Please note that first-year students are NOT eligible to apply unless they have already been granted sophomore status at the time of application. Seniors may only apply to travel in the IAP of their final year, and are NOT eligible for grants for the summer following graduation.About the Undergraduate Travel Application Process
	 How much support does the Fund provide?
	The maximum level of support offered by the Fund is $1500. However, since the Board seeks to assist as many students as possible, grants are often for smaller amounts. The grants are competitively awarded: decisions on funding are reached based upon an assessment both of the proposal's intrinsic merit, and the demonstrated financial need. It is expected that students will also seek supplementary funds - either personal or from some other source. All other potential sources need to be disclosed on the application. In the event that a student receives substantial funding from an outside source (such as the Eloranta), he or she will not be considered for a financial award from the Kelly-Douglas Fund.
	 What sorts of activities does the Fund support?
	The Kelly-Douglas Fund has assisted a range of efforts. Students have been awarded grants to carry out archival and library research, or to conduct interview and gather data for independent projects. Others have applied for and received some support to travel abroad to study intensively a language that will be of use in their future careers. The Fund has further supported travel to take courses not available at MIT or to develop skills in the performing arts and music. It has also helped realise humanitarian projects in small communities in Africa and Asia. This list is by no means exhaustive. A list of current winners and a brief description of their projects may be found on the Award Recipients page of this website.  Office of the Dean

	617-253-3450 | shass-www@mit.eduThere are two competitions each year, one for travel during IAP and the other for travel during the Summer.  Download the cover sheet.In addition to contact and student status information, the Cover Sheet requires the following: The Application should describe cogently the nature of the travel proposed, its reasons and goals, as well as provide a summary of the planned itinerary. It should also make clear either its relation to a field in the humanities, arts and social sciences, or — in the case of travel for humanitarian reasons — the desired impact upon the community the student intends to aid. The Application should not exceed two single-spaced typed pages in length, though applicants are permitted to attach brief appendices to the application (should that seem necessary).
	 Students should arrange for a letter of evaluation, addressed to the Fund Director, to be sent to the Fund Administrator. The recommender should be an instructor at MIT who is familiar with the applicant’s work, and can speak to the merits of the proposed project. Please note that applications will not be considered until the supporting letter has been received.

	 Founded in 1776
	“Five students at the College of William & Mary founded Phi Beta Kappa in 1776, during the American Revolution. For over two and a quarter centuries, the Society has embraced the principles of freedom of inquiry and liberty of thought and expression.” It continues to honor the nation’s most outstanding undergraduate students for excellence in the liberal arts and sciences.Best of the Best 
	Only about ten percent of the nation’s institutions of higher education have been selected to have Phi Beta Kappa chapters, and only ten percent or fewer of the students in these schools are selected for Phi Beta Kappa membership.
	 Xi of Massachusetts
	MIT’s own chapter, Xi of Massachusetts, annually elects approximately 75 students in their senior year of undergraduate study. Students do not apply for membership. Election is conducted by a faculty committee, which reviews the academic records of seniors to find students with superlative records and clear evidence of breadth in the liberal arts.
	Several mechanical criteria may be of interest to you in choosing HASS and related subjects. Phi Beta Kappa members must have two years of a foreign language in college, three years in high school, a combination thereof, or be a native speaker of a language other than English. Majors in engineering must show clear evidence of depth and breadth in their selection of HASS and related courses. Generally, members will have more than the required eight HASS courses.
	 The Phi Beta Kappa Induction Ceremony at MITIn early June each year, on the afternoon before MIT’s annual Commencement exercises, our Phi Beta Kappa chapter holds an induction ceremony to honor our newest members in front of their family and friends. The President, Historian, and Guide of our chapter, all MIT Faculty members, preside over this event, which begins with a scholarly lecture by an MIT professor on a topic of broad intellectual interest. Recent speakers have discussed reform of the voting system in the United States, and the size and nature of the physical universe.
	After the lecture, the Historian and Guide provide a brief introduction to the rights and responsibilities of Phi Beta Kappa members. The newest inductees are then individually recognized and asked to sign the official register of the Xi of Massachusetts chapter. They are also taught the Phi Beta Kappa secret handshake, but strict Society regulations prohibit us from revealing its characteristics here!

	  Greetings Students — 
	At MIT, we view the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) as essential, both for educating great engineers, scientists, thinkers, and citizens, and for sustaining the Institute’s capacity for innovation. From this page, you can take a virtual tour through the entire range of MIT's HASS fields of study and discover which options are the most meaningful for your goals. Get started by clicking on the photographs below.
	 EmpoweringAll MIT HASS classes are designed to empower our students to succeed — to serve the world well, with innovations and lives that are rich in meaning and wisdom. In HASS studies and explorations, MIT students gain critical thinking and communication skills, cultural and historical perspectives, fluent language abilities, and knowledge about economic and political forces.
	In addition to the MIT HASS requirement, students can pursue a major and/or a minor in HASS fields, exploring interests that support, balance, or expand studies in MIT's STEM fields. All MIT HASS classes empower professional success, whatever one's major field, and open windows onto a lifetime of creativity and growth.Annual TOUR de SHASS campus fair in September

					Main Number: 617-253-0951
					“Even the very best ideas in science or engineering do not automatically translate into broader economic prosperity. In large measure, the material benefits of innovation spring from complementarities between technology and economics.” — Ben Bernanke, MIT PhD ’79; former Chairman, US Federal Reserve Board Field Office: 14N-305
					Main Number: 617-253-4771
					 
					"These classes opened my eyes to the staggering breadth of human achievement beyond science and engineering, showing that human interaction is as nuanced and fascinating and relevant as any physics model or math proof or computer system."  — Chris Yang SB '08, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science Field Office: E51-255
					Main Number: 617-253-4965
					 
					"Because everything has a past, the discipline of History is, of necessity, a big tent. Over this broad purview the historian's task is to strip away the obscuring layers of myth that accrete with time—and to reveal instead the true richness of the human experience."  — Anne McCants, Professor of History, MacVicar Faculty Fellow Field Office: 32-D808

	 EmpoweringAll MIT HASS classes are designed to empower our students to succeed — to serve the world well, with innovations and lives that are rich in meaning and wisdom. In HASS studies and explorations, MIT students gain critical thinking and communication skills, cultural and historical perspectives, fluent language abilities, and knowledge about economic and political forces.
	In addition to the MIT HASS requirement, students can pursue a major and/or a minor in HASS fields, exploring interests that support, balance, or expand studies in MIT's STEM fields. All MIT HASS classes empower professional success, whatever one's major field, and open windows onto a lifetime of creativity and growth.Annual TOUR de SHASS campus fair in September
