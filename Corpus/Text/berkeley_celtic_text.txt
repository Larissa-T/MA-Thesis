During the SummerOur summer courses are generally open for registration by anyone — not just UC Berkeley students.  We offer a variety of language and culture courses each summer, taught by qualified UCB instructors.  All summer course registration goes through the Berkeley Summer Sessions office, whose website outlines the enrollment process, tuition fees, and more.During the Academic YearWhile we are unable to offer traditional “auditing” or “sitting in on” a Fall or Spring course, the UC Extension makes it possible for non-UC Berkeley students to enroll in UC Berkeley classes through their Concurrent Enrollment program, pending instructor approval.Courses through Concurrent Enrollment can be taken for credit/letter grade, pass/no pass, or no credit; registration costs vary depending on the grading option.  For details on Concurrent Enrollment requirements, deadlines, applications and fees, please visit their web site or call 510-642-4111.For registration purposes, you will need the class number from UC Berkeley’s official online schedule of classes.A few weeks before the class begins, it is important that the potential Concurrent Enrollment student e-mails the instructor of the course to introduce him or herself and informs the instructor of his or her plans.  Course descriptions with instructor names are posted in the Courses section of this web site.  In order to contact our instructors, please see the People page of this website.In general, applications for Concurrent Enrollment are not officially approved and signed by the instructor until the first week of class, as part of the approval is based on the number of spaces available.  Once approved by the instructor, the application will go through an approval process between the UCB campus and the Concurrent Enrollment office, and finally the student will be officially enrolled and billed by the UC Extension.6303 Dwinelle Hall, Berkeley CA 94720-2690 | issa@berkeley.edu | 510-642-2979Celtic R1B, Section 1: Reading & CompositionCeltic R1B, Section 2: Reading and Writing about Modern Irish LiteratureCeltic 15: Elementary Modern IrishCeltic 70: The World of the CeltsCeltic 128: Medieval Celtic CulturesCeltic 144A: Modern Welsh Level IIICeltic 168: Celtic Mythology and Oral Tradition6303 Dwinelle Hall, Berkeley CA 94720-2690 | issa@berkeley.edu | 510-642-2979Elementary Modern Irish4 units

Thomas WalshThis is a beginner’s course. The goal of this course is proficiency in beginning Irish. To that end, we work at a reasonable but solid pace through Ó Dónaill’s book. We will supplement this work with a workbook, Progress in Irish. Students will learn about the history of the language and the basics of Irish grammar. Emphasis will be on pronunciation, and the acquisition of basic vocabulary and idioms. Our highest priority is for students to develop their ability to understand, speak, read and write the language. Simple written stories and conversations in Irish will supplement classroom oral-aural work.Class activities will include conversation and discussion of homework in Irish. At the end of the course students should be able to carry on a basic conversation in Irish, as they use the unique idioms of the language; in addition we will practice reading and writing basic poetry and prose.Student assignments will include regular homework assignments, quizzes, a midterm, and a final.Texts:Gaeilge gan Stró!

Annalee RejhonL&S Breadth: Historical Studies OR Social & Behavioral SciencesA study of medieval Celtic culture as it is reflected in Irish and Welsh texts ranging from literary works to law tracts and historical chronicles.  The course examines the sweep of medieval Celtic culture, beginning with its pre-history and extending to the thirteenth century, but with a focus on the last centuries of that time frame; it will examine how Celtic culture fared in the face of Anglo-Norman incursions and will briefly study how Celtic material became a major source for European literature.  The works for Irish include the pseudo-historical Book of Invasions, the Testimony of Morann, the Bee Laws, tales from the Finn Cycle, and Gerald of Wales’ History and Topography of Ireland.  For Wales, texts include the Gododdin, Culhwch and Olwen, the Chronicle of the Princes (extracts), the Laws of Hywel Dda, and Gerald of Wales’ Description of Wales.  Irish, Welsh, and Norse versions of the Tristan legend will also be read.  All texts will be available in English translation.Course requirements include a midterm and final examination.Texts:

Annalee RejhonL&S Breadth:  Philosophy & Values OR Arts & LiteratureThe course will examine the mythology of the Celts—their gods, goddesses, festivals, and belief systems—as it is reflected in medieval Irish and Welsh texts.  Following a short presentation of introductory material regarding the history and civilization of the early Celts, the course will begin with the early Irish tale known as The Second Battle of Maige Tuired, a core mythological tale that best exemplifies the pattern of mythological deities and belief systems that pertain to varying degrees in other Celtic tales.  These tales will include in Irish, the Destruction of Da Derga’s Hostel, the Tale of Macc Da Thó’s Pig, Bricriu’s Feast, the Wooing of Etaín, the Dream of Oengus, the Wasting Sickness of CúChulaind, the Cattle Raid of Fróech, and the Táin, and in Welsh, the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, Culhwch and Olwen, Lludd and Llefelys, the Tale of Gwion Bach and the Tale of Taliesin, and the poems,  “What Man the Gatekeeper” and  “The Spoils of the Otherworld.”  All the readings are in English translation.Course requirements include a midterm and final examination. Prerequisites: none.6303 Dwinelle Hall, Berkeley CA 94720-2690 | issa@berkeley.edu | 510-642-2979The World of the Celts4 units

Daniel MeliaL&S Breadth: Historical Studies OR Social and Behavioral SciencesDid the Druids really burn people in giant wicker statues? Did they worship a mother goddess? Did they worship trees? Did the Celts build Stonehenge? Was Britain Rome’s Vietnam? Who are the Celts anyway (or were they Kelts?) Who was King Arthur (was there really a King Arthur?)Celtic Studies 70 is designed to allow you to be able to answer these and other questions about the Celtic world of the past and the present. The course will present an overview of the history of the Celtic speaking peoples from Indo European times to the present concentrating particularly on questions of assessing evidence. How are we to interpret Roman or Greek views of the Celts? How do we know about languages of which there are no written records? We will discuss the extent to which Celtic culture can be seen as a unitary phenomenon at various periods. The course will cover what we know and what we may be able to reconstruct of Celtic belief systems and social structure. For the later historical period we will discuss Celtic tribal migration, cultural absorption, and linguistic fragmentation.Course requirements:

Thomas WalshThis course satisfies the second half or the “B” portion of the Reading and Composition requirement for the Bachelor’s Degree.
The primary focus of this course is the improvement of your writing. Since R1B is an intensive college writing course, issues of development and style are presented at an advanced level. Further, students are to receive attention to their writing through detailed comments on their essays and through discussion in class and during office hours.Your writing for this course will analyze and interpret significant dramatic and poetic texts from Ireland and Greece. The reason for this pairing has to do with the Irish dramatists’ engagement with material from ancient Greece, as well as with singular place of Greek drama in the universe of theatrical performance. Thus, we will read Irish dramatic texts alongside some Greek tragedies in order to explore and come to terms with how dramatic literature works. Of importance to our reading are: 1.) the development of Irish drama in its historical context; 2.) The development of Greek drama; 3.) the place of Irish drama as a response to Greek drama; and 4.) the dramatic artistry of the plays themselves. Of special interest to our reading will be the way that varieties of performance can be read out of a single script.Our topics will include: politics, education, selfhood, lying, and representation.Your work in 1B includes a library research project developed during the term with the assistance of UC librarians. This project will be the “capstone” to your essays on the plays that we will read.Required Texts:

(Harvard has the only such program in the U.S.) However, the Berkeley campus has a varied and high-quality set of resources in the area of Celtic Studies, focused around our undergraduate Celtic Studies Program. Many graduate students take advantage of these resources while earning graduate degrees in departments such as English, Linguistics, History, Comparative Literature, or Anthropology (our Anthropology Department has a Folklore Program). For example, you could do a Comparative Literature degree with one or more Celtic Languages among your chosen language areas; you could do an Anthropology or Linguistics degree with your chosen area being a Celtic culture or language(s); and so on. You would naturally have access to our Celtic language and culture courses in making up your curriculum in one of these departments. Members of the Celtic Studies faculty could serve on your doctoral dissertation committee in one of these departments. It is also possible to combine a Ph.D. program in any of these departments with Medieval Studies to obtain a joint degree. (More information is available from the Medieval Studies Program.)What department might be appropriate for you? Two sets of criteria are important. First, what departments are likely to accept you – if you are qualified in literature rather than in anthropology, then a literature department is naturally a better bet than Anthropology. Second, what departments fit your needs? Do you want to do the courses they require? Do they have faculty who excite you, and who work in areas that interest you? (If you’re a medievalist, do they have medievalists? and so on.) You will need to talk to the advisors in specific departments, as well as study relevant websites and other information about application and Ph.D. work in those departments, in order to judge where to apply. Remember that few departments would be motivated to take an applicant who frankly admits that this admission is really just a pretext for studying something else – and they will not change their course requirements just for you. So be ready to fulfill those requirements and profit from them, if you ask for admission; and be sure to indicate real interest in that department for itself, and to explain how your Celtic work fits into your work in their program.Footnote: It is also possible to have a personally tailored Ph.D. program at Berkeley; that is, you can set up your own program, independent of specific departments. However, one must first be admitted to some extant graduate program at Berkeley before proposing an independent program. Further, it is quite difficult to get such a program approved (in other words, you cannot come here counting on this option being available to you.) So on all counts, it is important to apply to an appropriate department or program, one which offers you the kinds of training you actually want to acquire. The Program in Celtic Studies will then be able to offer you its resources as you work in that home program.If you are interested in pursuing a graduate degree that incorporates Celtic Studies, please contact the current program director listed on the Faculty page.Eve Sweetser, Professor of Linguistics and Celtic Studies6303 Dwinelle Hall, Berkeley CA 94720-2690 | issa@berkeley.edu | 510-642-2979
