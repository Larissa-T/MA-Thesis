          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Ph.D. Program in Portuguese and Brazilian is advanced graduate study in the language, literatures and cultures of the Portuguese-Speaking World, with concentration on one or more the following areas: Continental and Insular Portugal, Brazil, Lusophone Africa, and Luso-America. The program has an outstanding placement record for its graduates.Students enrolled in this program are able to take advantage of the diverse expertise of the Department's faculty, which embraces specializations in Literature, Language, Philosophy, Comparative Literature, History, Ethnic and Cross-Cultural Studies, Anthropology, Judaic Studies, and Bilingual Education.It is the Department's philosophy that all students should grasp the global nature of the Portuguese-Speaking World and study its language, literatures, and cultures as well as apply the tools of research and scholarship to their individual programs of study. While this doctoral program will allow for an interdisciplinary component, the emphasis of the core program will be in the Portuguese language and Luso-Brazilian literature and culture.The standard route to the Ph.D. is the successful completion of sixteen courses, a general examination (second year), a preliminary examination (third year), a pre-dissertation colloquium, and a dissertation. The expected route toward the Ph.D. follows this pattern of landmarks:Graduate work completed at other institutions and not used in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy elsewhere may, on the recommendation of the Department, be counted towards the fulfillment of the three-year residence requirement (reducing the number of years of full tuition). A student who desires credit for work done elsewhere should file an application after completing one semester at Brown. Forms are available in the Office of the Registrar. No more than the equivalent of one full year of graduate study may be counted towards the three-year residence requirement.Students who enter our doctoral program in possession of a master's degree in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies or a related field are urged to request a reduction of the three-year residence (tuition) requirement to two years. Reduction of the residence requirement does not affect the number of courses students may take for credit. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Department recognizes that doctoral students in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies have varied interests and therefore it encourages each student to construct his or her individualized program in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. Nevertheless, the Department also finds it necessary to provide students with guidance regarding our overall expectations for course load and distribution across the various regions of the Portuguese-speaking world and different historical periods.Students will complete a minimum of sixteen courses, two of which may be independent studies.Brazilian and Portuguese History/Culture is understood here in a broad sense. In addition to the courses offered by the two historians in the department, such courses as "Portuguese Culture and National Identity" (Almeida), "Afro-Brazilians and the Brazilian Polity" (Dzidzienyo) and "The Brazilian Puzzle: Confronting the Postcolonial Legacy" (Valente), among others, would satisfy requirement (6).A four-hour written examination (half of it in English and half of it in Portuguese) covering a reading list of twenty basic works in the field. Students are expected to take this examination during their third semester in residence. Sample questions are available from the Director of Graduate Studies.A two-day (three hours per day) written, in-depth examination on two broadly defined areas, developed by the student in consultation with a committee made up of at least three faculty members. The committee should include faculty members who are not only familiar with the candidate's work but whose research expertise and teaching interests most closely match the topics presented by the candidate.The preliminary examination is normally held at the conclusion of the student's coursework (third year). In consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies, students should form their prelim committees and start developing their prelim areas by the end of their second year. During the preparation period for their prelims, students should meet regularly with all committee members to discuss their chosen areas, review reading lists, and plan the details of the exam.Proposals for the preliminary examination include three-page narratives conceptualizing each area and a bibliography of primary and secondary materials. Final copies of the proposals must be filed with the committee at least two weeks before the scheduled date for the examination. Students are encouraged to examine copies of previously submitted proposals, which are available from the Director of Graduate Studies and are also kept in a folder in the graduate students' lounge.The content of the preliminary examination will vary, depending on each student's program, with the stipulation that half of the exam will be written in Portuguese and half in English. The exam will be prepared and evaluated by each student's committee. A decision on the candidate's performance on the exam must be given within two weeks.Upon completion of the preliminary examination, students are officially advanced to candidacy (ABD) and qualify for a Master of Arts degree in course.A public oral presentation and discussion of the student's dissertation proposal, open to all faculty and graduate students in the Department, normally to be given within the semester following the preliminary examination. The colloquium consists of a twenty-to-thirty-minute presentation by the candidate followed by a discussion with the members of the dissertation committee (see below under "Dissertation"). Copies of the proposal will be made available to interested faculty members and graduate students at least one week before the scheduled date for the colloquium. Please contact the department manager, Ms. Armanda Silva for scheduling.The dissertation proposal consists of the following components:Students are encouraged to consult copies of previously accepted dissertation proposals, which are available from the Director of Graduate Studies and kept in a folder in the graduate students' lounge.Ph.D. candidates will be expected to have achieved native or near-native fluency in Portuguese. In addition, candidates should demonstrate reading ability in a second foreign language, which normally will be French, Spanish, Italian or German.Ph.D. candidates are expected to acquire sound pedagogical skills by participating in the department's teaching-mentoring program (see below).The department sponsors a lively program of lectures, symposia, conferences and occasional concerts, designed to enrich the experience of our students and to complement our classes and seminars. Doctoral students are expected to participate actively in the scholarly life of the department by attending and, whenever applicable, participating in the organization of such events.The dissertation is expected to make an original contribution to the field of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies, consistent with the high research and scholarship standards of the Department. The dissertation may be written in English or in Portuguese. The final copy of the dissertation must strictly follow the guidelines issued by the Graduate School.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe Graduate School guarantees five years of financial support for doctoral students in good academic standing, who, in the judgment of the department's faculty, are making the expected progress towards the completion of their degree. Continued support is contingent upon the timely completion of such landmarks as the general examination (third semester), the preliminary examination (no later than the end of the sixth semester) and the colloquium (no later than the end of the seventh semester). Though not guaranteed, sixth-year support it generally available to students who are making steady progress towards the completion of their degrees, and have submitted chapters of their dissertations during the fifth year. Sixth-year support is normally in the form of a teaching assistantship.For the first year financial aid is generally in the form of a university fellowship, covering tuition for eight courses, a monthly stipend and the health fee. Support for the second, third and fourth years are usually in the form of a teaching assistantship, teaching fellowship or a proctorship, covering tuition, a monthly stipend and the health fee. When students serve as Teaching Assistants, Teaching Fellows or Proctors, they are allowed to enroll in only three courses per semester.Students serving as teaching assistants and teaching fellows are required to participate in orientation programs sponsored by the Center for Language Studies and the Department beginning about a week before the start of fall semester classes. They are also required to participate in an organizational meeting with the department's language coordinator before the start of the spring semester. As such, they should plan their return from summer and winter breaks accordingly.   Teaching fellows, teaching assistants and proctors must seek advance permission from their supervisors for extended absences from campus while classes are in session and during the exam period. In planning their summer travel, students should bear in mind that such appointments cover the academic year through May.Although we are committed to providing different types of teaching and research opportunities for all students, the assignment of teaching assistants, teaching fellows and proctors must also take into account the needs of the Department in a given semester.Since financial support for the fifth year normally consists of a dissertation fellowship, it is essential that students submit their dissertation proposals no later than the end of their seventh semester.If needed, the Department will also assist students who are making steady progress towards the completion of their PhD in securing support for the sixth year.In addition to academic year fellowships, assistantships and proctorships, the Graduate School guarantees support for a minimum of three summers during each doctoral student's career at Brown. Students choose the three summers during which they would like to be supported by the Graduate School.The Department encourages and provides guidance for students to apply for outside fellowships either for academic year or summer support. Thanks to the continued generosity of the Belda Family, the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies is now able to offer fellowships to support research trips to Brazil by our doctoral candidates. Priority is given to students who have completed their preliminary examination and been advanced to candidacy.   Interested students should submit a proposal consisting of a two-page narrative, the dates when they plan to use their fellowship and a budget by April 1. Awards are based upon the significance and soundness of the project and its relevancy to the student's research.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownOur Department is a community of individuals committed to the highest standards in teaching and scholarship in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies. Doctoral students are an integral part of this community. Working closely with supportive faculty members as mentors, doctoral students are encouraged to develop research and pedagogical skills that will prepare them for careers as outstanding teachers and scholars. Besides regular meetings with the Director of Graduate Studies, doctoral students are urged to meet with other departmental faculty to discuss their research and pedagogical interests.In addition to advice on the research and preparation of term papers, from early on in their graduate studies our doctoral students receive guidance on how to convert their course papers into conference presentations and/or journal articles. Doctoral students are also offered the opportunity to partner with faculty members in research projects, the design of undergraduate courses, the planning of academic conferences and symposia, and the publication of our two scholarly journals, Gávea-Brown and Brasil/Brazil.It is the Department's philosophy that teaching and research go hand in hand and are mutually enriching. Our commitment to teaching is reflected in the multiple educational programs of instruction and teacher training supported by the Department and included as part of its curricular offerings and as a service to the surrounding community. The Master's program in Cross-Cultural Education, co-sponsored by the Education Alliance, is a testimony to this pedagogical position and may serve as a methodological and material resource for our students. Furthermore, the emphasis on language in both our undergraduate and graduate programs rests on our belief that the acquisition of a foreign/second language contributes to what Pierre Bourdieu calls the expansion of one's cultural capital in a material, cultural, and symbolic sense. The conviction that language and culture are facets of the same process and cannot be separated permeates all aspects of our graduate program –– courses, research, examinations, and extra-curricular activities. Doctoral students emerge from our program with linguistic expertise as well as mastery of foreign language pedagogy, in addition to sound research skills. Such combination has proven to be highly attractive to universities seeking junior faculty to fill positions in foreign language, literature and cultural studies, as attested by our very successful record in placing the graduates from our Ph.D. program.Our doctoral students participate in a mentoring program designed to pass the Department's pedagogical legacy in foreign language, literature and culture on to them while enhancing their teaching skills. According to our longstanding practice, from the very beginning we impart to our doctoral students the belief that immersion in and constant use of Portuguese as the target language, following the principles of a communicative and natural approach, represent crucial steps in the acquisition of a second/foreign language. Furthermore, through both orientation and hands-on experience, our doctoral students quickly learn that foreign/second languages are to be used as media of instruction and not as ends in themselves (such as the traditional objective of solely mastering grammar skills).The teaching mentoring program consists of a series of steps designed to acquaint our students with various pedagogical approaches and methodologies, while also exposing them to different instructional experiences and course formats:1. Intensive group orientation before the start of each academic year, consisting of a packet of readings in methodology and applied linguistics as well as an in-house seminar with members of the Department's faculty, culminating in a mock practice teaching session.2. For each new course that a graduate student will teach or co-teach, an orientation session specific to the goals of each course will be offered prior to the beginning of each semester.3. In addition to this basic preparation, there will be group and/or individual meetings throughout the semester between teaching assistants/fellows and the faculty member(s) in charge of teacher training, as well as class visitations followed by a discussion between the graduate student and the evaluator. Doctoral students will receive guidance on how to plan lessons, develop a course syllabus, design and grade exams and assignments, etc.The following courses have been earmarked for the teaching-mentoring program:POBS 100-200: Elementary Portuguese – A yearlong course for students with little or no preparation in the Portuguese language. Stress upon fundamental language skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Aspects of Portuguese and Brazilian culture are also presented. Method: situational/natural approach.POBS 110: Intensive Portuguese – Designed for students with little or no preparation in the Portuguese language, it covers the same amount of material as PB10-20 in just one semester. Stress upon fundamental language skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Aspects of Portuguese and Brazilian culture are also presented. Method: situational/natural approach.POBS 400: Writing and Speaking Portuguese – Designed to improve the student's ability in contemporary spoken and written Portuguese, using such cultural items as short stories, plays, films, videos, newspaper and magazine articles, and popular music. Method: situational/natural approach.POBS 610/620: Mapping Portuguese-Speaking Cultures – Selected literary and cultural texts that serve as vehicles for a deeper understanding of Portuguese-speaking societies. Literary materials are taken from several genres and periods with special attention to contemporary writings. Other media such as film and music are also included. Considerable emphasis on strengthening speaking and writing skills.Graduate students will normally progress from co-teaching with a regular faculty member (generally in POBS 110 and/or POBS 400) to teaching their own courses (generally POBS 100-200 and/or POBS 400) under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Whenever possible graduate students will be given the opportunity to teach a module of one of the introduction to literature courses (POBS 610 and/or POBS 620) and, in some cases, to teach such courses on their own.In addition to the training they receive in the department, students are encouraged to enroll in the Sheridan Center's teaching certificate program, which provides pedagogical and professional training in the form of methodologies, approaches and techniques. The Center also offers invaluable help in the preparation of CVs, narrative profiles on teaching philosophy and teaching portfolios. Students should check the Sheridan Center website for more details.Depending upon the research and pedagogical interests of individual students, there are also opportunities to teach and conduct research in local public schools as well as to serve as an intern with the Educational Alliance, a Brown unit charged to conduct applied research on educational reform and cultural diversity.When doctoral students first arrive on campus, they meet with the Director of Graduate Studies, who explains the doctoral program to them in detail and guides them in their initial selection of courses. At the end of the first semester, each student's academic performance during the preceding semester and progress towards the completion of the degree are assessed by the Department's faculty. This evaluation is transmitted to students at individual meetings with the DGS. This process occurs every semester of the student's graduate experience at Brown. In addition, students will receive a written assessment of their performance and progress towards the degree at the close of each academic year in accordance with Graduate School regulations. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownProfessor Patricia I. SobralDirector of Undergraduate StudiesThe undergraduate program in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies is interdisciplinary in nature and allows students to work with core faculty in the department and in related fields. Since language is the key to culture and the more in-depth study of the Portuguese-speaking world in all of its diversity, the foundation of the undergraduate experience is centered on interdisciplinary arts-based learning approaches. On any given week, students from all levels could be working with digital narratives, creative writing, intense literary analysis, performances, the making of micro-documentaries and visual arts projects.Another key element to the program is the Clube da escrita, an in-department writing center in which consultants work with each student individually.At the end of each semester, as a means of honoring student work and sharing with a larger community, undergraduates from all courses perform or show their work at Performance and Exhibit evening. The evening highlights the quality of undergraduate work in the program and underscores the importance of community.Due to the intensive nature of Portuguese language instruction offered by the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies and to the opportunities for study in Brazil and in Portugal, it is possible for students to start Portuguese at Brown and still be able to become concentrators. In fact, many Portuguese and Brazilian Studies concentrators begin studying Portuguese as freshmen or sophomores.Additionally, the undergraduate experience in the department is shaped by the lively and active participation of students from concentration programs throughout the university. Many students who ultimately decide to concentrate in other departments choose to integrate Portuguese into their courses of study and continue to take courses or develop projects related to Portuguese and Brazilian Studies. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownProfessor Patricia I. SobralDirector of Undergraduate StudiesThe concentration in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies is the study of  the Portuguese-speaking world, a large and diverse geographical and  cultural area spread over five continents, including Brazil, Continental  and Insular Portugal, Lusophone Africa and Luso-America, and inhabited  by two hundred million people. Although students are encouraged to  explore the global nature of the Portuguese-speaking world, their  individual program will generally focus on one of the specific  geographical areas mentioned above.Using the Portuguese language as a basis, the concentration in  Portuguese and Brazilian Studies allows students to develop their  interests in the areas of language, literature, education, history and  the social sciences. The concentration consists of eight interrelated  courses to be selected by the student, in consultation with the Director  of Undergraduate Studies, from the offerings in Portuguese and  Brazilian Studies as well as in other departments, such as History,  Political Science, Afro-American Studies, Anthropology and Sociology. The prerequisite for the concentration is POBS 0400 or the equivalent; however, these prerequisites do not count toward the 8 concentration requirements.Beyond introductory language courses, concentration requirements for Portuguese and Brazilian Studies consist of the following courses:Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownProfessor Onésimo T. AlmeidaDirector of the Undergraduate Honors ProgramCandidacy for honors in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies assumes a  better than average record, particularly in the concentration. Students  interested in pursuing honors should make their intention known to the  Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Director of the Undergraduate  Honors Program early as possible. Candidates for honors are required to  complete an honors thesis or other approved project.In consultation with the other pertinent faculty, a topic will be  selected and a thesis advisor and second reader will be chosen.  Candidates for honors will normally register for POBS 0193/0194 ("Research  and Preparation of Honors Projects") in Semesters VII and VIII, but  these independent study units may not be used to satisfy the minimum  course requirement for the concentration.No later than the third week of Semester VII, a candidate for  honors will submit a proposal for approval by the thesis advisor and  second reader. It is expected that the student will meet regularly with  his/her advisor(s) throughout the semester. At the end of Semester VII a  report on the project should be submitted in writing by the student,  signed by the thesis advisor(s) and filed with the concentration  advisor.The project must be completed in time for the readers to evaluate  it and for possible corrections to be made before a final copy is  submitted. Therefore, for students completing requirements for  graduation in Semester I, the project should be submitted by December 1.  For students completing requirements for graduation in Semester II, the  project should be submitted by April 22. An oral presentation/defense  of the project will follow.A final copy prepared according to a format approved by the  Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies should be submitted by  January 10 for students completing requirements in Semester I and by May  10 for students completing requirements in Semester II.Honors candidates are encouraged to examine the copies of past  honors projects on file at the Department of Portuguese and Brazilian  Studies.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@BrownThe following projects have been supported by the Scarritt Fund:An investigation of Rio de Janeiro's NGOs that teach dance,  film, theater, digital production, and other arts to young people from  Rio's poorest and most violent neighborhoods with the goal of assessing  how dynamic artist expression , often viewed as an apolitical luxury of  the First World, may play a central role in development. This research  resulted into an honors thesis in Development Studies presented in  December'07.An examination of public opinion and popular responses to the  violence that currently plagues the city of Rio de Janeiro through a  series of interviews with academics, NGO leaders and the Commission on  Human Rights of the Order of Brazilian Lawyers (OAB). This research  became part of an honors thesis in Latin American Studies presented in  May'08.Internship with the "Cinema Nosso" NGO in Rio de Janeiro, which  uses film to connect poor urban youth to training in media skills and  access to the arts job market.Through collaboration with the Brazilian NGO Cinema Nosso, Hope  High School and Brown University, Harrison and Yarbrough will develop a  series of workshops to provide basic technical skills in audio-visual  work to at-risk youth in Rio de Janeiro while exploring storytelling  through film as a method for engaging and empowering them to pursue  their own social and educational development. The ultimate goal is to  produce a documentary based on Cinema Nosso's impact on their lives.Travelled to Rio de Janeiro in January 2009 in order to try her  hand  as a freelance journalist.

Joshua worked directly with the Conectas  exchange program, while also pursuing research  of his own design,  presented as a culmination of his internship project.Participated in an engineering  internships with  Metalfran, a company in Volta Reddonda, Brazil, which  specializes in making  structures from metal, aluminum, steel and glass  for such companies and  Peugeot, Volkswagen and regional Brazilian  hotels. Francisco worked directly  with the CEO, helping plan, budget  and organize projects, while also assisting  with the manufacturing of  products. He aso observed other fields of engineering  at a local  technical school.Travelled to Salvador and Rio  de Janeiro with the  African-American Baptist Church of Brown University as  neutral  observers to Brazilian culture and society. They observed how ethnic  diversity within the community, and differences in religion  and culture  have resulted in differential development of the community. Interacted  with communities of different faiths (Baptist, Candomble, Umbanda,  Catholic, etc.) and investigated contemporary racial  definition  conditions within religious  institutions. Their work included visiting  religious institutions such  as Rosário dos Pretos, Igreja de Batista de  Garça de Esperanca, Igreja Universal do  Reino de Deus, Igreja Batista  de Itapoã, Igreja de Batista de Ipanema and cultural events such as the  Lavagem do  Bonfim.Spent  three months in Rio de Janeiro interning with Catalytic  Communities, a  nonprofit that works to train, assist, and advocate for  community leaders and  entrepreneurs within the city's favelas, and  reported his observations on  the RioOnWatch website. Traveled to Brazil in order to conduct research for her honors thesis, which focuses on the personal narrative of Maria Auxiliadora Lara Barcelos (known as Dora), a guerilla fighter and activist during the military regime (1964-1985), as a way to understand the complexities of the resistance against the regime. The investigation centers on two questions: What does Maria Auxiliadora’s story say about the guerilla resistance in the 1960s-1980s? What are the implications of Brazil’s Truth Commission for the role and memory of the guerilla movement?Internship at a media production company called Giros, under the supervision of Brown alumnus Adam Stepan'89. His main project there, done in conjunction with the Columbia University Global Center in Rio de Janeiro, was to develop the online (and video) components to a hybrid educational program that would allow professors from Columbia's School for International and Public Administration (SIPA) to train Brazilian public servants. In addition, I contributed to a market study of the Brazilian public sector that demonstrated the need for such a program in Brazil.Spent the summer of 2013 in. the city of Altamira, Pará where she conducted sociological research on the relationship between the construction of the Belo Monte dam and the Altamira fishing community as part of a group led by Professor Leah Van Wey.As part of his honors thesis research, Mateus spent the summer of 2013 in Brazil interviewing people involved with the Instituto Liberal. The institute began in the late 1970s by Brazilian businessman named Donald Stewart. He was interested in the ways that the institute assisted in dissemination neoliberal policies throughout Brazil. He also established contact with professors at the University of São Paulo for further discussions on the intersection of neoliberal economic policies and US foreign policy.Traveled to Brazil during the 2014 winter break to conduct research for her honors thesis, in which she analyzes the historical role that the circus played in the formation and evolution of Brazil’s cultural identity. As a circus performer herself, she had always been fascinated with anything and everything circus-related. At age sixteen, she embarked on a trip to South America where she spent two months training at a circus school in Chile. There she reflected for the first time on the larger cultural significance of the circus in South America.Spent three weeks in Rio de Janeiro three weeks in the summer of 2014, working closely with the Arruda family to conduct interviews, collect footage, and digitize photographs in order to document their lives during the 1964-1985 military regime. Their story was one of loss and exile, but also of tireless resistance and political activism. One of the family members, Marcos, was arrested and tortured in 1970 by the regime after having joined the clandestine resistance movement, Ação Popular. In 1971, he was able to escape to the U.S., where he continued his work to fight political oppression (he now lives in Rio). His younger siblings, Mônica, Martinha, and Miguel, also became committed to the struggle for democratization, and from them she learned about the role of women in the resistance, the emergence of the arts as an important place to criticize the regime, the effects of political repression, and the legacy of the dictatorship in terms of current economic inequality in Brazil. The memoir that Marcos Arruda and his mother wrote, titled A Mother’s Cry, is the only account of torture written by Brazilians that has been published in English. For this reason, it is especially important to make sure their story lives on. She completed post-production editing by December 2014.Traveled to Brazil to conduct research for her thesis on accountability and transparency in Brazilian governance. She met with public civil servants, academic researchers, and civil society actors. She connected especially well with two researchers with whom she worked on an article about the Law of Access to Information.Traveled to São Paulo during the winter 2015 break to conduct research for her honors thesis in Comparative Literature, part of which focuses on Michel Laub’s recent novel, Diário da Queda. The novel grapples with questions of memory in contemporary Brazil, also investigating the way in which the Holocaust and Alzheimer’s disease complicate the stakes of memory. She met with Mr. Laub and connected with professors in Comparative and Contemporary Literature, Memory Studies and Jewish studies.Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown(PUC-Rio de Janeiro)Professor Luiz F. Valente, Director One of the original Brown-sponsored foreign study programs, the Brown-in-Brazil Program was established in 1984 and was located at the Federal University of Bahia until 1990.   In the fall of 1991, it moved to the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RIO),  the oldest private institution of higher learning in Brazil  and one of  the top five Brazilian universities. Although adjustments are   constantly being made in response to changing student needs, the Brown-in-Brazil Program has retained its  unique features:The program is designed  for students who have the equivalent of at  least three semesters of language  instruction, preferably POBS 0110 and POBS 0400, plus at least one  related course on Brazil in  another discipline, such as Literature, History,  Political Science,  Sociology, Development Studies, Africana Studies, etc.Although the Brown-in-Brazil Program was originally   designed for Brown undergraduates, it is open to students from other   universities. In the past the program has welcomed students from the  following  universities: Colorado, Columbia, Connecticut College,  Cornell, Duke, Harvard, Johns  Hopkins, Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, Notre Dame,  Pennsylvania, Princeton, Smith,  Tulane, Vanderbilt, Vassar, Virginia,  Washington, Wesleyan, and Yale. Students participating in  the Brown-in-Brazil Program have the   option of spending the fall semester (August 1-December 15) or the  full  academic year (July 1-June 30) at PUC-Rio.The fall semester is  preceded by a mandatory five-week, intensive orientation session (July 1-Aug 7), which is included in the  semester tuition at no additional cost.  The orientation session includes  two modules: During  the academic semester(s) Brown-in-Brazil students  enroll in a maximum of four courses, to be chosen from the offerings  of  any unit of the university, provided that the appropriate prerequisites  can  be met. One of the courses may be replaced by an independent  study. For Brown  students these independent studies generally take the  shape of a "Global  Independent Study Project" or GLISP.  Upon completion of the academic program, students are issued an  official  transcript documenting their work at PUC. Normally students  are able to  transfer up to the equivalent of four Brown courses per  semester for  participation in the program.Additional trips as well  as other program-specific events take  place at various points in the academic  semester. Among them is a  dinner in early August with representatives from  various organizations  for the purpose of assisting participants in possibly  securing unpaid  internships or opportunities for volunteer work.Participants are housed  with local families. Although it is  preferred that they will stay with their  host families for the duration  of the program, students are allowed to make  alternative housing  arrangements, such as apartments, after the first two  months. All  housing changes must be approved by the local coordinator and  students  must give their host families proper notice. Students from other   universities who are participating in the program may need to secure  permission  from their home institutions to move into apartments.The program is supervised  by the Brown campus Director,  Professor Luiz F. Valente, and by the local Coordinator  at PUC-Rio,  Professor Karl Erik Schøllhammer.The Brown-in-Brazil Program was created by the  Department of Portuguese  and Brazilian Studies, which continues to have  close involvement with its  operation. The Brown-in-Brazil Program is the only program in Brazil supported by the Department of Portuguese and  Brazilian Studies.The  deadline for applications to the Brown-in-Brazil Program is March 1.For more information about the Brown-in-Brazil Program, please contact Professor Valente or visit the Office for International Programs. Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
