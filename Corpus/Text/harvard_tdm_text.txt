    Not necessarily.  With the exception of concentration tutorials (TDM 97, 98, 99), which are required of all and limited to concentrators, it is up to each instructor to determine enrollment.  However, it is a good idea for students to let instructors know that they are concentrating in TDM.  Some classes, especially studio classes, are highly popular and therefore it is wise to consider several different options during shopping period.

No group is more sought after at Harvard than skilled theater/dance designers and technicians. There are multiple courses here that will hone your skills and lead you to understand the importance of stage craft and design.Courses in VES, TDM, and Computer Science will offer you the opportunity to investigate this provocative intersection.What did Lin-Manuel Miranda study anyway?  Why not take a course on the history of modern drama, and then explore American musicals, or a course on Hiphop or African American theater.There are a number of dance/movement classes, both credit and non-credit, in which non-dancers are encouraged to participate, to add their perspective, to gain experience about the awesome instrument we all have the privilege of occupying from birth to death.  
	Consider enrolling in a dance composition course, or a course on Avant-Garde Theater, in which dance has played a significant role, or take on course on dance in cultural context, a beginning acting course, or experiment with devised theater.
