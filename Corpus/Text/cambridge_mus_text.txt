Faculty of MusicStudying at CambridgeA Cambridge degree in Music doesn’t tie you into a career in music though it is a very good basis for one. Whilst many do go into careers that are connected to the music industry, many choose careers not connected with music at all.The list below shows the huge variety of careers that have been followed by Cambridge University Music graduates.Music careersUnsurprisingly, many Cambridge Music graduates go on to perform as soloists or conductors at the highest level. There are too many of these to list individually, but they include: Key Skills >>

Some choose to study an area related to their first degree such as composition or musicology, and a significant number go on to a music college or conservatoire where they are able to specialize in areas such as music performance or conducting. Several students each year go into teaching, either in a school or as an instrumental or vocal teacher.Postgraduate courses at the Faculty of Music >>

See Funding Graduate Study for information on costs and links to the University’s graduate funding pages. Please note that, if you specialise in Performance studies and choose the recital option, you will need to take vocal or instrumental lessons with an approved teacher, for which we recommend that you budget a further £1,200. Students specialising in Ethnomusicology may opt to carry out fieldwork, in which case you are strongly advised to make an additional financial provision of up to £1,000.  Small grants may be available to support these costs, but they cannot be relied upon to meet the total cost of lessons or fieldwork expenses.Application deadlines are earlier for those students applying for funding.Applications must be made online and details of How to Apply can be found here. Please include a sample of your recent written work (c. 3,000, and no more than 5,000 words in total). Please also submit a summary in approximately 250 words of your proposed dissertation or extended essay topic.Applicants who wish to specialise in Performance studies with the recital option should additionally include one or more audio recordings featuring a range of repertoire lasting approximately 60 minutes in total. Audio recordings cannot be uploaded through the online application system, but should be submitted directly to the Faculty through Dropbox, by sharing files with graduate.applications@mus.cam.ac.uk.Applicants wishing to specialise in Composition are asked to submit:If you live near Cambridge you may be invited to an interview; if you live elsewhere in the UK or abroad we can usually conduct an interview using Skype or by phone if necessary.Further details of graduate life at Cambridge may be found on the University’s Student Registry website.

At the national level, the AHRC offers studentships that are open to both UK and other EU applicants, and cover tuition and maintenance costs (tuition only for non-UK applicants); applications are made through the University and we can help you with this. Click here for further information on the AHRC.There are also various schemes specifically to support study at Cambridge. For UK and EU doctoral students there is the Cambridge Home/EU Studentships Scheme (CHESS). For students from outside the UK, the Gates Cambridge Trust offers full-cost support for all graduate degrees, while the Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trusts offer partial support for Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth students respectively, again at all levels. Finally the Cambridge International Scholarships Scheme (CISS) offers full-cost support for doctoral students from outside the UK.Details of these and a number of other funding opportunities are available on the Graduate Admissions web pages. The Student Registry website includes an introduction to costs and funding and an overview of funding opportunities, with links to separate funding guides for UK, EU, and overseas students. Note that some of these schemes have quite early deadlines (for example October for the Gates Cambridge Trust), so you should begin researching funding opportunities at least a year before you intend to begin your course.

The final deadline for applicants seeking funding is 4 January 2018, but earlier deadlines will apply (for example if you are an overseas applicant from outside the EU). Even if you are not seeking funding, we strongly recommend that you submit your application by 4 January, as no applications will be accepted once programmes are full.  If places are still available on programmes beyond this deadline, self-funded applicants will continue to be considered until the final deadline of 31 May 2018.After submitting your online application form, there may be a delay of up to 48 hours before you are able to access your self-service account and submit supporting documentation.The instructions include a list of the supporting documents you will need to include with your application, such as transcripts and references. In addition to these, be sure to include the materials specified on the page for the programme for which you are applying (M.Phil., M.Mus., or Ph.D.). You do not need to include a CV with your application unless you are applying to specialise in composition on the M.Phil course.The three main criteria for acceptance are:If a prospective supervisor is available, she or he is asked to produce an assessment of the application for the Graduate Committee. If this is negative the application will usually be declined; if positive, the applicant (if resident in this country) is invited for interview by the prospective supervisor and another senior Faculty member, who will report back to the Graduate Committee recommending acceptance or rejection. You will be informed of the outcome of the application by the Board of Graduate Studies.You can follow the progress of your application online using the self-service facility on the CamSIS website.We will not normally admit anyone to graduate work unless they have a high upper second, or first class, honours degree from a university in the UK, or a degree of an equivalent standard from an overseas university. If you have not yet completed your degree, you may be made an offer conditional on obtaining a particular class in that degree. Masters level qualifications are required for entry to the Ph.D. programme.Applicants will normally hold a degree in Music, though suitably qualified applicants with a background in arts, humanities, and social and natural sciences are all welcome. Applicants from the European Union and from overseas are also encouraged.To be admitted to Cambridge, you must give evidence that you can meet the fees and maintenance costs as a graduate student for the entire period of your studies. Please check the Graduate Admissions website for details of the costs you will incur.Prospective PhD students should note that all expenses, including fees, can be expected to rise substantially over a three-year period of research. Students from overseas should also allow for fluctuations in currency exchange rates and take steps to fix the amount available to them in sterling.Please note that it is not possible to take paid work while you are studying full-time at Cambridge, and you must not expect to provide additional income in this way. The only exception to this is that PhD students can earn some money by giving supervisions to undergraduate students, but you should not rely upon this as a significant source of income as no more than six hours a week may be spent in teaching activities.The PhD is also available in part-time mode over five years. Applicants from outside the EU should however note that it is not possible to obtain a student visa for part-time study.Applicants who are not native English speakers must have a fluent command of the English language and must prove they have passed one of the required language proficiency examinations no more than two years before the start of the course. In the IELTS the minimum requirement is an overall band score of 7.5, with not less than 7.0 in the individual elements. In the TOEFL the minimum requirement is an overall score of 110 with not less than 25 in the individual elements. Test results can be uploaded either with your application or later to meet one of the terms of a conditional offer. Further information can be found on the International Students section of the Graduate Admissions website. Graduate admission to Cambridge is a two-stage process. First, you must be accepted by the Faculty, then by a college. All the colleges are open to both men and women, except for three – Murray Edwards (formerly New Hall), Newnham and Lucy Cavendish – which are for women only. Students do not have to be, and often are not, in the same college as their supervisor, nor need your college choice be determined by your field of study.There are five graduate colleges – Clare Hall, Darwin, Hughes Hall, St Edmund’s and Wolfson – which admit only graduate students and mature undergraduates. Because of the increasing number of graduate students, we strongly urge you to include at least one graduate college among your college options, since these colleges are more likely to accept you.If the colleges you have chosen are not able to offer you membership, the Student Registry will make your papers available to other selected colleges. It is University policy that no student who has met all the other conditions of their offer will be prevented from taking up their place purely through want of a college place, so long as the student has not refused an offer of college membership.For detailed information about each college, see the Graduate Studies Prospectus.If you have any other queries regarding graduate study in the Faculty of Music please email dcmusic@mus.cam.ac.uk.

See Funding Graduate Study for information on costs and funding options, with links to the University’s graduate funding pages.The Faculty will cover instrument tuition fees up to a cost of £40 per hour for four one-hour lessons for students opting to take the organ recital or continuo options. However, depending on your choice of organ teacher and the number of lessons needed, extra costs may be incurred. This can sometimes be subsidised from College bursaries but will otherwise have to be covered from private funds.Similarly, M.Mus. students choosing to take up the opportunities offered in Cambridge for extra training in keyboard or instrumental skills may be able to subsidise costs from College bursaries, but will otherwise have to find funds from private resources.Application deadlines are earlier for those students applying for funding.Applications must be made online; details of How to Apply are available here. Applicants for the M.Mus. are required asked also to supply a video recording of themselves performing in their chosen pathway discipline and a sample essay on any musical topic. The video should be approximately 10–15 minutes in length.Please note that video recordings cannot be uploaded through the University’s online application system but should be submitted direct to the Faculty through Dropbox by sharing electronic files with graduate.applications@mus.cam.ac.uk, please ensure that you include your full name in the file name. If you live in the UK, you will probably be invited to an interview; if you live elsewhere we can usually conduct the interview using SKYPE or by phone if necessary.Further details of graduate life at Cambridge may be found on the University’s Student Registry website.  © 2017 University of Cambridge

It is currently available in all areas in which we can offer supervision, including composition and practice-based research in performance.Doctoral research in the Faculty of Music is centred on individual scholarly activity in fields such as historical musicology, analysis, composition, ethnomusicology and music cognition, along with performance studies. The overwhelming majority of graduate students in the Faculty are undertaking research that is directly connected with the particular research interests of specific members of the Faculty, and for this reason the best starting point for an application is often to get in touch with the member of staff whose interests seem most in line with yours.Our list of Graduate Supervisors will give you an idea of some specific areas in which Faculty members are willing to supervise, and our Research area gives an overview of the principal areas of the Faculty’s research. You may also want to explore the publication lists of individual Faculty members, who are listed under Academic Staff.Because of the diversity of research topics pursued, the Ph.D. programme in music at Cambridge does not involve a core taught component: there is a variety of training in a range of skills, and some incoming research students audit courses offered within our M.Phil. programme, but in general you will be working mainly with your individual supervisor. Your formal studies will be complemented by attendance at Faculty colloquia and seminars, where you will meet other graduate students and members of the wider community centred round the Faculty, while membership of a college will enable you to socialise with students and others from a wide variety of disciplines. As you will quickly realise as you explore this website, studying for a Ph.D. at Cambridge gives you access to facilities and a range of Research Resources that compare favourably with anywhere in the world.Recorded performances may now be included within a doctoral submission, along with an academic thesis of the standard length. Students who wish to pursue this possibility are encouraged to make contact with the member of staff most relevant to their particular performance-related interests.We realise that for many potential applicants, funding is a major issue; see Funding Graduate Study for information on costs and funding options, with links to the University’s graduate funding pages. Applicants whose proposals involve fieldwork, performance tuition, or other substantial expenses should include an indication of approximate total costs as part of their application.  While small grants may be available for research and travel purposes, these should not be expected to cover funding for your case studies, performance tuition or fieldwork expenses. Some support for doctoral students undertaking fieldwork is available from the School of Arts and Humanities.Applications must be made online, and details of How to Apply are available here. If you are applying in an area other than Composition, please include with your application a summary (approximately 750 words plus bibliography) of your proposed research, and one or two samples of your recent work, e.g. essays of 2,000-4,000 words each or an undergraduate or Master's dissertation.Applicants who wish to include a performance component in their eventual submission are specifically asked to describe how their scholarly research and performance activity will interrelate and inform each other. In addition, they should submit the following as part of their application:Candidates for the Ph.D. specialising in Composition are asked to submit:If you live in the UK you may be invited to an interview; if you live elsewhere we can usually conduct an interview using Skype or by phone if necessary.We can accept applications to work towards a Ph.D. on a part-time basis over five years instead of full-time over three. This is not a distance degree: although you will not need to live in Cambridge, you will be expected to attend supervisions in person and participate in some Faculty activities. If you come from outside the EU, please note that it is not possible to obtain a student visa for part-time study.

You wouldn’t be reading this if you weren’t fascinated by and passionate about music, but there are many different ways to further your knowledge of it.One important decision is whether to go to a university or a conservatoire. While both involve practical studies, universities set them in a broader context of academic study, which means that you acquire a large number of transferable skills that prepare you for life after university.Many music students enter the music profession in one guise or another, as performers, composers, teachers or administrators, but a music degree prepares students for a career in almost anything, with a number each year going on to work in finance, management and law. In short, you can set yourself up for life while doing what you really want to do and doing what you really want to do is the best way to get a good degree!For information about the course, please see the Course outline. You can download the current version of the Faculty of Music Prospectus here (PDF).For general application information please see the University Prospectus. You will find details of the music course and entry requirements at www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/music/. Like the rest of the University, we are committed to supporting disabled applicants; the University’s Disability Resource Centre contains more information on the support available.

The Tripos runs for three years and at the end of it you graduate with the Bachelor of Arts qualification.The Music Tripos consists of three parts: Part IA, Part IB and Part II; one part is taken each academic year. The teaching of the Tripos is divided into three eight week terms, traditionally called Michaelmas (October–early December), Lent (January–March), and Easter (April–early June).In each year of the Tripos you take six papers (or modules). In Part IA all six papers are compulsory (though you can choose between recital, composition or extended essay in one paper); in Part IB you take three compulsory papers and select three more from a list of options; and in Part II you are free to choose all six papers. Part IA provides you with a thorough grounding in the basic musicological disciplines – history, analysis, harmony and counterpoint, and general musicianship skills – after which you are well equipped to tackle the broader choices in Parts IB and II.All papers are taught through lectures, seminars, and supervisions (small-group teaching in Colleges). The Faculty of Music organises lectures and seminars, and Colleges organise supervisions (with guidance from the Faculty of Music). Although the content of the supervisions may vary between Colleges, everyone receives the same lecture and seminar content.

Music and Musicology TodayThis is a three-part course that provides you with ways of thinking about music in today's world. The first part comprises a series of lectures about the main areas of musicology today; the second part teaches general 'music life skills' essential for successful learning in Cambridge; and the third takes the form of independent supervised study, leading to either a performance, a composition or an extended essay.2. Music History I: Music in Sacred Ritual 800–1600This is a conventional lecture course that familiarises you with a broad range of Western music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, and the ways in which historical contexts shaped this music.3. Music History I: Studies in Music from 1750 to 1914This course familiarises you with a broad range of Western music from c. 1750 to c. 1914, taking into account changes in compositional style, and institutional, historical and cultural contexts4. Introduction to Music AnalysisMusic analysis is the attempt to answer the question 'how does this music work?' and this course focuses on selected genres and forms of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, teaching you how to apply analytical and interpretative techniques and strategies to selected compositions.5. Counterpoint6. Harmony and General MusicianshipThese two courses develop musical literacy and historical awareness in the use of harmony and counterpoint through stylistic compositional studies, practical skills (at the keyboard or another appropriate instrument), and graded aural exercises.

The choice of subjects is not critical, and humanities subjects, languages and sciences are all good choices. We also accept qualifications from other examination systems; there is a University web page with further information about this. ABRSM Grade 8 Theory (Merit) can be offered as a substitute for A Level Music. A Level Music Technology is recognised as an additional A Level, but not considered a substitute for Music A Level.Finally, we expect you to have some familiarity with the Western classical repertoire, and to have experience of writing about music. A well developed musical ear, basic facility at the keyboard, and some proficiency in harmony and counterpoint are also desirable, though few successful applicants have equal facility in all these areas.To find out more, browse or download the Music Faculty Prospectus, or visit the music page of the University’s Undergraduate Prospectus. There is also admissions information from the various Colleges, through whom you make your application.

Which college should I apply for?10. Will my choice of college affect my chances of getting in?11. I’m over 21. Does that make a difference?12. What if I have a disability?13. Are there any additional costs associated with course? I haven’t taken A level music but I have ABRSM grade 8 theory; can I still apply to Cambridge?Yes. All colleges will consider an application with Grade 8 theory instead of A level music.I study music technology instead of music; can I still apply to Cambridge?Not normally. Because of the nature of our curriculum, we are happy to accept A level Music Technology as a supplement to A level Music, but not as a substitute for it. However, individual colleges assess each application on its merits, and those responsible for admissions are always willing to discuss special circumstances.Do I have to have Grade 5 piano? What if I haven’t studied harmony and counterpoint?Our teaching takes account of individual abilities, and for this reason we don’t impose absolute requirements. Some ability to play the piano is helpful, and if you have the option to take A level Harmony and Counterpoint elements we would recommend that you do so. All this will increase your preparedness for our programme but neither is an absolute requirement.Do you provide instrumental tuition?Colleges provide support for individual instrumental and vocal lessons, though the level of support can vary from college to college. You should contact the college you are interested in applying to about this. Extra support in the form of bursaries is also sometimes available and instrumental award holders are given extra tuition too.How many practice rooms are there?The Faculty doesn’t have designated practice rooms because these facilities are provided by colleges. However, Faculty teaching rooms (including the large recital room and the concert hall) can be booked for individual or group rehearsals when not in use for other purposes.I’m interested in a Choral or Organ Award, when do I need to apply for this?The deadline for Choral and Organ Award applications is earlier than the UCAS deadline. All the information about applications and deadlines is given on the Music Awards pages. Applicants also need to submit a UCAS application form by the 15th October deadline.I’m interested in an instrumental Award, do I apply for this with my UCAS form?No. Applications for the instrumental awards scheme are dealt with after applications for an academic place have been considered and offers have been made. If you receive an offer and would like to apply you will find application information on the Instrumental Awards pages.Which college should I apply for?Choosing a college is primarily a matter of personal preference. You may wish to consider aspects of the colleges such as the number of Music students they admit, their history or location, or the particular facilities they offer. Whichever college you choose, you will still receive the same standard of teaching and support.Will my choice of college affect my chances of getting in?Some colleges attract many more applications than others. But the colleges all look for the same basic characteristics in a successful applicant, and there is a pooling system. As a result, when a college can’t accept a strong application, it is passed to another college that can.Will I get to perform as part of the course?Yes, if you choose to. You can offer performance as part of your assessment in all three years of the course. However, even if you don’t opt for this, performing can take up a lot of your time here. There is a huge number of music societies and ensembles active in the university, with at least one concert taking place somewhere virtually every night, so you will never be without the opportunity to perform.I’m over 21. Does that make a difference?We welcome mature students, and four of the colleges specialise in admitting students like you. The University undergraduate admissions pages have specific information for Mature Students.What if I have a disability?Like any other student, you can thrive here. Every effort will be made to provide a suitable and supportive learning environment for you. The Disability Resource Centre (DRC) is an essential first point of contact. They can provide you with advice on the accessibility of colleges in relation to the Music Faculty, and information on the support available to you; they may even be able to put you in touch with a student who has a disability similar to yours, so that you can find out about their experiences here. We recommend that you disclose your disability in your UCAS application so that you can be contacted to arrange any special requirements for interviews.Are there any additional costs associated with course?There are no compulsory additional costs for the course beyond a single study score for Analysis in the first year, typically costing in the region of £10.  Students who take performance options are guaranteed financial support for lessons through the Colleges to minimum levels as follows: 1st year - £420; 2nd year - £540; 3rd year - £700.  Music books and scores are available in the libraries in Cambridge (in the Faculty, Colleges, and in the University Library).  Students typically buy a few copies of books and study scores to have to hand when needed.  Purchases depend on the preferences of the individual student and the holdings of individual College libraries but do not normally exceed £100 per annum.  Support for optional purchases is available through book grants provided by individual Colleges.

Peter Burkholder, Donald Jay Grout and Claude V. Palisca, A History of Western Music (New York, multiple editions) – will provide a framework, which you should complement by listening to as many of the examples discussed as you can.  It would also be good to explore at least one form of non-western or popular music: a useful beginning point would be Philip V. Bohlman, World Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2002).Harmony and CounterpointYou might begin to familiarize yourself with the styles and procedures of the following. Listen to these suggested examples with the score, and make notes on any features you find of interest; this will help you to become more familiar with the sound of the musical styles that you will study in your first year.(i) Later sixteenth-century mass settings, eg. Palestrina’s Missa Aeterna Christi munera; Look out in particular for points of imitation in the Kyrie.(ii) Baroque fugues, especially by J.S. Bach, eg. the first book of  The Well-Tempered Clavier; Trace the handling of the fugue subject in the first fugue in C major.(iii) Classical minuets, eg. as found in Haydn’s op. 17 quartets;Try analysing the phrase structure, modulations, and form in the Minuet from the first of the string quartets in this collection.       (iv) The Romantic Lied, eg. Schubert’s song cycle Die schöne Müllerin (a translation of the text is available here); Think about the relationship between the words and the music, especially in No. 3, ‘Halt!’; no. 12, ‘Pause’, and no. 20, ‘Des Baches Wiegenlied’. Aural and Practical SkillsIt would be worthwhile exploring musical repertories other than those related to your principal instrument(s). Where possible, follow a recording or performance with a score: this will help you to begin to make connections between sounds and their notation. In time, you will acquire the ability to ‘hear’ a score—including one that you are writing—in your head. Meanwhile, you might practise score-reading at the piano, beginning with simpler passages from string quartets and other chamber works: as a starting point, try playing through the Palestrina and Haydn scores (especially the minuets) suggested above.Once in Cambridge, you will be able to use the excellent library resources available, but it is well worth building up your own personal library of books and study scores, so that you have them to hand as and when you need them. Music and music books can be expensive, but bear in mind that they can be put to multiple uses: a volume of Mozart or Beethoven string quartets, for example, will be relevant to work in harmony and counterpoint, analysis, and history, as well as providing excellent material for score-reading practice. Dover editions are relatively inexpensive, and offer a very wide range of repertoire. If you don’t have a good book or music shop near where you live, abebooks.co.uk is an excellent source for second-hand (and out-of-print) material. And don’t neglect your local Oxfam or other charity shop—there are often bargains to be had.We hope that you find these notes helpful. Your College Director of Studies will be happy to explain matters in more detail, and to provide further advice on reading, listening and other preparatory study.

The first year provides a broadly-based introduction to the subject, while the second and third years offer increasing opportunities for specialism, including substantial self-directed projects such as dissertations and composition portfolios.As a music student at Cambridge, you will have access to a fully professional concert hall, a music library, and the Centre for Music and Science with its purpose-built studio and music computing facilities. Period instruments and a Javanese gamelan are available for student use. All this is complemented by the libraries, practice rooms and other facilities available in colleges, as well as by the University library—one of the world’s great libraries, housing over seven million volumes.The college system means that you receive two complementary kinds of teaching: lectures and seminars by world-leading experts in the Faculty of Music, and small-group supervision within your college.Cambridge is home to a diverse and rich music scene which caters for music making at all levels.

Students selected for the scheme are assigned a teacher at the Academy and in addition to receiving individual tuition on their principal instrument, they may attend (and exceptionally perform in) departmental classes by arrangement. Lessons are paid for by the College of successful students, as the supervision equivalent, and do not represent additional funding.CAMRAM was established in 2013 by the Director of Performance, Margaret Faultless, who is also Head of Historical Performance at the Academy. Students on the scheme benefit from individual advice provided by Margaret in devising a tailor-made programme of study.Sam Barrett, Chairman of the Music Faculty Board, comments:‘The University of Cambridge has a long history of nurturing performers who have gone on to illustrious careers, and many of our best musicians proceed to conservatoires for further study.  The CAMRAM scheme affords performers of exceptional promise an unrivalled opportunity: they can enjoy international-level specialist tuition in performance and attend classes at a leading conservatoire while taking a course at one of the world's most renowned research universities.  The scheme has already provided a stepping stone to a professional career for exceptional performers and places are highly prized.'A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

The M.Mus. benefits from the input of Dr Edward Wickham, Dr Geoffrey Webber and other Directors of Music in the Colleges, along with the Director of Performance, Margaret Faultless.The course consists of six elements:Find out more about the M.Mus. in Choral Studies.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

Most Performance Studies candidates take two such courses, which cover key subdisciplinary areas and methodologies. The seminar course on Techniques of Performance Studies is required of candidates on this pathway. In addition, students on the Performance Studies pathway who choose the recital option are required to take 20 hours of instrumental or vocal lessons with a teacher approved by the Faculty.An individual project is completed by all MPhil students, and in the case of Performance Studies there are two options:An extended submission option may be available to MPhil students depending on their results in the first part of the programme.

It is currently available in all areas in which we can offer supervision, including composition and practice-based research in performance.Doctoral research in the Faculty of Music is centred on individual scholarly activity in fields such as performance studies, along with historical musicology, analysis, composition, ethnomusicology and music cognition. Recorded performances incorporating or reflecting the results of practice-led research may now be included within a doctoral submission, along with an academic thesis of the standard length. Students who wish to pursue this possibility are encouraged to make contact with the member of staff most relevant to their particular performance-related interests.By way of example, doctoral research in the Faculty has recently been undertaken on the following performance-related topics, among others:Find out more about the Ph.D. in Music.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

Participants and listeners find the experience inspirational and stimulating, both musically and intellectually.Performance students are able to attend public and internal masterclasses in addition to regular performance workshops run by the Director of Performance, Margaret Faultless and guests.In the Practising Performance series, the Faculty of Music has hosted classes with Michael Chance, Nicholas Cleobury, Ross Duffin, Richard Egarr, Sir Mark Elder, Ketil Haugsand, Steven Isserlis, Andrew Kennedy, Joanna MacGregor, Nicholas Mulroy, Sir Roger Norrington, Verity Sharp, Jeremy West and many other significant performers.Collaborations with CMPCP and CRASSH have resulted in masterclasses with Richard Goode, Roy Howat, Yundi Li, Robert Levin and Angela Hewitt.2017/18 Practising Performance events Side-by-side eventsThese periodic events give select student musicians at Cambridge the chance to gain valuable musical insight by playing ‘side-by-side’ with leading professionals. These events take place each year in collaboration with the Academy of Ancient Music, enhancing students’ understanding of the life of a professional period instrument orchestra and musician. The fact that the AAM’s intimate knowledge of the repertoire and the period-instrument sound world has been passed on to students working alongside AAM players has been a major benefit. Students who have taken part have indicated the value of ‘learning through osmosis’, and when asked to identify the best features of the day, more than one student has responded, ‘Everything’. One student viola player recently commented: ‘Sitting side-by-side with the AAM in an AAMplify workshop was absolutely the best experience of my musical life.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

Tuition in the principal instrument (including voice) is normally arranged through students’ individual colleges; in addition, Margaret Faultless, the Music Faculty’s Director of Performance, arranges masterclasses and workshops, some of which are hosted by the Cambridge Centre for Musical Performance Studies. Students are also encouraged to take part in ensembles and other performance activities within the University, Faculty, colleges and/or the wider community.In the first year, all Music students have the option of giving a recital (but, as with assessed performance at other levels, this is not obligatory). In the second year, we run a course on Performance Studies. This allows students to focus on historical performance, analysis and performance, and the psychology of performance. The course aims to give students a broader awareness of the multi-faceted components of the performer’s art and the wide range of issues underpinning it. Students electing this course can choose to perform a recital or write an assessed essay. In the third year, Music students can opt to give a full recital. Financial support for vocal / instrumental lessons increases from roughly six hours of tuition in the first year to ten hours in the final year; this is equivalent to £700 for finalists. Further support may be available from individual colleges.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

See Funding Graduate Study for information on costs and links to the University’s graduate funding pages. Please note that, if you specialise in Performance studies and choose the recital option, you will need to take vocal or instrumental lessons with an approved teacher, for which we recommend that you budget a further £1,200. Students specialising in Ethnomusicology may opt to carry out fieldwork, in which case you are strongly advised to make an additional financial provision of up to £1,000.  Small grants may be available to support these costs, but they cannot be relied upon to meet the total cost of lessons or fieldwork expenses.Application deadlines are earlier for those students applying for funding.Applications must be made online and details of How to Apply can be found here. Please include a sample of your recent written work (c. 3,000, and no more than 5,000 words in total). Please also submit a summary in approximately 250 words of your proposed dissertation or extended essay topic.Applicants who wish to specialise in Performance studies with the recital option should additionally include one or more audio recordings featuring a range of repertoire lasting approximately 60 minutes in total. Audio recordings cannot be uploaded through the online application system, but should be submitted directly to the Faculty through Dropbox, by sharing files with graduate.applications@mus.cam.ac.uk.Applicants wishing to specialise in Composition are asked to submit:If you live near Cambridge you may be invited to an interview; if you live elsewhere in the UK or abroad we can usually conduct an interview using Skype or by phone if necessary.Further details of graduate life at Cambridge may be found on the University’s Student Registry website.

At the national level, the AHRC offers studentships that are open to both UK and other EU applicants, and cover tuition and maintenance costs (tuition only for non-UK applicants); applications are made through the University and we can help you with this. Click here for further information on the AHRC.There are also various schemes specifically to support study at Cambridge. For UK and EU doctoral students there is the Cambridge Home/EU Studentships Scheme (CHESS). For students from outside the UK, the Gates Cambridge Trust offers full-cost support for all graduate degrees, while the Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trusts offer partial support for Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth students respectively, again at all levels. Finally the Cambridge International Scholarships Scheme (CISS) offers full-cost support for doctoral students from outside the UK.Details of these and a number of other funding opportunities are available on the Graduate Admissions web pages. The Student Registry website includes an introduction to costs and funding and an overview of funding opportunities, with links to separate funding guides for UK, EU, and overseas students. Note that some of these schemes have quite early deadlines (for example October for the Gates Cambridge Trust), so you should begin researching funding opportunities at least a year before you intend to begin your course.

The final deadline for applicants seeking funding is 4 January 2018, but earlier deadlines will apply (for example if you are an overseas applicant from outside the EU). Even if you are not seeking funding, we strongly recommend that you submit your application by 4 January, as no applications will be accepted once programmes are full.  If places are still available on programmes beyond this deadline, self-funded applicants will continue to be considered until the final deadline of 31 May 2018.After submitting your online application form, there may be a delay of up to 48 hours before you are able to access your self-service account and submit supporting documentation.The instructions include a list of the supporting documents you will need to include with your application, such as transcripts and references. In addition to these, be sure to include the materials specified on the page for the programme for which you are applying (M.Phil., M.Mus., or Ph.D.). You do not need to include a CV with your application unless you are applying to specialise in composition on the M.Phil course.The three main criteria for acceptance are:If a prospective supervisor is available, she or he is asked to produce an assessment of the application for the Graduate Committee. If this is negative the application will usually be declined; if positive, the applicant (if resident in this country) is invited for interview by the prospective supervisor and another senior Faculty member, who will report back to the Graduate Committee recommending acceptance or rejection. You will be informed of the outcome of the application by the Board of Graduate Studies.You can follow the progress of your application online using the self-service facility on the CamSIS website.We will not normally admit anyone to graduate work unless they have a high upper second, or first class, honours degree from a university in the UK, or a degree of an equivalent standard from an overseas university. If you have not yet completed your degree, you may be made an offer conditional on obtaining a particular class in that degree. Masters level qualifications are required for entry to the Ph.D. programme.Applicants will normally hold a degree in Music, though suitably qualified applicants with a background in arts, humanities, and social and natural sciences are all welcome. Applicants from the European Union and from overseas are also encouraged.To be admitted to Cambridge, you must give evidence that you can meet the fees and maintenance costs as a graduate student for the entire period of your studies. Please check the Graduate Admissions website for details of the costs you will incur.Prospective PhD students should note that all expenses, including fees, can be expected to rise substantially over a three-year period of research. Students from overseas should also allow for fluctuations in currency exchange rates and take steps to fix the amount available to them in sterling.Please note that it is not possible to take paid work while you are studying full-time at Cambridge, and you must not expect to provide additional income in this way. The only exception to this is that PhD students can earn some money by giving supervisions to undergraduate students, but you should not rely upon this as a significant source of income as no more than six hours a week may be spent in teaching activities.The PhD is also available in part-time mode over five years. Applicants from outside the EU should however note that it is not possible to obtain a student visa for part-time study.Applicants who are not native English speakers must have a fluent command of the English language and must prove they have passed one of the required language proficiency examinations no more than two years before the start of the course. In the IELTS the minimum requirement is an overall band score of 7.5, with not less than 7.0 in the individual elements. In the TOEFL the minimum requirement is an overall score of 110 with not less than 25 in the individual elements. Test results can be uploaded either with your application or later to meet one of the terms of a conditional offer. Further information can be found on the International Students section of the Graduate Admissions website. Graduate admission to Cambridge is a two-stage process. First, you must be accepted by the Faculty, then by a college. All the colleges are open to both men and women, except for three – Murray Edwards (formerly New Hall), Newnham and Lucy Cavendish – which are for women only. Students do not have to be, and often are not, in the same college as their supervisor, nor need your college choice be determined by your field of study.There are five graduate colleges – Clare Hall, Darwin, Hughes Hall, St Edmund’s and Wolfson – which admit only graduate students and mature undergraduates. Because of the increasing number of graduate students, we strongly urge you to include at least one graduate college among your college options, since these colleges are more likely to accept you.If the colleges you have chosen are not able to offer you membership, the Student Registry will make your papers available to other selected colleges. It is University policy that no student who has met all the other conditions of their offer will be prevented from taking up their place purely through want of a college place, so long as the student has not refused an offer of college membership.For detailed information about each college, see the Graduate Studies Prospectus.If you have any other queries regarding graduate study in the Faculty of Music please email dcmusic@mus.cam.ac.uk.

See Funding Graduate Study for information on costs and funding options, with links to the University’s graduate funding pages.The Faculty will cover instrument tuition fees up to a cost of £40 per hour for four one-hour lessons for students opting to take the organ recital or continuo options. However, depending on your choice of organ teacher and the number of lessons needed, extra costs may be incurred. This can sometimes be subsidised from College bursaries but will otherwise have to be covered from private funds.Similarly, M.Mus. students choosing to take up the opportunities offered in Cambridge for extra training in keyboard or instrumental skills may be able to subsidise costs from College bursaries, but will otherwise have to find funds from private resources.Application deadlines are earlier for those students applying for funding.Applications must be made online; details of How to Apply are available here. Applicants for the M.Mus. are required asked also to supply a video recording of themselves performing in their chosen pathway discipline and a sample essay on any musical topic. The video should be approximately 10–15 minutes in length.Please note that video recordings cannot be uploaded through the University’s online application system but should be submitted direct to the Faculty through Dropbox by sharing electronic files with graduate.applications@mus.cam.ac.uk, please ensure that you include your full name in the file name. If you live in the UK, you will probably be invited to an interview; if you live elsewhere we can usually conduct the interview using SKYPE or by phone if necessary.Further details of graduate life at Cambridge may be found on the University’s Student Registry website.  © 2017 University of Cambridge

It is currently available in all areas in which we can offer supervision, including composition and practice-based research in performance.Doctoral research in the Faculty of Music is centred on individual scholarly activity in fields such as historical musicology, analysis, composition, ethnomusicology and music cognition, along with performance studies. The overwhelming majority of graduate students in the Faculty are undertaking research that is directly connected with the particular research interests of specific members of the Faculty, and for this reason the best starting point for an application is often to get in touch with the member of staff whose interests seem most in line with yours.Our list of Graduate Supervisors will give you an idea of some specific areas in which Faculty members are willing to supervise, and our Research area gives an overview of the principal areas of the Faculty’s research. You may also want to explore the publication lists of individual Faculty members, who are listed under Academic Staff.Because of the diversity of research topics pursued, the Ph.D. programme in music at Cambridge does not involve a core taught component: there is a variety of training in a range of skills, and some incoming research students audit courses offered within our M.Phil. programme, but in general you will be working mainly with your individual supervisor. Your formal studies will be complemented by attendance at Faculty colloquia and seminars, where you will meet other graduate students and members of the wider community centred round the Faculty, while membership of a college will enable you to socialise with students and others from a wide variety of disciplines. As you will quickly realise as you explore this website, studying for a Ph.D. at Cambridge gives you access to facilities and a range of Research Resources that compare favourably with anywhere in the world.Recorded performances may now be included within a doctoral submission, along with an academic thesis of the standard length. Students who wish to pursue this possibility are encouraged to make contact with the member of staff most relevant to their particular performance-related interests.We realise that for many potential applicants, funding is a major issue; see Funding Graduate Study for information on costs and funding options, with links to the University’s graduate funding pages. Applicants whose proposals involve fieldwork, performance tuition, or other substantial expenses should include an indication of approximate total costs as part of their application.  While small grants may be available for research and travel purposes, these should not be expected to cover funding for your case studies, performance tuition or fieldwork expenses. Some support for doctoral students undertaking fieldwork is available from the School of Arts and Humanities.Applications must be made online, and details of How to Apply are available here. If you are applying in an area other than Composition, please include with your application a summary (approximately 750 words plus bibliography) of your proposed research, and one or two samples of your recent work, e.g. essays of 2,000-4,000 words each or an undergraduate or Master's dissertation.Applicants who wish to include a performance component in their eventual submission are specifically asked to describe how their scholarly research and performance activity will interrelate and inform each other. In addition, they should submit the following as part of their application:Candidates for the Ph.D. specialising in Composition are asked to submit:If you live in the UK you may be invited to an interview; if you live elsewhere we can usually conduct an interview using Skype or by phone if necessary.We can accept applications to work towards a Ph.D. on a part-time basis over five years instead of full-time over three. This is not a distance degree: although you will not need to live in Cambridge, you will be expected to attend supervisions in person and participate in some Faculty activities. If you come from outside the EU, please note that it is not possible to obtain a student visa for part-time study.

You wouldn’t be reading this if you weren’t fascinated by and passionate about music, but there are many different ways to further your knowledge of it.One important decision is whether to go to a university or a conservatoire. While both involve practical studies, universities set them in a broader context of academic study, which means that you acquire a large number of transferable skills that prepare you for life after university.Many music students enter the music profession in one guise or another, as performers, composers, teachers or administrators, but a music degree prepares students for a career in almost anything, with a number each year going on to work in finance, management and law. In short, you can set yourself up for life while doing what you really want to do and doing what you really want to do is the best way to get a good degree!For information about the course, please see the Course outline. You can download the current version of the Faculty of Music Prospectus here (PDF).For general application information please see the University Prospectus. You will find details of the music course and entry requirements at www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/music/. Like the rest of the University, we are committed to supporting disabled applicants; the University’s Disability Resource Centre contains more information on the support available.

The Tripos runs for three years and at the end of it you graduate with the Bachelor of Arts qualification.The Music Tripos consists of three parts: Part IA, Part IB and Part II; one part is taken each academic year. The teaching of the Tripos is divided into three eight week terms, traditionally called Michaelmas (October–early December), Lent (January–March), and Easter (April–early June).In each year of the Tripos you take six papers (or modules). In Part IA all six papers are compulsory (though you can choose between recital, composition or extended essay in one paper); in Part IB you take three compulsory papers and select three more from a list of options; and in Part II you are free to choose all six papers. Part IA provides you with a thorough grounding in the basic musicological disciplines – history, analysis, harmony and counterpoint, and general musicianship skills – after which you are well equipped to tackle the broader choices in Parts IB and II.All papers are taught through lectures, seminars, and supervisions (small-group teaching in Colleges). The Faculty of Music organises lectures and seminars, and Colleges organise supervisions (with guidance from the Faculty of Music). Although the content of the supervisions may vary between Colleges, everyone receives the same lecture and seminar content.

The first part comprises a series of lectures about the main areas of musicology today; the second part teaches general 'music life skills' essential for successful learning in Cambridge; and the third takes the form of independent supervised study, leading to either a performance, a composition or an extended essay.2. Music History I: Music in Sacred Ritual 800–1600This is a conventional lecture course that familiarises you with a broad range of Western music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, and the ways in which historical contexts shaped this music.3. Music History I: Studies in Music from 1750 to 1914This course familiarises you with a broad range of Western music from c. 1750 to c. 1914, taking into account changes in compositional style, and institutional, historical and cultural contexts4. Introduction to Music AnalysisMusic analysis is the attempt to answer the question 'how does this music work?' and this course focuses on selected genres and forms of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, teaching you how to apply analytical and interpretative techniques and strategies to selected compositions.5. Counterpoint6. Harmony and General MusicianshipThese two courses develop musical literacy and historical awareness in the use of harmony and counterpoint through stylistic compositional studies, practical skills (at the keyboard or another appropriate instrument), and graded aural exercises.

The choice of subjects is not critical, and humanities subjects, languages and sciences are all good choices. We also accept qualifications from other examination systems; there is a University web page with further information about this. ABRSM Grade 8 Theory (Merit) can be offered as a substitute for A Level Music. A Level Music Technology is recognised as an additional A Level, but not considered a substitute for Music A Level.Finally, we expect you to have some familiarity with the Western classical repertoire, and to have experience of writing about music. A well developed musical ear, basic facility at the keyboard, and some proficiency in harmony and counterpoint are also desirable, though few successful applicants have equal facility in all these areas.To find out more, browse or download the Music Faculty Prospectus, or visit the music page of the University’s Undergraduate Prospectus. There is also admissions information from the various Colleges, through whom you make your application.

I haven’t taken A level music but I have ABRSM grade 8 theory; can I still apply to Cambridge?2. I study music technology instead of music; can I still apply to Cambridge?3. Do I have to have Grade 5 piano? What if I haven’t studied harmony and counterpoint?4. Do you provide instrumental tuition?5. How many practice rooms are there?6. I’m interested in a Choral or Organ Award, when do I need to apply?7. I’m interested in an instrumental Award, do I apply for this with my UCAS form?8. Will I get to perform as part of the course?9. Which college should I apply for?10. Will my choice of college affect my chances of getting in?11. I’m over 21. Does that make a difference?12. What if I have a disability?13. Are there any additional costs associated with course? I haven’t taken A level music but I have ABRSM grade 8 theory; can I still apply to Cambridge?Yes. All colleges will consider an application with Grade 8 theory instead of A level music.I study music technology instead of music; can I still apply to Cambridge?Not normally. Because of the nature of our curriculum, we are happy to accept A level Music Technology as a supplement to A level Music, but not as a substitute for it. However, individual colleges assess each application on its merits, and those responsible for admissions are always willing to discuss special circumstances.Do I have to have Grade 5 piano? What if I haven’t studied harmony and counterpoint?Our teaching takes account of individual abilities, and for this reason we don’t impose absolute requirements. Some ability to play the piano is helpful, and if you have the option to take A level Harmony and Counterpoint elements we would recommend that you do so. All this will increase your preparedness for our programme but neither is an absolute requirement.Do you provide instrumental tuition?Colleges provide support for individual instrumental and vocal lessons, though the level of support can vary from college to college. You should contact the college you are interested in applying to about this. Extra support in the form of bursaries is also sometimes available and instrumental award holders are given extra tuition too.How many practice rooms are there?The Faculty doesn’t have designated practice rooms because these facilities are provided by colleges. However, Faculty teaching rooms (including the large recital room and the concert hall) can be booked for individual or group rehearsals when not in use for other purposes.I’m interested in a Choral or Organ Award, when do I need to apply for this?The deadline for Choral and Organ Award applications is earlier than the UCAS deadline. All the information about applications and deadlines is given on the Music Awards pages. Applicants also need to submit a UCAS application form by the 15th October deadline.I’m interested in an instrumental Award, do I apply for this with my UCAS form?No. Applications for the instrumental awards scheme are dealt with after applications for an academic place have been considered and offers have been made. If you receive an offer and would like to apply you will find application information on the Instrumental Awards pages.Which college should I apply for?Choosing a college is primarily a matter of personal preference. You may wish to consider aspects of the colleges such as the number of Music students they admit, their history or location, or the particular facilities they offer. Whichever college you choose, you will still receive the same standard of teaching and support.Will my choice of college affect my chances of getting in?Some colleges attract many more applications than others. But the colleges all look for the same basic characteristics in a successful applicant, and there is a pooling system. As a result, when a college can’t accept a strong application, it is passed to another college that can.Will I get to perform as part of the course?Yes, if you choose to. You can offer performance as part of your assessment in all three years of the course. However, even if you don’t opt for this, performing can take up a lot of your time here. There is a huge number of music societies and ensembles active in the university, with at least one concert taking place somewhere virtually every night, so you will never be without the opportunity to perform.I’m over 21. Does that make a difference?We welcome mature students, and four of the colleges specialise in admitting students like you. The University undergraduate admissions pages have specific information for Mature Students.What if I have a disability?Like any other student, you can thrive here. Every effort will be made to provide a suitable and supportive learning environment for you. The Disability Resource Centre (DRC) is an essential first point of contact. They can provide you with advice on the accessibility of colleges in relation to the Music Faculty, and information on the support available to you; they may even be able to put you in touch with a student who has a disability similar to yours, so that you can find out about their experiences here. We recommend that you disclose your disability in your UCAS application so that you can be contacted to arrange any special requirements for interviews.Are there any additional costs associated with course?There are no compulsory additional costs for the course beyond a single study score for Analysis in the first year, typically costing in the region of £10.  Students who take performance options are guaranteed financial support for lessons through the Colleges to minimum levels as follows: 1st year - £420; 2nd year - £540; 3rd year - £700.  Music books and scores are available in the libraries in Cambridge (in the Faculty, Colleges, and in the University Library).  Students typically buy a few copies of books and study scores to have to hand when needed.  Purchases depend on the preferences of the individual student and the holdings of individual College libraries but do not normally exceed £100 per annum.  Support for optional purchases is available through book grants provided by individual Colleges.

Peter Burkholder, Donald Jay Grout and Claude V. Palisca, A History of Western Music (New York, multiple editions) – will provide a framework, which you should complement by listening to as many of the examples discussed as you can.  It would also be good to explore at least one form of non-western or popular music: a useful beginning point would be Philip V. Bohlman, World Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2002).Harmony and CounterpointYou might begin to familiarize yourself with the styles and procedures of the following. Listen to these suggested examples with the score, and make notes on any features you find of interest; this will help you to become more familiar with the sound of the musical styles that you will study in your first year.(i) Later sixteenth-century mass settings, eg. Palestrina’s Missa Aeterna Christi munera; Look out in particular for points of imitation in the Kyrie.(ii) Baroque fugues, especially by J.S. Bach, eg. the first book of  The Well-Tempered Clavier; Trace the handling of the fugue subject in the first fugue in C major.(iii) Classical minuets, eg. as found in Haydn’s op. 17 quartets;Try analysing the phrase structure, modulations, and form in the Minuet from the first of the string quartets in this collection.       (iv) The Romantic Lied, eg. Schubert’s song cycle Die schöne Müllerin (a translation of the text is available here); Think about the relationship between the words and the music, especially in No. 3, ‘Halt!’; no. 12, ‘Pause’, and no. 20, ‘Des Baches Wiegenlied’. Aural and Practical SkillsIt would be worthwhile exploring musical repertories other than those related to your principal instrument(s). Where possible, follow a recording or performance with a score: this will help you to begin to make connections between sounds and their notation. In time, you will acquire the ability to ‘hear’ a score—including one that you are writing—in your head. Meanwhile, you might practise score-reading at the piano, beginning with simpler passages from string quartets and other chamber works: as a starting point, try playing through the Palestrina and Haydn scores (especially the minuets) suggested above.Once in Cambridge, you will be able to use the excellent library resources available, but it is well worth building up your own personal library of books and study scores, so that you have them to hand as and when you need them. Music and music books can be expensive, but bear in mind that they can be put to multiple uses: a volume of Mozart or Beethoven string quartets, for example, will be relevant to work in harmony and counterpoint, analysis, and history, as well as providing excellent material for score-reading practice. Dover editions are relatively inexpensive, and offer a very wide range of repertoire. If you don’t have a good book or music shop near where you live, abebooks.co.uk is an excellent source for second-hand (and out-of-print) material. And don’t neglect your local Oxfam or other charity shop—there are often bargains to be had.We hope that you find these notes helpful. Your College Director of Studies will be happy to explain matters in more detail, and to provide further advice on reading, listening and other preparatory study.

This will normally include:When you come to Cambridge for interview, you will be invited to demonstrate your skills in a number of different areas.  We do not expect you to excel in all areas; rather, we use the interviews to explore your musical experience and interests, and to form an impression of your skills and capabilities as well as your potential to develop further as a student within the context of the music course at Cambridge. As part of the interview process, you will be asked to comment either verbally or in written form on a reading and/or a score; these will be set by the individual college where your interview is taking place.  In addition, you will be asked to talk about the areas of music that you have studied to date.  At some colleges, additional technical exercises are set (for example, a harmony and counterpoint exercise), and you may be asked to undertake keyboard and aural tests, and/or perform a short piece. Candidates should contact the admissions offices at individual colleges for further details.

The first year provides a broadly-based introduction to the subject, while the second and third years offer increasing opportunities for specialism, including substantial self-directed projects such as dissertations and composition portfolios.As a music student at Cambridge, you will have access to a fully professional concert hall, a music library, and the Centre for Music and Science with its purpose-built studio and music computing facilities. Period instruments and a Javanese gamelan are available for student use. All this is complemented by the libraries, practice rooms and other facilities available in colleges, as well as by the University library—one of the world’s great libraries, housing over seven million volumes.The college system means that you receive two complementary kinds of teaching: lectures and seminars by world-leading experts in the Faculty of Music, and small-group supervision within your college.Cambridge is home to a diverse and rich music scene which caters for music making at all levels.

Students selected for the scheme are assigned a teacher at the Academy and in addition to receiving individual tuition on their principal instrument, they may attend (and exceptionally perform in) departmental classes by arrangement. Lessons are paid for by the College of successful students, as the supervision equivalent, and do not represent additional funding.CAMRAM was established in 2013 by the Director of Performance, Margaret Faultless, who is also Head of Historical Performance at the Academy. Students on the scheme benefit from individual advice provided by Margaret in devising a tailor-made programme of study.Sam Barrett, Chairman of the Music Faculty Board, comments:‘The University of Cambridge has a long history of nurturing performers who have gone on to illustrious careers, and many of our best musicians proceed to conservatoires for further study.  The CAMRAM scheme affords performers of exceptional promise an unrivalled opportunity: they can enjoy international-level specialist tuition in performance and attend classes at a leading conservatoire while taking a course at one of the world's most renowned research universities.  The scheme has already provided a stepping stone to a professional career for exceptional performers and places are highly prized.'A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

Most Performance Studies candidates take two such courses, which cover key subdisciplinary areas and methodologies. The seminar course on Techniques of Performance Studies is required of candidates on this pathway. In addition, students on the Performance Studies pathway who choose the recital option are required to take 20 hours of instrumental or vocal lessons with a teacher approved by the Faculty.An individual project is completed by all MPhil students, and in the case of Performance Studies there are two options:An extended submission option may be available to MPhil students depending on their results in the first part of the programme. On the Performance Studies pathway, the extended individual project in such cases conforms to one of the following:Find out more about the M.Phil. in Music Studies.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

It is currently available in all areas in which we can offer supervision, including composition and practice-based research in performance.Doctoral research in the Faculty of Music is centred on individual scholarly activity in fields such as performance studies, along with historical musicology, analysis, composition, ethnomusicology and music cognition. Recorded performances incorporating or reflecting the results of practice-led research may now be included within a doctoral submission, along with an academic thesis of the standard length. Students who wish to pursue this possibility are encouraged to make contact with the member of staff most relevant to their particular performance-related interests.By way of example, doctoral research in the Faculty has recently been undertaken on the following performance-related topics, among others:Find out more about the Ph.D. in Music.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

Participants and listeners find the experience inspirational and stimulating, both musically and intellectually.Performance students are able to attend public and internal masterclasses in addition to regular performance workshops run by the Director of Performance, Margaret Faultless and guests.In the Practising Performance series, the Faculty of Music has hosted classes with Michael Chance, Nicholas Cleobury, Ross Duffin, Richard Egarr, Sir Mark Elder, Ketil Haugsand, Steven Isserlis, Andrew Kennedy, Joanna MacGregor, Nicholas Mulroy, Sir Roger Norrington, Verity Sharp, Jeremy West and many other significant performers.Collaborations with CMPCP and CRASSH have resulted in masterclasses with Richard Goode, Roy Howat, Yundi Li, Robert Levin and Angela Hewitt.2017/18 Practising Performance events Side-by-side eventsThese periodic events give select student musicians at Cambridge the chance to gain valuable musical insight by playing ‘side-by-side’ with leading professionals. These events take place each year in collaboration with the Academy of Ancient Music, enhancing students’ understanding of the life of a professional period instrument orchestra and musician. The fact that the AAM’s intimate knowledge of the repertoire and the period-instrument sound world has been passed on to students working alongside AAM players has been a major benefit. Students who have taken part have indicated the value of ‘learning through osmosis’, and when asked to identify the best features of the day, more than one student has responded, ‘Everything’. One student viola player recently commented: ‘Sitting side-by-side with the AAM in an AAMplify workshop was absolutely the best experience of my musical life.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge

Tuition in the principal instrument (including voice) is normally arranged through students’ individual colleges; in addition, Margaret Faultless, the Music Faculty’s Director of Performance, arranges masterclasses and workshops, some of which are hosted by the Cambridge Centre for Musical Performance Studies. Students are also encouraged to take part in ensembles and other performance activities within the University, Faculty, colleges and/or the wider community.In the first year, all Music students have the option of giving a recital (but, as with assessed performance at other levels, this is not obligatory). In the second year, we run a course on Performance Studies. This allows students to focus on historical performance, analysis and performance, and the psychology of performance. The course aims to give students a broader awareness of the multi-faceted components of the performer’s art and the wide range of issues underpinning it. Students electing this course can choose to perform a recital or write an assessed essay. In the third year, Music students can opt to give a full recital. Financial support for vocal / instrumental lessons increases from roughly six hours of tuition in the first year to ten hours in the final year; this is equivalent to £700 for finalists. Further support may be available from individual colleges.A Fellowship for Marin Alsop and a day to remember for Cambridge conductorsJohn Rink to appear on Radio 4’s “Something Understood”Kepler's Trial at the V&ACalling all music studentsMine Doğantan-Dack appointed as Performance Teaching AssociateExciting new collaboration with VOCES8 on MMus in Choral StudiesView all newsTweets by CamUniMusic© 2017 University of Cambridge
