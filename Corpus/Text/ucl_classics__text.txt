γηράσκω δ᾽ αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενοςExplore the rich heritage of Greece and Rome at one of the finest departments for the study of the ancient world, rated highly for its teaching and consistently outstanding in its research.Life Learning is a chance for you to follow one or two of our courses without enrolling as a student. The Department of Greek and Latin at UCL has an unrivalled range of courses, some taught in the original languages, some taught in translation. Most of these courses are available outside our degree programmes for those wishing to study for personal development or intellectual pleasure. The Department regularly admits Life Learning students, provided that they have the appropriate pre-requisite for the course(s) in which they are interested. (We also have to make sure that there is space on particular courses for existing students within the Department, but this does not usually present problems.) LL students come from a wide variety of backgrounds: retired people, mature students wishing to prepare for full-time education in the future, general enthusiasts, former students from the Department who wish to keep their experience of the Classical World alive, and teachers wishing to broaden their repertoire have all applied to us in the past. Courses run by the Department are scheduled at fixed times, which cannot be changed. Classes are timetabled between 9am and 6pm (see the Departmental course-list for further details). LL students participate in and contribute to courses in the same way as UCL students. However, LL is not formally accredited and students are not entitled to take the formal exam at the end of the year, although we have in the past allowed LL students to sit an exam informally within the department if they wish to. Once they have been admitted to the Department, LL students are entitled to have access to the UCL library with reference rights only.  If they wish to have borrowing rights, they need to request this from the Department who will arrange it with the UCL Library.  There is an extra fee of £150 for Library borrowing rights.  All cheques should be made payable to "University College London". If you would like to undertake a course as a LL student (full course list below), please complete an enrolment form and return by post or by email.  The deadline for receipt of completed forms for enrolment on courses for 2017/18 for term one is Monday 18 September 2017, and Monday 4 December 2017 for term two.If you have any further questions, please contact Stephanie Dutton for BA modules, or Robbie Macaulay for MA modules.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
 The Ancient World degree is one of the most flexible degree programmes covering the Ancient World in the UK. A range of options is offered from across three departments: The field of study of the degree is also defined more broadly than most degrees in this area: the ancient world of the Mediterranean and Near East, since the beginning of written records. It is possible to take courses relating to this field from any of the three participating departments. It is also possible to take a number of “elective” courses on any subject from across the university: students often use this option to study a modern language, the archaeology or history of a different period or place, or any other subject they are interested in (art history, anthropology, English literature, etc).The degree is open to those who have no previous experience of Latin or Greek languages, but all students must take one and a half units in an ancient language during their degree. This is because we believe that the cultures of the ancient world can best be appreciated through exposure to ancient languages, as well as to their literature, history, and archaeology. All students are given the opportunity to reach intermediate level in at least one ancient language, and to experience the diverse approaches to the ancient world offered by the different disciplines of history, archaeology and literary studies. The first year core course Approaches to the Ancient World is intended to introduce the methodologies of these different disciplines. The final year Extended Essay, involving independent study of a topic chosen by you, is the culmination of the degree.The breadth and variety of the degree means that you can make of it what you will. In the first year, students must study the full range of disciplines offered by the degree (Classical language/literature, ancient history, archaeology). Beyond the first year, it is largely up to you how you structure your degree.Many students enjoy taking the full range of disciplines across their three years. Others prefer to concentrate on one discipline. Your first year is the time to experiment and find out where your 
interests lie. You should talk over your course choices with your 
Personal Tutor, and of course you are always most welcome to contact the Ancient World Degree Tutor if you have any questions or 
concerns.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
For the Classics (Q800) degree programme, which requires students to have
an A-level (or equivalent) in Latin or Ancient Greek, students must take at
least one unit of Latin-based
courses, and at least one unit of Greek-based courses.
In addition, there are some compulsory core-courses in the first and second
years involving texts
in translation. The structure for Classics with Year Abroad (Q801) is
identical, except that students spend their third year abroad, and have their
final year at UCL in their fourth year. This gives the following structure: Classics - Sample One This student arrived at UCL with A levels in Latin and Greek. In his first year
he took Latin Texts I as his compulsory unit of Latin language, and Greek Texts
I as his compulsory unit of Greek language. He progressed from Latin Texts I in
his first year, to Latin Texts II in his second, to a prescribed text course in
his final year, in which he also took a number of other high-level Latin
courses. In Greek, he followed a similar progressions: from Greek Texts I in
his first year, to Greek Texts II in his second, to a high-level Greek course (Homer)
in his final year. Like all classicists, he took the core literature survey
courses Interpreting Greek Literature and Interpreting Latin Literature in the
first year, and the Classics and Literary Theory course in the second. As his
interests were very much in the field of classical languages and literature,
almost all his course choices were courses offered by the Department of Greek
and Latin. Classics - Sample Two This student came to UCL with Latin GCE A level, and no prior knowledge of
Greek. In her first year, she took Latin Texts I as her compulsory unit of
Latin language, progressing to Latin Texts II in her second year and to a
prescribed text in her third year. In Greek, she progressed from Greek for
Beginners in her first year, to Intermediate Greek in the second, to Greek
Texts I in her final year. Like all classicists, she took the core literature
survey courses Interpreting Greek Literature and Interpreting Latin Literature
in the first year, and the Classics and Literary Theory course in the second.
This student was also able to pursue her interest in art, taking two courses
outside the Classical World syllabus in her first and second years, and also to
cultivate interests in archaeology and history.

Greek and Latin can be studied in combination with other subjects.  Time is usually split equally between each department.  You can start Greek from scratch for this degree or carry on from your previous studies. Students taking a joint degree with Greek will need to take a minimum of 1 unit of Greek language per year, core courses in their 1st year (CLAS1205 Interpreting Greek Literature) and 2nd year (CLAS2115 Classics and Literary Theory) and the remaining 0.5 unit can be chosen from any of our courses, including courses on Classical Philosophy.An A Level 'A' (or 
equivalent) in Ancient Greek is required. Students

				    Department of Greek & Latin
 There are many excellent institutions at which you can 
study the Classical world - and they are all very different. Each 
institution has its own particular atmosphere and teaching style, and 
offers a particular range of courses. Some will be better suited to your
 own interests and personality than others, so it is a good idea to find
 out as much as you can about the institutions and programmes to which 
you are considering making an application. On this page, you will find links to some primary sources 
of information about the study of the Classical world at UCL, such as 
the Classical World prospectus and the general UCL prospectus,
 but you will also find some more particular information about the 
admissions process for our programmes. If you can't find the information
 you are looking for, or if you have any questions at all, please don't 
hesitate to contact the Undergraduate Admissions Tutor, Dr Fiachra Mac Góráin. UCL Greek and Latin is one of the top-rated Classics 
departments in one of the top-rated universities in the UK, and indeed, 
in the world. Within the department are specialists in the fields of 
literature, philosophy, historiography, linguistics and papyrology, and 
the department's expertise ranges from the earliest beginnings of the 
Classical world to its influence on the art and thought of the present 
day. Our two core BA programmes are The Ancient World programme requires no previous knowledge of Greek or Latin. The Classics with Study Abroad and Ancient World with a Year Abroad programmes offer students the opportunity to spend their third year (of four) studying their subject abroad.  UCL also offers BA programmes in Ancient History and Ancient History and Egyptology run by the Department of History; and a BA in Classical Archaeology run by the UCL Institute of Archaeology. The Department is located close to some of the finest 
resources for the study of the Classical world in Britain: not only does
 UCL have an excellent classics library, but the British Museum, the British Library, Institute of Classical Studies are only a few minutes' walk away. When you need a break from your studies, the University of London's Student Central
 and Fitness centre is just round the corner, and for shopping Tottenham
 Court Road and Oxford Street are in easy walking distance. The UCAS form and afterThe first stage
 of the admissions process is the completion and submission of your UCAS
 form. We will get in touch when your UCAS form arrives to let you know 
that we have received it. If you have included an email address on your 
UCAS form, then we will acknowledge receipt of your application with an 
email to that address. Processing the formsOn the basis of 
these UCAS forms, we then decide to whom we would like to make offers. 
We judge every UCAS form on its own merits, and many factors go into 
this decision, but an enthusiastic personal statement, a good reference,
 good predictions and a strong set of exam results are certainly 
important. Although we try to process decisions as quickly as possible, 
sometimes we are not able to make immediate decisions. If you haven't 
heard from us, this means that we are still considering your 
application. We may have to contact you to request further information, 
so it really is important to check regularly the email address you 
supply on your UCAS form. Open DaysThose who receive offers will
 be invited to one of our departmental open days. In the academic year 2016-17 the open days will take place on 8 February 2017 and 26 
April 2017. The open day usually lasts about four hours (1:30 - 5:30 
pm) and includes talks from staff and students, lunch, sample lectures, 
and tours of UCL given by our current students. It is an excellent 
opportunity to get a feeling for what it would be like to study at UCL, 
and to ask questions. All our programmes are rigorous and broad-ranging degrees 
which qualify students for a remarkably wide variety of jobs. Career 
destinations in recent years have included: teaching, law, computing, 
accountancy, marketing, banking, music (classical and popular - let's 
not forget Chris Martin and Tim Rice-Oxley were both UCL Classicists!), 
acting, the media, business, the voluntary sector, local government, 
politics, and graduate study. The UCL Careers Service provides general 
guidance to students, and there are also a number of specific talks 
aimed at those studying the Classical world. There are a number of UCL open days throughout the year: check the UCL Open-days page for more details. The department also participates in the University of London Taster Courses. If you are very keen to visit the department or talk to 
someone about studying the Classical World at UCL, do get in touch with 
the Admissions Tutor, Dr Fiachra Mac Góráin. All members of the department are happy to give school talks. Feel free to get in touch.

Visting or Affiliate students are students enrolled in a
university outside Britain who study for a year or a term at UCLThe Department of Greek and Latin every year welcomes
visiting students (undergraduate and postgraduate) from around the world. Affiliate students contribute to the distinct character of our Department. The department
has a wide range of courses both in Greek and Latin and in translation, all
available to such students.  Students from European countries usually apply through our
many Erasmus/Socrates links and are usually interested primarily in
courses in Classics. We currently have 
Erasmus agreements with universities in Cyprus (Nicosia), France (Paris IV; 
Strasbourg), Germany (Heidelberg), Greece (Thessaloniki), Hungary 
(EOTVOS, Budapest), Italy (Bologna; Parma; Siena), Spain (Salamanca; 
Valencia), and Switzerland (Geneva). Students from elsewhere in the
world may be Classics majors, but many enrol in individual courses out
of interest. For most of our courses in translation no prior experience
in the study of the Greek and Roman worlds is necessary, but we are
happy to advise. If you have any queries, please contact the the Affiliate Tutor for Greek & Latin, Dr Rosie Harman

				    Department of Greek & Latin
I don't have an A Level (or equivalent) in Greek or Latin -- can I still apply for BA Classics?Without an A Level (or equivalent) in Greek or Latin you cannot apply for the BA Classics.  The BA Ancient World does not require any Greek or Latin and offers the opportunity to start either or both of the languages over the course of the degree.  The courses are not identical, but most of the module options are open to both Classics and Ancient World students.What are the differences between the Classics and Ancient World degrees?The BA Classics has a strong focus on Greek AND Latin language.  Every year you will need to take a minimum of half of your courses in Greek and Latin (which you will need to pass).  You also have core courses in Interpreting Greek and Latin Literature in your first year and Classics and Literary Theory in your second yearThe BA Ancient World is a more interdisciplinary degree, straddling the departments of Greek and Latin (language and literature), History, and Archaeology.  In your first year you will have to take 1 unit (out of 4 in total) in either Greek or Latin language,  at least 1 course in History and at least 1 course in Archaeology.  In your second year you must continue for at least half a unit on your chosen language and in your third year you must complete an extended essay (half a unit) on a subject relevant to your studies (of your choosing).  Other than that, you may choose modules from any of the departments depending on where you find your interests lie.Can I take courses outside of the Ancient World as part of my degree?You may, up to a certain point.  You may take up to 1 unit (out of 4 in total) in your first year and 1 unit over your second and third years combined.  I am not sure about taking my course with a year abroad or not -- can I switch?There is a certain amount of flexibility to opt in or out of the study abroad degree, although your decision must be made by the end of your first year as we make arrangements with host institutions after this time.  There are limits to the number of places we can offer at each host university, so it is best not to leave your decision to move into the year abroad too late. Can I take a subject in combination with another?You can take Greek or Latin as a main language in combination with some degrees (see the Joint Degree list). Neither BA Classics nor BA Ancient World are available in combination with other degrees.How do transfers work?a) Within UCLOnce we have made all of our offers (by the end of March) we cannot accept any transfers (there is the possibility of a transfer at the start of term, but this depends on student numbers). Before this, we may consider a transfer from one programme to another provided you meet the degree pre-requisites.  Requests for transfer should be made to Dr Mac Góráin.b) With other institutionsTransfers can only be made to start your second year and MUST be for an equivalent degree.  Your A Level and GCSE grades must meet our pre-requisites.  If you meet these requirements, you need to first apply through UCAS, indicating second year entry, and then if the admissions tutor is willing to further consider the application youneed to pay a £100 fee and complete the APL form. If you meet all the many requirements for APL and the tutor wishes to offer a place it then needs to be sent to the Dean of Students (Academic) for approval.When will I hear if I have been accepted or not?You will hear from us by the end of March.  Because of the January UCAS deadline, late March is the earliest we can make offers.I've missed the UCAS deadline -- can I still apply?The UCAS deadline (typically mid-way through January) is our final deadline for all programmes.  If you miss this, your only option is to wait and apply the following year.Do you hold interviews?We only hold interviews with applicants under exceptional circumstances.I can't make one of the UCL open days: how else can I visit UCL?Unfortunately we don't have the resources to offer individual tours to students but if you are keen to visit and cannot make one of the central open days you can take the UCL Self-Guided Tour and then visit the Department of Greek and Latin at Gordon House. The Admissions Secretary is based in room G01 on the ground floor and will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the degrees the Department offers.  I haven't met the conditions of my offer: what will happen?We will consider students who are near-misses, but the final decision rests with the Arts and Humanities Faculty, and places are not often given to those who do not get the right grades. By the time you have received your results, a decision will have been made on your application and that will not be reversible unless you gain the right grade by having the relevant papers remarked and the new grade received by the faculty by the end of August that year.UCL will not accept any students with a C grade at A Level, and UCL does not participate in clearing.I have question not listed here -- what do I do?Please email the Classics Office

The Intercollegiate MA in Classics is central to Classics and Ancient 
History in London, and attracts students from across the world. The UCL 
Library (which includes the library of the Institute of Archaeology) is 
excellent, and also contains a dedicated library of Egyptology. The 
British Museum and the British Library are both only ten minutes’ walk 
away from UCL; even closer are the University of London Library at 
Senate House, the library of the Institute of Classical Studies, and the
 library of the Warburg Institute. MA students enrolled at UCL are 
automatically members of the Institute of Classical Studies and entitled
 to use its library, one of the best in the world. We have a large staff
 of international experts in Greek and Latin literature, papyrology, 
ancient history, and classical art and archaeology; all are available to
 supervise or advise MA students in their research. The MA in Classics is an intercollegiate degree-programme, 
taught by the participating Departments of Classics, Greek and Latin, 
and History in King’s College London (KCL), Royal Holloway University of
 London (RHUL), and University College London (UCL). Courses within 
these MAs are available to students registered in any of the 
participating Colleges. Courses from the UCL MA in the Reception of the 
Classical World are also available to students in the Intercollegiate 
MA. In addition, note that:Students take a total of 180 credits divided as follows:(A) Three modules chosen from the list of 
courses approved for the Intercollegiate MA, offered at UCL, KCL, or 
RHUL. Each module carries 40 credits (i.e. each will have an assessment 
weighting of 22%). Of these, Note: both of these requirements may be satisfied by a single course.  (B) A compulsory module CLASG099 Research Methods and Dissertation This module carries 60 credits (assessment weighting 34%), and has two components:Courses below are available to UCL students (and all 
Intercollegiate students at KCL and RHUL): note that courses taken by 
UCL students at KCL or RHUL are subject to the academic regulations and 
procedures of those Colleges. If you take a course at a different 
College, that mark will be reported to UCL and will be incorporated into
 your degree; but the rules under which the mark is arrived at are those
 of the College which provides the course. GREEK AND LATIN† Dedicated modules for the MA Classics * Dedicated modules for the MA Reception of The Classical World⁂ Modules make use of BA teaching (all such courses have a 50%
 minimum MA component).  (Please note that while core courses and language courses will run every
year the availability of all other modules may change from year to year depending on staff availability). 
 
  Credit value: CLASGR12 (Intercollegiate MA): 40 credits, CLASGR12A (Intercollegiate MA - one term only): 20 credits; CLASGR01 (UCL MA students outside Classics): 30 credits; CLASGR12B (UCL MA students outside Classics - one term only): 15 credits; Module Tutor: Professor Maria Wyke Class hours: One two-hour class per week Assessment: CLASGR12: two 5,000-word essays; CLASGR12A: one 5,000 word essay; CLASGR01: two 4,000-word essays; CLASGR12B: one 4,000 word essay Pre-requisites: None Content: The course aims to introduce
students to the principal issues, ideas and methods involved in studying the
reception of the classical world across a range of periods, societies, and
media. It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical
cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use
of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also
aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of
the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding
in this field. The course is taught by a range of experts in classical
reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity
to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The
course also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the
centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.In term 1, ‘reception studies’ and its theoretical
approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within
antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary
reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the
Renaissance up to the present day, with an emphasis on material
culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes
tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are
required to take the whole course (40 credits). Other MA students may take the
whole module or just term 1 as a half module (CLASGR12A 20 credits
intercollegiate; or CLASGR12B 15 credits UCL). Skills: By the end of the course, students will be
expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological
approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to
implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various
historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and
sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in
different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an
understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the
classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques
(including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying
reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques
can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions
of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to
analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective. Preperatory reading: Beard, M. and Henderson, J. Classics: A Very Short Introduction

It will also address the development of the star system, sound technology, the
classical Hollywood style, and the emergence and operation of genre. The course
will utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis,
and engage with issues such as sources, narrative structure, and ideology
(including gender & sexuality, colonialism and religion). Films on the
syllabus include The Last Days of Pompeii
(1913), Ben Hur (1925), Cleopatra (1934) and Quo vadis (1951). Skills: By
the end of the module it is expected that students should have the knowledge
and understanding to (1) identify and analyse cinema’s distinctive techniques
for representing the Roman past; (2) appraise cinema’s techniques of historical
analogy; (3) assess their role in the representation and construction of
contemporary gender, sexuality, morality, and politics; (4) account for cinema’s
transformation of ancient Rome into spectacle and commodity; (5) differentiate
between different cinematic styles in their reconstruction and interpretation
of Roman history. Recommended preperatory reading:Wyke, M. Projecting the Past: Ancient Rome, Cinema

Why did the genre of the Hollywood blockbuster decline in the 1960s and
re-emerge in the twenty-first century? How is cinema changed by the advent of
television, video/DVD, and now the global digital environment? The course will
utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis, and
engage with issues such as tradition, commodification, technology,
contemporaneity (including Cold War ideology, ‘the war on terror’, and
nationalism), and recognition capital. Films on the syllabus include Ben Hur (1959 and 2016), Spartacus (1960);

ancient GreekContent: An introduction to
Mycenaean Greek, including a basic review of Greek historical phonology and
morphology. This course introduces the language, script and history of the
Linear B tablets from Bronze Age Greece: in order to do this effectively it
also serves as a basic introduction to Greek historical phonology and
morphology. By extension, this will include an introduction to Indo-European
studies. A selection of Linear B texts will be studied, with attention to
social, historical and archaeological context: core topics will include the
history of writing in the ancient Aegean and the graphic representation of
Greek; the dialectal affiliations of Mycenaean and Homeric Greek; and the
evidence of the tablets for the history of the Greek language. The course will serve as a
introduction to historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and Indo-European.At the end of the course students
will be able to give an account of the central linguistic issues raised by the
decipherment of the Linear B tablets; will understand how Homeric Greek stands
in relation to Mycenaean and classical Greek; will be familiar with basic linguistic principles and understand how
they inform our analysis of ancient Greek of all periods; will be in a position
to demonstrate how Greek stands in relation to other Indo-European languages.Course texts: a course booklet

devoted to Athenian tragedy of the fifth century BCE, focusing on the theatre
of Sophocles. Apart from the first two hours devoted to
a general introduction to Sophocles and his text, the course
will be organised as a seminar, where we approach the problems of Greek tragedy
and the play through a close collaborative reading, in Greek, of Sophocles'
text. All participants should read the assigned text in
Greek (about 170 lines per session) in preparation for each class.  Also,
a selection of secondary reading has been assigned each week to aid discussion:
participants are asked to get through these selections as well.  This
year, we will focus on the Electra. Topics considered will include
style, interpretation, textual transmission, dramaturgy, the revenge-theme and
the play's connection to other, earlier dramatic and nondramatic versions of
the Orestes story, intertextuality, staging, metre, and social, political and
religious context. For preparation, see
the Cambridge 'Green and Yellow' commentary on the play by J. H. Kells
(available in an inexpensive paperback); the older, but still useful commentary
by Richard Jebb (now published in an a paperback reprint) and the new
commentary by Patrick Finglass (Sophocles,
Electra, Cambridge Classical
Texts and Commentaries vol. 44, Cambridge, 2007).  Skills: Improved
knowledge of tragedy, its contexts and the ancient Greek language; insight into
a variety of important themes connected with Greek drama and its contexts, and
the ability to carry out original research on these questions. Students will
also practice researching a topic of their choice in a mature and independent
way, and will learn the basic techniques of academic research, as well as how
to express their findings well and coherently in writing. Module texts: Sophocles,

course, offered yearly, always focuses on a Greek prose author. This year we
will dedicate ourselves to an intensive study of Aristotle's Poetics, the foundational text of
Western literary criticism and neo-classical poetics. Apart from an initial
two-hour lecture to set the scene, we will focus on a close, collaborative
reading of Aristotle's text in Greek. We will read about five pages of the text
in Greek from week to week. For each week, we will also read some key shorter works
of scholarship on different problems in Aristotle, and I will also bring along
passages which illustrate the development of Greek culture's ways of reflecting
on poetry and poetics up to the philosopher's time, so that we can gain some
notion of the tradition from which the Poetics
springs; and, if time permits, we may read some important passages from the
Rhetoric and Politics as well, which help to illustrate concepts put forward in
the Poetics. Students will be
expected to produce a 5,000-word piece of scholarship, independently
researched, on Aristotle's Poetics and/or
its reception. Students will also be
expected to research and present on key concepts and terms of Aristotelian
theory.    Skills: Insight
into basic questions of literary theory and an understanding of the development
of Greek literary criticism and important themes of the Poetics, as well as the ability to carry out original research on
these questions. Students will also practice researching a topic of their
choice in a mature and independent way, and will learn the basic techniques of
academic research, as well as how to express their findings well and coherently
in writing, and develop facility in making oral presentations in a
non-threatening way.  Recommended preperatory reading:Belfiore, Elizabeth, S., Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion. (Princeton,

This
module will provide an introduction to Cicero the politician and orator as well
a to key elements in the history and political life of the Roman Republic, by a
close look at Cicero’s writings referring to his exile. The course will focus
on reading (in the original Latin) four speeches delivered by Cicero upon his
return (Post reditum in senatu, Post reditum ad Quirites, Pro domo sua, De haruspicum responsis), paying particular attention to his
argument and political strategy and their adaptation in speeches on similar
topics given before different bodies. There will be supplementary reading in
English of some of Cicero’s letters and of excerpts from other speeches. This
will allow for discussion of issues such as aims and methods of Cicero’s
shaping of his persona, his presentation of ‘historical facts’, his view of the
Roman res publica or the possible
reasons for the dissemination of these speeches. Students will be asked
to read about half a speech in Latin per week and one item from the secondary
literature; class discussions each week will be based on this material; there
will also be the chance for students to deliver presentations. Skills:
By
the end of the module, students will be able to read and analyze oratorical
texts within their political and historical context and be able to present
well-argued written and oral conclusions and original ideas. Recommended preperatory reading:D.R. Shackleton

explore two aspects of the interaction between philosophy and literature in the
Classical World. The first is what philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle
have to say about the nature of literature. The second, not unrelated, aspect
is the way that the form and content of ancient philosophy can be seen to be
significantly related. Students will look at a range of texts from across the
ancient canon, including the Presocratics, Plato’s dialogues, Seneca’s letters
and Lucretius’ didactic verse. Those students who are taking this module to
count towards their Language requirement will be expected to engage with the
readings in the original (specifically in their essays). Those students without
Latin or Greek may take this module in translation. Teaching will be balanced
to ensure that it is mostly accessible to everyone. Skills: Students will develop
their ability to criticise and to evaluate arguments, and to present coherent
and extended arguments in writing. They will also develop their sensitivity to
the relationship between the content of an argument and the form in which it is
expressed. Preperatory reading:Barfield,

module will examine the poetry of Ovid, probably the most influential of all
Roman poets on later Western art and literature. It will focus on his great narrative
poem of transformations, the Metamorphoses, examining, amongst other
episodes, the famous stories of Narcissus, Daphne, Philomela, Pygmalion and
Arachne. It will also look at select passages from his other works: his love
poems, the Amores; his versified instruction on pulling the opposite
sex, the Ars amatoria; his
letter-poems written in the voices of famous mythic women, the Heroides; and
his lesser known but equally fascinating works like the Fasti (a
didactic poem on the Roman calendar) and the Tristia (exile poetry).
 Alongside study of passages in the original Latin the course will place
his poetry in its social, historical, and literary context, while also
considering its influence in later periods and its relevance to modern day
concerns. Topics addressed include genre, narrative, style, allusion, humour,
sexuality and gender, violence and aesthetics, Ovid's attitude towards
Augustus, and the post-classical reception of Ovid's poetry in art, film and
literature (including a trip to the National Gallery). Skills:
By the end of the course, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) a
general overview of the style and content of Ovid’s oeuvre in its historical
context, 2) a detailed appreciation of the Metamorphoses
both in the original Latin and in translation and an ability to analyse it from
the perspective of language, genre(s), politics, poetic and philosophical
influences, narrative technique, themes and poetics; 3) an awareness of different
methodological and theoretical approaches to interpreting Ovid’s poetry, an
ability to implement those approaches in practice, and to analyze different
interpretations critically; (4) an appreciation of the post-classical influence
and reception of Ovid’s poetry in a range of historical and cultural contexts. Preperatory reading: Try to read the complete
works of Ovid in translation (the Penguin or World Classics editions are good).

Greek historical writing, taught in English translation (no knowledge of
Ancient Greek language required). In the Classical period prose accounts of the
past were a radical new invention; authoritative narratives about the past had
previously been in verse form, most obviously Homer. The course will examine
how the history of literature changed in this period of huge intellectual
development. We will read the 2 main historical writers of the Classical period
– Herodotus and Thucydides – in literary and cultural context, beginning with
poetic accounts of the past and early experiments in prose, and examining the
interrelation with other genres such as tragedy and rhetoric. The course will
be useful to students coming from a Classics background who have not previously
had much opportunity to study Herodotus or Thucydides and want to understand
more about literary developments of the Classical period, and to students from
an Ancient History background who want to know more about how Classical Greek
history writing works.  Skills: Students will develop
their awareness of critical approaches to history writing, including the
relation of historical content to narrative form and the connections between
historical and other literary genres.

an essay (60%) Pre-requisites: None Content: This module aims
to introduce participants to the study of Greek papyri, documentary as well as
literary, and to offer training in editing them. Each class will focus on a
small number of texts, one or two of which will be studied in detail on a
photograph. The texts are chosen to illustrate the development of Greek cursive
scripts and bookhands; to examine formal aspects of the transmission of Greek
literature on papyrus; and to give an idea of the range of documentary types
available as sources for the history of Egypt from the age of the Ptolemies to
late antiquity.  A good knowledge of Greek is essential.   Skills:  Recommended preperatory reading:  The UCL

students to the principal issues, ideas and methods involved in studying the
reception of the classical world across a range of periods, societies, and
media. It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical
cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use
of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also
aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of
the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding
in this field. The course is taught by a range of experts in classical
reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity
to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The
course also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the
centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.In term 1, ‘reception studies’ and its theoretical
approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within
antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary
reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the
Renaissance up to the present day, with an emphasis on material
culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes
tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are
required to take the whole course (40 credits). Other MA students may take the
whole module or just term 1 as a half module (CLASGR12A 20 credits
intercollegiate; or CLASGR12B 15 credits UCL). Skills: By the end of the course, students will be
expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological
approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to
implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various
historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and
sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in
different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an
understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the
classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques
(including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying
reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques
can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions
of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to
analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective. Preperatory reading: Beard, M. and Henderson, J. Classics: A Very Short Introduction

What
distinguishes cinematic histories of Rome from other historical forms? This
course will explore the early experimental period of filmmaking, its turn to
antiquity to legitimate the new cinematic medium, its relationship to painting,
historical fiction, and theatre, and its distinct methods for bringing
antiquity into the modern world (embodiment, colour, music and movement). 
It will also address the development of the star system, sound technology, the
classical Hollywood style, and the emergence and operation of genre. The course
will utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis,
and engage with issues such as sources, narrative structure, and ideology
(including gender & sexuality, colonialism and religion). Films on the
syllabus include The Last Days of Pompeii
(1913), Ben Hur (1925), Cleopatra (1934) and Quo vadis (1951). Skills: By
the end of the module it is expected that students should have the knowledge
and understanding to (1) identify and analyse cinema’s distinctive techniques
for representing the Roman past; (2) appraise cinema’s techniques of historical
analogy; (3) assess their role in the representation and construction of
contemporary gender, sexuality, morality, and politics; (4) account for cinema’s
transformation of ancient Rome into spectacle and commodity; (5) differentiate
between different cinematic styles in their reconstruction and interpretation
of Roman history. Recommended preperatory reading:Wyke, M. Projecting the Past: Ancient Rome, Cinema

Why did the genre of the Hollywood blockbuster decline in the 1960s and
re-emerge in the twenty-first century? How is cinema changed by the advent of
television, video/DVD, and now the global digital environment? The course will
utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis, and
engage with issues such as tradition, commodification, technology,
contemporaneity (including Cold War ideology, ‘the war on terror’, and
nationalism), and recognition capital. Films on the syllabus include Ben Hur (1959 and 2016), Spartacus (1960);

ancient GreekContent: An introduction to
Mycenaean Greek, including a basic review of Greek historical phonology and
morphology. This course introduces the language, script and history of the
Linear B tablets from Bronze Age Greece: in order to do this effectively it
also serves as a basic introduction to Greek historical phonology and
morphology. By extension, this will include an introduction to Indo-European
studies. A selection of Linear B texts will be studied, with attention to
social, historical and archaeological context: core topics will include the
history of writing in the ancient Aegean and the graphic representation of
Greek; the dialectal affiliations of Mycenaean and Homeric Greek; and the
evidence of the tablets for the history of the Greek language. The course will serve as a
introduction to historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and Indo-European.At the end of the course students
will be able to give an account of the central linguistic issues raised by the
decipherment of the Linear B tablets; will understand how Homeric Greek stands
in relation to Mycenaean and classical Greek; will be familiar with basic linguistic principles and understand how
they inform our analysis of ancient Greek of all periods; will be in a position
to demonstrate how Greek stands in relation to other Indo-European languages.Course texts: a course booklet

devoted to Athenian tragedy of the fifth century BCE, focusing on the theatre
of Sophocles. Apart from the first two hours devoted to
a general introduction to Sophocles and his text, the course
will be organised as a seminar, where we approach the problems of Greek tragedy
and the play through a close collaborative reading, in Greek, of Sophocles'
text. All participants should read the assigned text in
Greek (about 170 lines per session) in preparation for each class.  Also,
a selection of secondary reading has been assigned each week to aid discussion:
participants are asked to get through these selections as well.  This
year, we will focus on the Electra. Topics considered will include
style, interpretation, textual transmission, dramaturgy, the revenge-theme and
the play's connection to other, earlier dramatic and nondramatic versions of
the Orestes story, intertextuality, staging, metre, and social, political and
religious context. For preparation, see
the Cambridge 'Green and Yellow' commentary on the play by J. H. Kells
(available in an inexpensive paperback); the older, but still useful commentary
by Richard Jebb (now published in an a paperback reprint) and the new
commentary by Patrick Finglass (Sophocles,
Electra, Cambridge Classical
Texts and Commentaries vol. 44, Cambridge, 2007).  Skills: Improved
knowledge of tragedy, its contexts and the ancient Greek language; insight into
a variety of important themes connected with Greek drama and its contexts, and
the ability to carry out original research on these questions. Students will
also practice researching a topic of their choice in a mature and independent
way, and will learn the basic techniques of academic research, as well as how
to express their findings well and coherently in writing. Module texts: Sophocles,

course, offered yearly, always focuses on a Greek prose author. This year we
will dedicate ourselves to an intensive study of Aristotle's Poetics, the foundational text of
Western literary criticism and neo-classical poetics. Apart from an initial
two-hour lecture to set the scene, we will focus on a close, collaborative
reading of Aristotle's text in Greek. We will read about five pages of the text
in Greek from week to week. For each week, we will also read some key shorter works
of scholarship on different problems in Aristotle, and I will also bring along
passages which illustrate the development of Greek culture's ways of reflecting
on poetry and poetics up to the philosopher's time, so that we can gain some
notion of the tradition from which the Poetics
springs; and, if time permits, we may read some important passages from the
Rhetoric and Politics as well, which help to illustrate concepts put forward in
the Poetics. Students will be
expected to produce a 5,000-word piece of scholarship, independently
researched, on Aristotle's Poetics and/or
its reception. Students will also be
expected to research and present on key concepts and terms of Aristotelian
theory.    Skills: Insight
into basic questions of literary theory and an understanding of the development
of Greek literary criticism and important themes of the Poetics, as well as the ability to carry out original research on
these questions. Students will also practice researching a topic of their
choice in a mature and independent way, and will learn the basic techniques of
academic research, as well as how to express their findings well and coherently
in writing, and develop facility in making oral presentations in a
non-threatening way.  Recommended preperatory reading:Belfiore, Elizabeth, S., Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion. (Princeton,

This
module will provide an introduction to Cicero the politician and orator as well
a to key elements in the history and political life of the Roman Republic, by a
close look at Cicero’s writings referring to his exile. The course will focus
on reading (in the original Latin) four speeches delivered by Cicero upon his
return (Post reditum in senatu, Post reditum ad Quirites, Pro domo sua, De haruspicum responsis), paying particular attention to his
argument and political strategy and their adaptation in speeches on similar
topics given before different bodies. There will be supplementary reading in
English of some of Cicero’s letters and of excerpts from other speeches. This
will allow for discussion of issues such as aims and methods of Cicero’s
shaping of his persona, his presentation of ‘historical facts’, his view of the
Roman res publica or the possible
reasons for the dissemination of these speeches. Students will be asked
to read about half a speech in Latin per week and one item from the secondary
literature; class discussions each week will be based on this material; there
will also be the chance for students to deliver presentations. Skills:
By
the end of the module, students will be able to read and analyze oratorical
texts within their political and historical context and be able to present
well-argued written and oral conclusions and original ideas. Recommended preperatory reading:D.R. Shackleton

explore two aspects of the interaction between philosophy and literature in the
Classical World. The first is what philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle
have to say about the nature of literature. The second, not unrelated, aspect
is the way that the form and content of ancient philosophy can be seen to be
significantly related. Students will look at a range of texts from across the
ancient canon, including the Presocratics, Plato’s dialogues, Seneca’s letters
and Lucretius’ didactic verse. Those students who are taking this module to
count towards their Language requirement will be expected to engage with the
readings in the original (specifically in their essays). Those students without
Latin or Greek may take this module in translation. Teaching will be balanced
to ensure that it is mostly accessible to everyone. Skills: Students will develop
their ability to criticise and to evaluate arguments, and to present coherent
and extended arguments in writing. They will also develop their sensitivity to
the relationship between the content of an argument and the form in which it is
expressed. Preperatory reading:Barfield,

module will examine the poetry of Ovid, probably the most influential of all
Roman poets on later Western art and literature. It will focus on his great narrative
poem of transformations, the Metamorphoses, examining, amongst other
episodes, the famous stories of Narcissus, Daphne, Philomela, Pygmalion and
Arachne. It will also look at select passages from his other works: his love
poems, the Amores; his versified instruction on pulling the opposite
sex, the Ars amatoria; his
letter-poems written in the voices of famous mythic women, the Heroides; and
his lesser known but equally fascinating works like the Fasti (a
didactic poem on the Roman calendar) and the Tristia (exile poetry).
 Alongside study of passages in the original Latin the course will place
his poetry in its social, historical, and literary context, while also
considering its influence in later periods and its relevance to modern day
concerns. Topics addressed include genre, narrative, style, allusion, humour,
sexuality and gender, violence and aesthetics, Ovid's attitude towards
Augustus, and the post-classical reception of Ovid's poetry in art, film and
literature (including a trip to the National Gallery). Skills:
By the end of the course, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) a
general overview of the style and content of Ovid’s oeuvre in its historical
context, 2) a detailed appreciation of the Metamorphoses
both in the original Latin and in translation and an ability to analyse it from
the perspective of language, genre(s), politics, poetic and philosophical
influences, narrative technique, themes and poetics; 3) an awareness of different
methodological and theoretical approaches to interpreting Ovid’s poetry, an
ability to implement those approaches in practice, and to analyze different
interpretations critically; (4) an appreciation of the post-classical influence
and reception of Ovid’s poetry in a range of historical and cultural contexts. Preperatory reading: Try to read the complete
works of Ovid in translation (the Penguin or World Classics editions are good).

Greek historical writing, taught in English translation (no knowledge of
Ancient Greek language required). In the Classical period prose accounts of the
past were a radical new invention; authoritative narratives about the past had
previously been in verse form, most obviously Homer. The course will examine
how the history of literature changed in this period of huge intellectual
development. We will read the 2 main historical writers of the Classical period
– Herodotus and Thucydides – in literary and cultural context, beginning with
poetic accounts of the past and early experiments in prose, and examining the
interrelation with other genres such as tragedy and rhetoric. The course will
be useful to students coming from a Classics background who have not previously
had much opportunity to study Herodotus or Thucydides and want to understand
more about literary developments of the Classical period, and to students from
an Ancient History background who want to know more about how Classical Greek
history writing works.  Skills: Students will develop
their awareness of critical approaches to history writing, including the
relation of historical content to narrative form and the connections between
historical and other literary genres.  Credit value: CLASGG17 (Intercollegiate MA): 20 credits, CLASGG03 (UCL MA students outside Classics): 30 credits Module Tutor: Professor Nick Gonis Class hours: One two-hour class per week Assessment: Two written assignments:  (1) a 'take-home' exercise in identifying 
published papyri on the basis of electronic resources and translations 
in English of published documents (40%); (2) an edition of a papyrus or 
an essay (60%) Pre-requisites: None Content: This module aims
to introduce participants to the study of Greek papyri, documentary as well as
literary, and to offer training in editing them. Each class will focus on a
small number of texts, one or two of which will be studied in detail on a
photograph. The texts are chosen to illustrate the development of Greek cursive
scripts and bookhands; to examine formal aspects of the transmission of Greek
literature on papyrus; and to give an idea of the range of documentary types
available as sources for the history of Egypt from the age of the Ptolemies to
late antiquity.  A good knowledge of Greek is essential.   Skills:  Recommended preperatory reading:  The UCL

The Intercollegiate MA in Classics is central to Classics and Ancient History in London, and attracts students from across the world. The UCL Library (which includes the library of the Institute of Archaeology) is excellent, and also contains a dedicated library of Egyptology. The British Museum and the British Library are both only ten minutes’ walk away from UCL; even closer are the University of London Library at Senate House, the library of the Institute of Classical Studies, and the library of the Warburg Institute. MA students enrolled at UCL are automatically members of the Institute of Classical Studies and entitled to use its library, one of the best in the world. We have a large staff of international experts in Greek and Latin literature, papyrology, ancient history, and classical art and archaeology; all are available to supervise or advise MA students in their research.

The Department of Greek and Latin has a weekly research seminar, the Lyceum Classics Community Seminar (LCCS), run by postgraduate students (both PhD and MA) for postgraduate students in UCL Department of Greek and Latin. It meets Wednesdays at 4:00pm. The primary aim of this series is to provide both a regular point of social contact among students in the Department and an ideal forum for them to present an overview or aspects of their work. These seminars are also intended to be a relaxed and supportive environment for junior researchers to practice public speaking and develop their communicational and presentational skills.  The LCCS will be running throughout academic year (October to May). Normally presentations will last 20-30 minutes followed by discussions of 15 minutes. We offer free muffins and coffee/ tea to boost morale. Venue: Gordon House G-09Attendance at the seminar counts for one extra point in UCL research log. Abstracts will be circulated ahead of each paper. Staff members who would like to attend please contact the organiser ahead of time. If you have any questions, would like more information, or would like to speak at a future seminar, please contact the organiser Manuela Irarrázabal.

Learning how to be an effective teacher is an important part of a PhD student's training. The Department and the College take this very seriously, and there are a number of training programmes available for students, some compulsory and some elective.The Department aims to offer all PhD students the opportunity to teach. This will not usually happen until the student is in the second year of the PhD programme. PhD students work with a member of staff as a Post-Graduate Teaching Assistant (PGTA): typically this involves dividing the teaching on a large course. All classes with a PGTA will have a complete week-by-week teaching schedule on the Moodle page to make teaching preparation more convenient for the PGTA(s).PGTAs should meet regularly with the course tutor to discuss progress.All postgraduate students are welcome to take training courses in Moodle and other electronic resources with UCL Information Systems.

A: The Graduate Tutor can advise you whether a specialist in your proposed field could supervise you, and can answer any general questions about UCL that you may have. It is good idea to send a draft research proposal when you contact us: one page (more if you wish) with a sketch of your ideas for your PhD
    research. If we feel that we can provide appropriate supervision for you, we will ask you to submit a PhD application so that we can take up references. A: Yes, if you wish.A: All applicants must have completed an MA programme or equivalent post-undergraduate degree, either at UCL or elsewhere. A good performance in the dissertation component of the MA is especially important (for example, in the London MA in Classics we would look for a mark at or near Distinction level). A: The Graduate Tutor can advise on this. Including a piece of writing such as an MA dissertation with an application is often helpful. A:
 The UCL requirement in English for non-native speakers is an IELTS 
score at ‘good’ level or recognised equivalent. Details are available on
 the Graduate School website. (Students who have an undergraduate degree from a university in the English-speaking world are exempt from this requirement.)A: Yes, there is always a sizeable minority of students who have not come immediately out of a BA/MA programme; many join us considerably later in life. We welcome applications from people of all ages; admissions criteria are of course more flexible for mature applicants. A: Yes, around a third of our PhD students enrol as part-time students. It is the best  option for students who need to work while doing the PhD, or who have other responsibilities. Part-time students have seven years rather than the standard four years to complete their dissertations (but may submit before then if they wish).A: Both supervisors must usually be at UCL. The only exception is for universities within London: it is possible to have a second supervisor at King's College London, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University of London, or the School of Advanced Study (London).A: No, though if you are enrolled for a PhD at a foreign university it is possible to be a visiting research student at UCL to work with a member of staff here. A: After we receive a formal application, decisions are made quickly (typically within a month); an offer may specify certain minimum grades in an MA programme or equivalent.A: No, but you should leave yourself plenty of time, especially if you need to apply for funding. For most of the common sources of funding (the AHRC and UCL studentships), you need to have an offer of a place at UCL before your application for funding can be considered. The deadlines for AHRC and UCL funding are typically in late January.A: Most offers of a place are conditional upon MA results: students may be allowed to enrol provisionally in the College in September, on the understanding that this status will lapse if the required marks are not achieved. A: No, though an important advantage in starting at this time is that UCL lays on a number of induction sessions and training courses at the beginning of the year. Some of these are repeated in January for students who need to start then; but it is theoretically possible to start at any time.A: Universities in the UK cannot, unfortunately, offer automatic funding to all PhD students. Funding for research students in the Arts and Humanities at UCL comes mostly from two sources: the AHRC (a UK government body), and a limited number of studentships offered by UCL. Some students also win financial support from private foundations. See our guidelines on postgraduate funding. A: Ancient history at UCL is located in the Department of History, and classical archaeology and art history are based in the UCL Institute of Archaeology: you should apply directly to the History Department or the Institute of Archaeology if that is where your primary research interest lies. However, many projects at PhD level are interdisciplinary: staff in the three Departments collaborate to offer a programme of study of the ancient mediterranean world. If your project includes the study of ancient language, literature, or philosophy as a major element, contact the Department of Greek and Latin: we will arrange for a co-supervisor in ancient history or archaeology as necessary.

To be eligible to apply for an AHRC award you must be ordinarily resident in the UK or European Union. Doctoral awards provide support for up to three years of full-time study, or up to five years of part-time study, to enable students to pursue and complete a programme of doctoral research and gain a doctoral degree. The AHRC expects full-time award holders to submit their doctoral thesis within four years of the start of their award. Part-time students should submit their thesis within seven years. To be eligible to apply for an award under the Doctoral Awards Scheme, you should normally have gained a first degree from a recognised HEI and it is normally expected of you to have, or be studying for, a Master’s degree or similar postgraduate qualification. A full award covers both the cost of tuition fees, up to the Research Council maximum, and a maintenance grant. Arrangements for 2017-18The AHRC-funded London Arts & Humanities Partnership (LAHP) brings together three leading UK research organisations: King’s College London (King’s), the School of Advanced Study (SAS) and University College London (UCL). The LAHP AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership will fund up to 80 research studentships per year across the Arts and Humanities in the three partner institutions. Under the scheme it is possible for research students to have their two supervisors in different LAHP institutions. Applicants: please look at the LAHP website for details. You may also subscribe to the LAHP Twitter account for news updates.For applicants in1) You should be in the process of applying for doctoral research at your chosen institution and have established your supervisor(s) before applying to LAHP for funding. It is important to contact potential supervisors as early as possible. 2) The application system for LAHP funding will open on 27 November 2017 and close 21 January 2017 at midnight. Applications are made via the LAHP website. 3) Applicants for LAPH funding must submit their PhD application to UCL Admissions by 10 January 2018 at the latest. Applications will only be considered if the applicant has been in contact with the Department in the normal way to discuss the research proposal and potential supervisors. This is part of the PhD admission process, and you need to allow enough time for this prior to submitting your application. Last-minute applications that have not been discussed will not be considered for funding. 4) Applicants in  Greek and Latin literature, language, ancient philosophy, reception: please contact the Department of Greek and Latin to discuss your research proposal. 5) Applicants in Ancient History: please contact the Department of History to discuss your research proposal. The LAHP will contact successful applicants in mid-March 2018.The UCL Graduate School offers scholarships to UK/EU students and for oversees students. Up to 15 UCL Graduate School Research Scholarships (GSRS) are available annually to prospective and current UCL MPhil/PhD students from any country. a) You must have submitted an application to UCL for full-or part-time MPhil/PhD research before you can apply. Your application to UCL will be used as the basis of your application for a scholarship. b) The scholarships consist of fees equivalent to the standard postgraduate UK/EU rate plus a maintenance stipend of £15,590 per annum for full-time study. (Benefits are pro-rated for part-time students.) Scholarships are tenable during years 1, 2 and 3 of the MPhil/PhD programme, subject to annual review and renewal. c) Deadline: Friday 5 January 2018. Please send applications to Mr Robbie Macaulay in

All MPhil/PhD students are governed by UCL regulations and procedures as set out in the Academic Manual.All students are initially registered for an MPhil and are transferred to full PhD status on satisfactory completion of the upgrade procedure, which is explained below. There is an Induction Programme in the first week of term for new students: there is an additional orientation programme for international students. Each student is assigned a First and Second supervisor. The exact division of responsibility between the two supervisors is a matter for negotiation. The First Supervisor will have specialist knowledge of the general area of research, and will meet regularly with the student; the Second Supervisor may be in a different Department, if that is useful: s/he will be available for consultation, and will read all chapters and give general advice. In the first year students: a) Work with the supervisors to establish the research project which will be the basis for the dissertation (see §1.4 below)b) Take courses in the Skills Development Programme in the UCL Doctoral School. These include: reading in foreign languages (particularly French and German), bibliographic skills, using databases, writing and presentation skills, and many more. Research training is also offered by the London Arts and Humanities Partnership. c) Attend seminars in the Department, and at the Institute of Classical Studies (see §5 below). All new research students entering UCL are required by the College Graduate School to maintain an online Research Log.All students are required to fill in the Research Log at regular intervals: their Supervisors and the Graduate Tutor have access to the Log and will check that this is done. The Log provides a flexible framework for recording details related to the student's research programme, including supervisory meetings and activities concerning the development of academic and key skills. The Log is designed to help students a) to assess their progress b) to plan the next stage of their researchc) to chart evidence of the development of specific and generic research skills (all courses taken in the UCL Skills Development Programme are logged)In normal circumstances research students have taken a relevant MA degree and are already experienced in devising an original and manageable topic, and, with supervisory advice, completing successfully a research dissertation.  The first step towards defining an MPhil/PhD topic is taken on the application form to the Department. Students receive initial advice from potential supervisors regarding its viability and originality. They subsequently modify, revise and refine the research topic, gradually identifying the contents and direction of each chapter, as well as the overall thrust and argument of the thesis.  In the second year students: a) Work with supervisors in preparation for the Upgrade procedure (see below)b) Are encouraged to teach for the Department, under supervision, in order to acquire teaching skills useful for an academic careerc) Continue to take courses in the Skills Development Programme (see above)d) Are encouraged to attend national and international conference in their field of study (UCL provides funding for this); they often help in the organisation of conferences in the Department.e) Attend seminars in the Department, and at the Institute of Classical Studies (see below). The upgrade to PhD normally occurs in the second year, for full-time students (in the third or fourth year for part-time students). For the upgrade, students are asked to provide written evidence of their research progress, consisting of a draft chapter of approximately 10,000 words, a draft outline of the proposed dissertation and a bibliography. They are then invited to discuss their research with a panel of members of staff. See the UCL upgrade guidelines for full information. The department has a range of exchange links across Europe through the Erasmus scheme, and an exchange scheme with Yale University. These are available to postgraduate research students. In the third year students are busy working with supervisors on the final stages of their research project. They are encouraged to attend seminars and conferences in their field in London and elsewhere: these are an important part of research training. The Classical Association annual general meeting is particularly important in this respect. In and after the second year students  may wish to offer a seminar paper at one of these events. UCL offers funding to PhD students to attend conferences, and for other necessary research purposes.After three years of full-time enrolment (six years part-time), students are entitled to an addition period of registration at UCL without payment of further fees: this is known as Completing Research Status (CRS), and lasts for one year (two years part-time). The thesis must be submitted by the end of the Completing Research period.It is very important to complete your PhD thesis within the allotted time. Extensions will only be granted in exceptional circumstances (illness, etc.).About six months before completion of the thesis, students should submit the examination entry form. This requires discussion with the student’s supervisor(s). The PhD dissertation is examined in a viva voce examination with two Examiners. At least one examiner must be external to UCL: in practice both examiners are usually external to UCL (one is often from another College of the University of London). The Examiners can recommend one of the following options:a) that the dissertation is passed and the candidate is awarded the degree of PhDb) that the dissertation is passed subject to minor correctionsc) that the dissertation be referred for major corrections or rewriting, and is resubmitted within 18 months: a second viva voce exam may be required by the Examiners d) that the dissertation is awarded the degree of MPhil; or that no award is made. The Department hosts seminars and lectures throughout the year. As researchers, students should make every effort to attend these. All Departmental conferences are free to PhD students in the Department of Greek and Latin. Students present their work to the Department (all staff and research students): this takes place in a friendly and informal atmosphere, and is designed to foster presentation skills. All students enrolled in the PhD programme at UCL are members of the Institute of Classical Studies of the University of London. The Institute of Classical Studies runs one of the richest programmes of research in the field of Classics in the world. Students are strongly encouraged to attend the seminars in their field.

Learning how to be an effective teacher is an important part of a PhD student's training. The Department and the College take this very seriously, and there are a number of training programmes available for students, some compulsory and some elective.The Department aims to offer all PhD students the opportunity to teach. This will not usually happen until the student is in the second year of the PhD programme. PhD students work with a member of staff as a Post-Graduate Teaching Assistant (PGTA): typically this involves dividing the teaching on a large course. All classes with a PGTA will have a complete week-by-week teaching schedule on the Moodle page to make teaching preparation more convenient for the PGTA(s).PGTAs should meet regularly with the course tutor to discuss progress.All postgraduate students are welcome to take training courses in Moodle and other electronic resources with UCL Information Systems.

 A study of Classical Greek Language, involving
the reading and translation into English of prose and verse texts, exercise in
grammatical analysis and literary criticism and the translation of English
sentences into Greek. The course is designed for those who already have a good A-level
knowledge of the language or have passed Intermediate Greek B. It prepares
students for studying whole works in the original language and therefore
provides a step towards Greek Texts 2. The module consists of two elements: (i)
Reading of sections of relatively easy texts of classical Greek prose and verse
which are prepared in advanced and worked through in detail in class. This will
include comment on style and grammar. (ii) The systematic study and revision of
the principles of Greek language and syntax, which are best learned by practice
in translating English into Greek. For the verse component of the module,
students will be expected to read 640 lines of Homer; for the prose component,
they will be expected to read around 26 chapters of Herodotus.This module may be
taken as whole unit (two texts) or a half-unit (one text). Students taking the
course as a half-unit are expected to take it in the first term. Anyone
starting the course in the second term may do so only with explicit permission
from the Departmental Tutor.Skills: In addition
to improving their skills at reading and writing ancient Greek, this module
offers students the opportunity to develop their skills at linguistic and
literary analysis and criticism. Value: GREK7006 - 1.0 course unit; GREK7006A - 0.5 course units (both can be retaken,
to study a different text, under the code GREK7016)*Code
GREK7016 needs to be selected on Portico by students who have already taken
GREK7006 and studied different texts and GREK7016A needs to be selected on
Portico by students who have already taken GREK7006A and studied different texts.Course Tutor: Dr P A AgócsClass hours: One two-hour class per week or two one-hour classes per week (TBA), Terms 1 and 2. Pre-requisites:
Normally GREK2006/2006A Greek Texts 1/1A or equivalent.   Assessment: GREK7006: Two pieces of coursework of 2,500
words maximum each (12.5+12.5%=25%) and one unseen three hour examination paper (75%) ; GREK7006A: one piece of coursework of 2,500 words maximum (25%) and one
unseen two-hour examination paper (75%). Pre-requisite:
Normally GREK2006/2006A Greek Texts 1/1A or equivalent.Content: The aim of this
course is to broaden and deepen students' knowledge of two major texts or
important genres of Greek literature in the original language and further to
develop students' ability to read and understand Greek texts in their literary
and historical context. It may be
taken as whole unit (two texts) or a half-unit (one text in either the first or
the second term).  In the first term, we will read
Plato's discussions of poetry, poetics, and literary criticism, focusing on the
Ion and selections from Republic 3 and 10. Questions to consider will include the origins
of Greek literary theory and notions of art and the work of art; orality and
literacy (performance and text); the theory of mimesis; the ambiguities of the philosopher's argument; poetry,
inspiration and the Muses; the meaning and authority of the Homeric tradition,
the political, ethical and social role of poetry and its place in Plato's
philosophy and political theory; the 'quarrel of poetry and philosophy'; and
the impact of Plato's theories on the development of Western literary
criticism. In the second term, we will read a selection of Homeric Hymns, late archaic hexameter hymns dedicated to various
gods. Questions to consider will include the history of the text; the function of
the poetry in its original contexts of performance; analysis of poetic form and
style; Greek religion, religious discourse, myth and aetiology; the development
of the hexameter ('epic') poetic tradition after the songs of Homer; the
political role of cults and sanctuaries in the archaic period; the influence of
Near Eastern poetic and religious traditions on Greek myth, and other relevant
themes. Text and commentary for each term:1) for term one, we will read Penelope Murray, Plato On Poetry (Cambridge Greek and Latin Texts: Cambridge, 1996).2) in term two: Nicholas Richardson, Three
Homeric Hymns: To Apollo, Hermes, Aphrodite (Cambridge Greek and Latin
Texts, 2010). Skills: By the end of the course, students should be trained in close reading, analysis
of form, content and context, and the ability to present written conclusions
about a complex body of data in a coherent fashion. They will also have better
Greek than they had when they started, and will be able to carry out
independent research into the important themes of Greek and modern poetics, and
ancient Greek poetry, culture, myth and religion. Introductory readings: For term 1: Thomas Szlezák, Reading Plato (Routledge, 1999); Eric Havelock, Preface to Plato (Harvard, 1963);
Stephen Halliwell, The
Aesthetics of Mimesis. Ancient Texts and Modern Problems (Princeton 2002); A. Ford, The
Origins of Criticism (Princeton, 2001).For term 2: Jenny Strauss Clay, The Politics of Olympus: Form and Meaning in the Major Homeric Hymns
(London, 2006); Richard Janko, Homer,
Hesiod and the Hymns (Cambridge, 1982); J. Notopoulos, 'The Homeric Hymns
as Oral Poetry', American Journal of
Philology 83 (1962): 337-368; W. Burkert, Greek Religion (Harvard, 1985).Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutors: Dr Nicolò Benzi (Term 1) and Professor Nick Gonis (Term 2) Class hours: One one-hour class
per week, Terms 1 and 2.  Assessment: One three-hour
examination paper (100%) Pre-requisite: GREK2002 Intermediate
Greek B or equivalent Content: A course of exercises and discussions designed to
improve fluency of unprepared translation into English from Greek prose and
verse authors. Weekly classes provide practice in unseen translation of a
wide-ranging selection of Greek prose and verse authors. Classwork focuses upon
discussion of grammar and grammatical style, common pitfalls and hints about
translation techniques as well as practical exercises. Skills: By the end of the course students will have had
sufficient practice to be able to apply their knowledge and thus make
reasonable assumptions regarding the content of an unseen passage. Value: 1.0 course unitsCourse
Tutor: Prof. Stephen
Colvin Class hours: One two-hour class
per week, Terms 1 and 2.  Assessment: On unseen three-hour written exam (100%).  Formative assessment: One problem
sheet per week (to be handed in the following week). Pre-requisites: Two years of
ancient Greek Content: An introduction to
Mycenaean Greek, including a basic review of Greek historical phonology and
morphology. This course introduces the language, script and history of the
Linear B tablets from Bronze Age Greece: in order to do this effectively it
also serves as a basic introduction to Greek historical phonology and
morphology. By extension, this will include an introduction to Indo-European
studies. A selection of Linear B texts will be studied, with attention to
social, historical and archaeological context: core topics will include the
history of writing in the ancient Aegean and the graphic representation of
Greek; the dialectal affiliations of Mycenaean and Homeric Greek; and the
evidence of the tablets for the history of the Greek language.  The course will serve as a
introduction to historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and Indo-European. Course texts: a course booklet
will be supplied. S. COLVIN,  A
Historical Greek Reader (Oxford 2007): not necessary to purchase J.T. HOOKER, Linear B: an introduction (Bristol 1980): recommended Other recommended preparatory
readings: J. CHADWICK, The Decipherment of Linear B

week, Term 2. Assessment: One unseen three-hour
examination paper (100%) Pre-requisites: Normally GREK2006/2006A
Greek Texts 1/1A or equivalentContent: An introduction to the
study of Greek papyri, documentary as well as literary, each class will focus
on a small number of texts, one or two of which will be studied in detail on a
photograph. The texts are chosen to illustrate the development of Greek book hands
and cursive scripts; to examine formal aspects of the transmission of Greek
literature on papyrus; and to give an idea of the range of documentary types
available as sources for the history of Graeco-Roman Egypt.Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutor: Dr Antony
Makrinos Class hours: One
two-hour class per week, Term 1.  Assessment: One
piece of coursework of 2,500 words maximum (25%) and one unseen two-hour examination
paper (75%). The coursework is a critical analysis of one of the essay titles
provided; the exam involves commentaries and essays.Pre-requisites: Normally GREK 2006/2006A Greek Texts 1/1A or
equivalent. Content: The
course will focus on discussing Homer’s Iliad
in the original. Issues discussed will include the composition of oral poetry,
structure, plot and character, the idea of heroism, the theme of war, the role
of the gods, gender and social values, the reception of Homer in later ages. In
this course we will follow Achilles coming back to the war and mercilessly
killing the Trojans now that Hector has killed Achilles. We will follow the
duel between Achilles and Hector, the killing of Hector and the funeral games
for dead Patroclus. Finally we will examine Priam’s supplication of Achilles
for the body of Hector and our reading will end with Hector’s funeral.We will read the Greek text together (some parts
will be left for independent study). Areas to investigate will include the
nature of epic; the traditionality of Homer; the differences between oral and
written texts and the cultures that make them; the epic hero (Achilles, Hector);
fiction and truth; poetry and 'song'; ideas of war, space and time; gods and
goddesses; death and the afterlife; magic and religion; Homeric society and
ethics; men and women in epic; and the impact of the Iliad on the later tradition in poetry and art. We will aim to cover Books 21-24 of the
Iliad in the original Greek. We will use the Oxford
Classical Texts edition of T. Allen. Translation:
R. Lattimore, The Iliad of Homer, (Chicago
and London, 1951). Commentaries: G. S. Kirk, The Iliad: A Commentary, (Cambridge 1985-1993), esp. vol. 6 by N.
Richardson covering books 21-24, N. Postlethwaite, Homer’s Iliad: a
commentary on the translation of Richmond Lattimore (Exeter 2000). Companions: R. Fowler, The Cambridge Companion to Homer (Cambridge 2005); P. B.
Powell-I.Morris, A New Companion to Homer (Leiden 1997); Grammar:
D. B. Monro, Homeric Grammar (Bristol
Classical Press, 2013); Dictionary: G. Autenrieth, Homeric Dictionary,
(Duckworth, 1998). Recommended secondary readings: R.
Rutherford, Homer. Greece & Rome
New Surveys in the Classics (Cambridge 1996); A.B. Lord, The Singer of Tales (Harvard University
Press 1960; re-issued since); J. Griffin, Homer
on Life and Death, (Oxford 1980); B. Graziosi, Homer
(Oxford 2016); M. Mueller, The Iliad. Second edition
(London 2009); M. Silk, Homer: The Iliad (Cambridge 1987).Skills:
By
the end of the course, students will engage with
Homeric ideas as explored in the Iliad
and with their reception in secondary literature. In this way they will gain an
understanding of concepts and theories produced by the Homeric epics. They will
also concentrate on primary materials and develop the ability to read Homeric
Greek independently, to manage their own learning, to communicate ideas in
writing and to gather, present, analyze and synthesize data. Independent
thinking will also be strongly encouraged in order to enable student
development and achievement.Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutor: Dr Peter AgócsAssessment: An essay
of 6,000 words maximum (including footnotes
and excluding bibliography) on a subject related to one or more of the courses being
taken by the candidate in the Final-year. Content: After a
general meeting organised by the Ancient World Tutor, a preliminary title must
be submitted in writing to the Ancient World Tutor for approval, after which an
appropriate supervisor will be assigned. Students should arrange to meet their
supervisors at the end of the first term for an initial discussion, then again
at the beginning of the second term, to discuss abstract and bibliography,
followed by further meetings (normally about two) to discuss drafts over the
remainder of term 2. If students would like their supervisors to read any full
drafts, these should be submitted two weeks before the end of tem 2 at the
latest; availability of supervisors during the Easter vacation cannot be
guaranteed.Please note, all lists on this page are provisional. Module options and the details
 contained within each will be finalised as soon as possible. Compulsory modules and
standard language modules will be offered every year. The range of theme- and
author-based modules can vary from year to year, depending on staff
availability, and in the interest of a rich curriculum. A detailed list of
modules running in the coming academic year will normally be available in early
spring of the preceding year
    This is a call for proposals for a half-day

Intermediate Latin B or Latin to A-level standard or equivalentContent:
This
module offers study of classical Latin language, involving the reading and
translation into English of prose and verse texts, exercises in grammatical
analysis and stylistic criticism, the translation of English sentences into
Latin, and the scansion of hexameter and elegiac verse. The course is designed
for those who already have a good A-level knowledge of the language or have
passed Intermediate Latin B. It prepares students for studying whole works in
the original language and therefore provides a step towards Latin Texts 2. The module consists of two
elements:(i) Reading of extended
sections of relatively straightforward texts of classical Latin prose and verse,
which are prepared in advance and worked through in detail in class. This will
include comment on style and grammar (two hours per with main tutor).(ii) The systematic study
and revision of the principles of Latin grammar syntax, which is practiced by translating
English into Latin (one hour per week with PGTA).Student will be expected
to have read the entire set texts by the end of the relevant term; a few pages
of Latin will have to be prepared every week.The module may be taken
as whole unit (two texts) or a half-unit (one text). Students taking the course
as a half-unit are expected to take it in the first term. Anyone starting the
course in the second term may do so only following advice from the Departmental
Tutor.Skills:
By
the end of the module, students should have a good knowledge of classical Latin
language, be trained to translate fluently from Latin into English and from
English into Latin and be able to analyze linguistic features of a text in
relation to its content.Course texts: Text term 1: K. Quinn

class per week across two termsAssessment: one three-hour examination paper (100%)Pre-requisites: students should have a strong and
confident grasp of Latin grammar and syntax, and have completed satisfactorily
‘LATN 2008 Latin Texts 1’ or equivalent.Course descriptionThis course aims to enable students to
acquire the principles and techniques of writing Latin prose (translation from
English). We will use the text-book North and Hillard, Latin Prose
Composition (often reprinted, and available online on the moodle for this
course). To begin with, we will revise the more complex constructions of Latin
syntax, and translate sample sentences from English into Latin. After the first
few weeks, we will proceed to translating passages of around 200 words, and
eventually, we will move onto translating more extended passages of English
prose. Each week, for homework, students will be expected to translate
sentences or passages from English into Latin, and to revise their knowledge of
Latin accidence. In class, we will test the students’ knowledge of accidence,
go over the homework, and cover new topics in Latin syntax.  Skills:
Students will develop
their ability to express themselves in writing, to analyse sentence structures,
and to solve complex problems by applying extensive memorized information.Introductory reading: North and Hillard, Latin Prose

A survey course designed to give an overview of the range, variety and quality
of Latin prose and poetry from the late Roman empire to the Middle Ages.  The course aims to
introduce students to a selection of late and Medieval Latin writings and to
equip them to appreciate basic linguistic characteristics as well as the
cultural and historical backgrounds of these texts. The linguistic element will concentrate on
pointing out some basic differences between Medieval Latin and Classical Latin;
students should be sufficiently proficient in Latin to appreciate these
differences and to translate the texts. Greater attention will be placed on introducing the historic and
cultural context of the texts and their authors on the assumption that students
will have a limited knowledge of the Middle Ages. Skills: Participants will develop the ability to
discriminate between different registers of a language and to follow its
evolution over time, as well as to relate literary and linguistic trends to
their cultural context.Course

there are only 20 places available. The aim of the course is to introduce
students to the materials and methods employed in the production of written
documents on stone, papyrus and parchment and to familiarize them with the
historical development of Latin scripts. These include Roman capitals and cursives, and Insular, Merovingian,
Caroline, Beneventan and Gothic scripts. This course will also train students in the skills of identifying
different writing styles and transcribing Latin texts. At the
end of the course, students should be able to identify, date and transcribe
scripts such as these:Skills: Participants will

Texts 1 (or equivalent indicator of advanced knowledge of Latin)Content: This course
investigates the relationship between Latin poetry and its English translations
through close study of a selection of Horace’s Odes. Consideration will be
given to the differences between the Latin and English languages, their
respective techniques for producing poetic discourse, the historical context of
individual translations, and their nature as a mode of reception. Class
discussion will include literary analysis of the source text as well as a
number of its translations ranging from the early modern period to the present
day. Students will be required to prepare their own translations of a
prescribed poem or poems from Horace’s Odes
and to do some background reading of secondary sources in advance of each
session.Skills: The course aims (1) to develop
students’ linguistic and critical reading skills both in relation to works of
Latin poetry in the original and to their English translations; (2) to
discern the effects on poetic production of different language structures;
(3) to evaluate Latin poetry and its translations in their social and
cultural contexts; (4) to understand the strategies and the processes of
translation; (5) to assess translation as a mode of reception of Latin
literature.Suggested

introduction to the study of Greek mythology in its literary, social,
historical and philosophical context. The aim of this course is to introduce
students to leading concepts and persons of Greek mythology, which form an
important foundation of Greek art, literature and ideas. Everyone is fascinated
by Greek myths: but how did these extraordinary stories arise? What was their
purpose? Did the Greeks really believe them and what are our sources for them?
This course looks at a range of Greek myths and suggests some answers to these
questions. Backed up by slides and copies of relevant texts, the course will
survey the subject broadly, evaluating some modern interpretations of myth. Course texts: Morford,

places for first-year students on other degree programmes might be available
upon approval of the Course Tutor. Content: This
course is an exploration of the history of Greek and Roman ideas, which formed
the modern world. In the first half of the term sessions will focus on Greek
ideas like heroism, democracy, oligarchy, hospitality, fair play, athletics,
tragedy, comedy, eros and love, philosophy, and how these ideas have been
generated through specific Greek cultural systems.In the second half of the term we shall be concerned with Roman ideas
and sessions will focus on ideas like fame, liberty, virtue, justice, epicureanism,
stoicism, citizenship, republicanism, imperialism, public order and how they
have been generated through specific Roman cultural systems. The sessions will
then examine the relevance of these ideas to modern politics and society. Twice weekly classes take as a starting point selected readings from
major authors; the format is mixed lecture and discussion. All texts will be
supplied in electronic form. Skills: By the end
of the course, students will engage with classical
ideas as explored in primary sources and with their reception in secondary
literature. In this way they will gain an understanding of concepts and
theories produced by these sources. They will also concentrate on primary
materials and develop the ability to read texts independently, to manage their
own learning, to communicate ideas orally and in writing and to gather, analyze
and synthesize data. Teamwork and independent thinking will also be strongly
encouraged in order to enable student development and achievement.Introductory reading: C. Pelling

course is designed for students in Comparative Literature and in Greek and
Latin.  There will be a mixture of ancient and non-ancient texts.
 All texts will be read in English, though parallel texts in the original
languages may also be supplied.

The texts that we shall read in this course are concerned with cultural
difference.  Each text was written by an individual in one culture, but
each deals with individuals or communities of another culture.  How does
one culture think about another culture, and what is at stake in cross-cultural
representation? What does the cross-cultural representation say about the
author’s own culture? What kind of identity and value do cultures impart to
other cultures? How do texts deal with the problem of cross-cultural
representation? We approach this set of questions through the literature of
travel. The themes that we shall consider include the figure of the traveller,
exoticism, ethnography, translation, tourism and colonialism.   Running
through these themes is a focus on the concept of the foreigner, and we shall
examine the foreigner as he/she/it appears in texts from different cultures and
periods.  What is a foreigner?  How was the idea of the foreigner
first proposed?  What are the consequences of this idea in the West?
 What do words such as “barbarian” or “savage” signify and how are they
related to the concept of the foreign?  We shall attempt to ascertain the
influence of these notions on Western thought and literature, and at the same
time we shall ask if there are non-Western ways of approaching the problem of
cultural difference. The course will
consider how the idea of the other is complicated by issues of gender,
sexuality, race, nation, and modernity.  We shall also examine the problem
for what it has to say to people such as ourselves who live in a multicultural
society.Readings
may include the following: Exodus (from the Bible); Homer, Odyssey; Dante, Inferno; the
writings of Christopher Columbus; Shakespeare, The Tempest; and Claude Lévi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques.

The Year Abroad Dissertation is an essential part of the Year Abroad Study Programme should be a maximum of 8,000 words long, including footnotes and excluding bibliography. 2. The dissertation must be a substantial piece of work for full-unit credit, and its subject must be connected to one of your study abroad courses. A general meeting to provide information regarding the Year Abroad Dissertation will be organised by the Year Abroad Tutor during revision week in the year before the year abroad. 3. You will discuss the themes that interest you with the Year Abroad Tutor either before you leave, or shortly after your arrival at your host university. After you agree on and submit a theme, you will be allocated a supervisor with whom you will discuss your proposed subject. Supervisory meetings may be held by email or Skype. You should consult your supervisor about the title of the dissertation and its scope, organisation and standard, and seek advice on the bibliography. The supervisor should be shown a preliminary outline. Supervisors will then look at a draft of a particular section once (only) and will provide written comments, i.e. parts revised in the light of comments by the supervisor will not receive further comment in writing. The draft(s) may be sent to the supervisor by e-mail, who will respond with comments or embed them in the received electronic version.Students should not expect supervisors to be able to read and comment on substantial drafts submitted for the first time late in term 2 and availability of supervisors during the Easter vacation cannot be guaranteed. It is the student’s responsibility to prepare well in advance and follow the dates outlined in the submission schedule.

two pieces of coursework of 2,500 words maximum each (50% each).Pre-requisites: NoneContent: This course offers an introduction to early Greek philosophy, from
Ionian physical enquiry to the Sophists. The course will initially provide a
background to early Greek philosophy, by considering its dialectical relation
to the intellectual and cultural milieu of Archaic Greece. Students will then
be introduced to the philosophical doctrines of a range of authors, including
Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Empedocles,
Anaxagoras, Democritus, Protagoras and Gorgias. By touching on matters of
physics (the study of nature and natural change), epistemology (the study of
knowledge) and ontology (the study of being), the course will help students
understand the origins of philosophical speculation and the fundamental questions
which informed the later development of the discipline.Skills: Students will learn methods of argument reconstruction,
approaches to critical analysis of texts, and how to approach fragmentary
sources successfully.Course texts: R. McKirahan (Hackett, 2011) Philosophy

importance of comedy. Issues of content, political, religious and social
context, as well as comic convention and the evolution of the comic genre will
be discussed and analysed in class.   Skills:
By the end of the
module, the students should have learnt how to engage in close reading of the
texts and make effective use of secondary bibliography in order to analyse and
understand the content and context of Greek comedy. They should be able to read
the texts independently and present their conclusions in a coherent and
thoughtful manner both orally and in writing.  Introductory

This
module will focus on reading and discussing primary sources in translation. The
texts will be taken partly from Michael Trapp’s anthology (see below) and
additional sources to be made available on Moodle. About six to eight letters
(or extracts of letters) will be read every week, along with one article or
book chapter form the secondary literature.The module will offer a
survey of the traditions and evolution of the epistolary genre, analysing
samples from Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Seneca the Younger, Pliny the Younger,
Fronto and elsewhere. For individual letters, issues such as characterisation,
rhetorical strategy, imagery, humour, manipulation and emotional response
(whether of the original addressee or the wider audience) will be considered.The surviving body of
letters form the ancient world is extraordinarily rich and diverse. From
official imperial correspondence to fictionalised letters embedded in larger
works (particularly historiographical narratives and novels), letters, whether
real or invented, can in different ways inform, teach, entertain, and shock.
The genre is remarkably flexible, incorporating pieces written in prose or
verse, and in Latin or Greek. As the boundaries of the Greco-Roman world
expanded under the empire, individuals found that they needed to communicate
over considerable distances, and the ‘epistolary habit’ really came into its own.
The ubiquitous presence of letters in real life (even pieces faked for the
purposes of propaganda) in turn guaranteed a receptive audience for literary
letters.Skills:
By
the end of the module, students should be trained in close reading, analysis of
form, content and context, and the ability to present written and oral

course builds on the first-year courses Interpreting Latin Literature and
Interpreting Greek Literature and is designed to provide a general critical
background to the author and theme-based literature courses taught both in the
original language and in translation. The course will analyse ways in which a
range of modern critical techniques (including reception theory, feminist
criticism, structuralism, post-colonialism) can enhance our reading of Greek
and Latin texts. Emphasis will placed be on the relationship between these
different approaches and a specific selection of texts across a range of Greek

course, taught in English translation, examines the work of the Classical Greek
prose writer Xenophon in cultural, political and literary context. An Athenian
writer, Xenophon travelled widely across the Greek world and Asia Minor, and
wrote about his experiences with different cultures, both Greek and non-Greek.
His texts discuss controversial issues of his day – conflict between Greeks,
Spartan society and power, Persian imperialism, relations with foreign lands,
and citizenly behaviour in Athens. Unlike most writers from his period, he
wrote across a wide range of genres, such as history, philosophical dialogue
and rhetoric, as well introducing new forms such as travel writing, biography
and the novel. The course will examine a range of his texts, considering the
relationship between cultural representation, politics and literary form, and
addressing questions of Greek identity, concepts of Otherness, power relations
and class consciousness in the context of the development of Classical Greek
prose writing. Skills:
Students will develop their awareness of critical approaches to texts, their
understanding of the relations between form, content and context, and their
ability in close reading and in oral and written analysis.Introductory

course offers an introduction to Plato's philosophical dialogues, with a
particular focus on the early and middle works, including the Republic. It considers both the
philosophical and the literary aspects of the dialogues and the fundamental ways
in which these coincide. Covering a range of dialogues including the Euthyphro, Gorgias, Meno, Phaedo, Symposium and Republic,
the course touches on questions of ethics, metaphysics, epistemology and
Socratic and Platonic philosophy generally.  Skills: At the end of the course, students should be able to give
an account of Plato’s discussion of specific philosophical issues; give an
account of Plato’s literary and dramatic technique; discuss the relation
between different dialogues and indicate its possible significance.Preparatory

 The focus is on the relationship between literary epic
and political ideology.  How do epic poems relate to
authority?  How do the romance and imperial traditions coexist in
poetry?  How does political patronage overlap with
literary patronage?  And more generally, what is the
relationship between politics and literature?  We shall pay attention to
the social and historical contexts in which epic poems took shape and
circulated.  We shall also be concerned with questions of
gender, religion, identity, transmission, and literary form.  The
course will consider work from different cultural traditions.
 All texts will be read in translation.   Readings may include the following: Homer, Iliad and Odyssey; Virgil,
Aeneid; Derek Walcott, Omeros. N.B This course is designed for final year students. Second-year students may only take it with
the special permission of the Departmental Tutor.Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutor: Dr Peter AgócsAssessment: An essay

taken by the candidate in the Final-year. Content: After a
general meeting organised by the Ancient World Tutor, a preliminary title must
be submitted in writing to the Ancient World Tutor for approval, after which an
appropriate supervisor will be assigned. Students should arrange to meet their
supervisors at the end of the first term for an initial discussion, then again
at the beginning of the second term, to discuss abstract and bibliography,
followed by further meetings (normally about two) to discuss drafts over the
remainder of term 2. If students would like their supervisors to read any full
drafts, these should be submitted two weeks before the end of tem 2 at the
latest; availability of supervisors during the Easter vacation cannot be
guaranteed.Notes:  Students who are
writing primarily about Greek texts in the original may choose to take GREK3005

academic requirements during the Year Abroad for students who began their
degrees in 2015/16 and earlier, and for students beginning their degrees in
2016/17. The differences will be noted where relevant below. a) These degrees have the same rules as
three-year Classics and Ancient World degrees (respectively) in Year 1, Year 2
and Year 4 (where the rules for Year 3 of three-year degrees apply), except
that, in Years 1 and 2, candidates must study at the appropriate level the
language of the country they intend to visit in Year 3. b) Progression to Year 3 Study/Year Abroad is subject to satisfactory
performance in Years 1 and 2 (i.e. requirements for progression must be met).
Additionally, students must have completed the ‘Preparation for Study Abroad
Programme’ in the spring of Year 2. c)
Candidates who began their degrees in 2015/16 or earlier must take CLAS3902
Year Abroad Dissertation (1 unit) and 2 ‘shell-course units’ in Year  d)
For these candidates, progression to Year 4 is conditional on completion and
passing of CLAS3902 and on the completion of the 2 ‘shell-course units’. Candidates
beginning their degrees in 2016/17 must take 2 ‘shell-course units’ in Year 3.
For these candidates, progression to Year 4 is conditional on the completion of
the 2 ‘shell-course units’. e)
For candidates who began their degrees in 2015/16 or earlier, assessment of the
degree as a whole is as for the 3-Year Classics and Ancient World Degrees,
except that CLAS3902 counts as fifth Year 4 unit. For
candidates beginning their degrees in 2016/17, assessment of the degree as a
whole is as for the 3-Year Classics and Ancient World Degrees. f) Candidates who
have not previously studied the modern language of the country they intend to
visit must complete at least 1.5 course units of this language during Years 1
and 2 (i.e. 1.5 course units across the two years, not 1.5 course units each
year) or provide satisfactory documentation of an
equivalent engagement with this language outside of the UCL course units at the
end of each academic year (e.g. via external language classes or tutoring).g) Candidates who
have a GCSE or A-Level in the modern language of the country they intend to
visit must complete at least 1 unit of this language during Years 1 and 2 (with
at least 0.5 course units in Year 2) or provide
satisfactory documentation of an equivalent engagement with this language
outside of the UCL course units at the end of each academic year (e.g. via
external language classes or tutoring). Exceptionally, by
the permission of the Year Abroad Tutor this requirement
can be reduced to 0.5 course units in Year 2 (or equivalent) for those who have
an A-Level (or equivalent).h) Subject to the approval of their Degree Tutor, candidates may be
permitted to take 1 course unit of the language (or literature taught in the
original language) of their Year 3 Host country at an appropriate level in Year
4 (in addition to selection of modules outside the Classics/Ancient World field
of study permitted under the degree rules).These rules refer to the GREEK AND LATIN side of your degree:CLAS1301 Introduction to

course builds on the first-year courses Interpreting Latin Literature and
Interpreting Greek Literature and is designed to provide a general critical
background to the author and theme-based literature courses taught both in the
original language and in translation. The course will analyse ways in which a
range of modern critical techniques (including reception theory, feminist
criticism, structuralism, post-colonialism) can enhance our reading of Greek
and Latin texts. Emphasis will placed be on the relationship between these
different approaches and a specific selection of texts across a range of Greek
and Roman authors, periods and genres.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
The Ancient World degree is one of the most flexible 
degree programmes covering the Ancient World in the UK. A range of 
options is offered from across three departments:  The field of study of the degree is also defined more 
broadly than most degrees in this area: the ancient world of the 
Mediterranean and Near East, since the beginning of written records. It 
is possible to take courses relating to this field from any of the three
 participating departments. It is also possible to take a number of 
“elective” courses on any subject from across the university: students 
often use this option to study a modern language, the archaeology or 
history of a different period or place, or any other subject they are 
interested in (art history, anthropology, English literature, etc). The degree is open to those who have no previous experience of Latin or Greek languages, but all students must take one and a half units in an ancient language
 during their degree. This is because we believe that the cultures of 
the ancient world can best be appreciated through exposure to ancient 
languages, as well as to their literature, history, and archaeology. All
 students are given the opportunity to reach intermediate level in at 
least one ancient language, and to experience the diverse approaches to 
the ancient world offered by the different disciplines of history, 
archaeology and literary studies. The first year core course Approaches to the Ancient World
 is intended to introduce the methodologies of these different 
disciplines. The final year Extended Essay, involving independent study 
of a topic chosen by you, is the culmination of the degree. The breadth and variety of the degree means that you can 
make of it what you will. In the first year, students must study the 
full range of disciplines offered by the degree (Classical 
language/literature, ancient history, archaeology). Beyond the first 
year, it is largely up to you how you structure your degree. Many students enjoy taking the full range of disciplines 
across their three years. Others prefer to concentrate on one 
discipline.  Your first year is the time to experiment and find out 
where your 
interests lie. You should talk over your course choices with your 
Personal Tutor, and of course you are always most welcome to contact the
 Ancient World Degree Tutor if you have any questions or 
concerns. Professor Phiroze VasuniaAll staff at UCL (Ancient World)
    This is a call for proposals for a half-day
interdisciplinary workshop to be held on the afternoon of 21st February 2018 at UCL on the topic of ‘Rejecting the

				    Department of Greek & Latin
For the Classics (Q800) degree programme, which requires students to have
an A-level (or equivalent) in Latin or Ancient Greek, students must take at
least one unit of Latin-based
courses, and at least one unit of Greek-based courses.
In addition, there are some compulsory core-courses in the first and second
years involving texts
in translation. The structure for Classics with Year Abroad (Q801) is
identical, except that students spend their third year abroad, and have their
final year at UCL in their fourth year. This gives the following structure: Classics - Sample One This student arrived at UCL with A levels in Latin and Greek. In his first year
he took Latin Texts I as his compulsory unit of Latin language, and Greek Texts
I as his compulsory unit of Greek language. He progressed from Latin Texts I in
his first year, to Latin Texts II in his second, to a prescribed text course in
his final year, in which he also took a number of other high-level Latin
courses. In Greek, he followed a similar progressions: from Greek Texts I in
his first year, to Greek Texts II in his second, to a high-level Greek course (Homer)
in his final year. Like all classicists, he took the core literature survey
courses Interpreting Greek Literature and Interpreting Latin Literature in the
first year, and the Classics and Literary Theory course in the second. As his
interests were very much in the field of classical languages and literature,
almost all his course choices were courses offered by the Department of Greek
and Latin. Classics - Sample Two This student came to UCL with Latin GCE A level, and no prior knowledge of
Greek. In her first year, she took Latin Texts I as her compulsory unit of
Latin language, progressing to Latin Texts II in her second year and to a
prescribed text in her third year. In Greek, she progressed from Greek for
Beginners in her first year, to Intermediate Greek in the second, to Greek
Texts I in her final year. Like all classicists, she took the core literature
survey courses Interpreting Greek Literature and Interpreting Latin Literature
in the first year, and the Classics and Literary Theory course in the second.
This student was also able to pursue her interest in art, taking two courses
outside the Classical World syllabus in her first and second years, and also to
cultivate interests in archaeology and history.

interdisciplinary workshop to be held on the afternoon of 21st February 2018 at UCL on the topic of ‘Rejecting the

				    Department of Greek & Latin
Greek and Latin can be studied in combination with other subjects.  Time is usually split equally between each department.  You can start Greek from scratch for this degree or carry on from your previous studies. Students taking a joint degree with Greek will need to take a minimum of 1 unit of Greek language per year, core courses in their 1st year (CLAS1205 Interpreting Greek Literature) and 2nd year (CLAS2115 Classics and Literary Theory) and the remaining 0.5 unit can be chosen from any of our courses, including courses on Classical Philosophy.An A Level 'A' (or 
equivalent) in Ancient Greek is required. Students

				    Department of Greek & Latin
Who can help me?Your administrators are: Stephanie Dutton is the BA Administrator and your first port of call and Robbie Macaulay is the interim MA administrator and Departmental Manager. Stephanie is based in the Departmental Office (Room
G05, ground floor, Gordon House) which is where the staff pigeon-holes are also
located. The Departmental Office is open from 10 am - 1 pm and from 2 -
5 pm on Mondays to Fridays. Robbie is based in Room G03 and his office is open for enquiries every weekday from 9 - 10 am and 1 - 2pm.Every student has a Personal Tutor,
whom they meet several times each year. In addition, Dr Fiachra Mac Góráin is
Departmental Tutor in Term 1 and Term 3 and Professor Miriam Leonard is Departmental Tutor in Term 2. They focus on helping Classics and Joint Honours students,
and Dr Peter Agócs, as Ancient World Tutor, gives help and support
to Ancient World students. In addition, all staff hold two office hours every
week, when you can see them without an appointment. The Undergraduate page lists all available Greek and Latin modules (see 'Courses planned for 2017-18'). Modules
beginning CLAS- indicate courses in English translation, those beginning GREK-
indicate courses in Ancient Greek and LATN- modules indicate courses in Latin.
Please note that some modules run in alternate years, e.g. CLAS7106
Greek Tragedy with CLAS7107 Greek Comedy; CLAS7204 Stoics,
Epicureans and Sceptics with CLAS7105 Early Greek Philosophy. Language
courses and compulsory modules run every year. Courses which start with the
numerical code 1XXX are available to 1st-year students only, with
the exception of beginners language modules which are available to some
second-year students. Courses that start with the numerical code 7XXX are
available to both second- and third-year students. Courses that start with the
numerical code 3XXX are available to finalists only. If you wish to take
modules outside those listed on our website, you should consult your Personal Tutor. The female toilets are on the 1st
floor and the male toilets are in the basement. There is an accessible toilet on the
ground floor. Please
complete your module registration via Portico – please read the Student User
Guide first. You will be asked to complete an Opinio survey of your module choices, which will open in late August. This is so we can check you have chosen modules appropriate to your degree and year of study. You need to take four units per year, ideally spread over
both teaching terms.Moodle is the e-learning environment used by UCL for lecturers to make information and lecture resources available to students. All modules
have their own Moodle pages. This is also where you will submit coursework via
Turnitin. Once your modules are confirmed on Portico, you will be automatically enrolled on the Moodle pages for those modules. If for some reason you are not enrolled on the Moodle pages for any of your confirmed modules, you will need to self-register as a
student, using your UCL email address, on the relevant Moodle webpage. You will
not be able to submit coursework via Turnitin if you do not do this. Please consult the Student
Moodle guide. If you have any problems with Moodle, please email Stephanie Dutton.  Almost all the
information you need is in our Undergraduate Handbook. For the quick link to your attendance registers, please go to https://ams.classics.ucl.ac.uk/student/.   You
will not be awarded an Honours degree, if you do not complete any of your
modules. A
minimum total of 12 units must be completed and 11 units must be passed in
order to obtain an ‘Honours’ degree. In order to ‘complete’ a unit, you must have completed
all parts of the assessment, i.e. you must submit all coursework and sit
all the exams. Furthermore, you must have a reasonable attempt at all parts of
the assessment. To be clear: you do not have to pass a unit to complete it, but
you do need to have made a realistic attempt to write the essay or answer the
questions on the exam paper. Yes, we offer a range of one-off study skills
sessions and strongly encourage students to attend. We will email you to notify you about dates,
times and content of sessions. In addition, the
Language Surgery offers students an opportunity to raise any language issues
with Dr Antony Makrinos. It is held on
Tuesdays (time TBC) in term time in Room G01, ground floor, Gordon House. As you can maximise your exam marks by good
exam technique, we also offer a session on Exam Technique.   The Department takes careers guidance very
seriously and encourages students from the first year of their degree programme
to take advantage of advice from the UCL Careers Service and opportunities for work
experience and internship. Dr Antony Makrinos is the Department’s Careers
Liaison Officer and Robert Donovan is our contact within the UCL Careers
Service. The Department has a Careers dedicated webpage and holds a range of one-off Careers sessions in
terms 1 and 2, including a Careers Forum in November, which involves Departmental alumni talking about
their careers. The series Alumnus/Alumna of the Month also provides an
insight into the different career paths you might choose when your studies end.  Course tutors will return essays to you with the marks
and comments of the first marker four weeks after the coursework submission
date during term-time. (Please note that these marks are provisional and depend
upon second marker and external examiner scrutiny.) The module lecturer will email you
when they are ready to collect from the table outside the Departmental Office. This
is produced by the UCL Registry usually at the end of March each year. You will
receive your own personal exam timetable. Yes,
please note that the first week of the summer term is revision week. Every
module, for which an exam forms part of the assessment, offers a one-hour
revision class. These are held for the whole of the
month of May. Students need to be present at all times – when you are not
taking exams, you need to be revising! Please
note that you will be barred from taking UCL exams if you have any debt on your
record, including Library fines. Marks
cannot be released until after the BA Exam Board, which is usually held in
mid-June every year. You will be sent an email to let you know exactly when you
will receive your results by email. Graduation
ceremonies are arranged centrally by the UCL Registry.  Their email address is: grad_ceremonies@ucl.ac.uk. Yes
– the Department of Greek and Latin has an
Undergraduate and a Postgraduate Common Room. The Undergraduate Common Room is
Room G10 on the ground floor of Gordon House. This is where your pigeon-holes
are located – please check them regularly for correspondence. There are
computers you can use at the back of the room. Please inform Stephanie if any of
the computers (or indeed anything else) is not working and she will arrange for
them to be repaired. Information
Services do not enable us to provide these facilities. However, printing
facilities are offered in the UCL Library and in UCL cluster rooms, of which
there are many. The nearest is in the Institute of Archaeology next door (31-34
Gordon Square).  You need to obtain a UCL photo ID
and carry it with you all times. You may be asked to show it to a UCL Security
Officer. Please take some
form of identity (e.g. credit/debit card, passport) to Security Systems,
ground floor, Andrew Huxley building.  You
can then take your photo ID to the UCL Library,
and they can adapt it to act as your UCL Library card.  Yes
- the Department will always email you, using your UCL email address. It is a
UCL requirement that students check their UCL email in-box regularly. The
UCL on-line directory is the quickest way of finding staff and student email
addresses.
You
can telephone, email or visit the Information Services Helpdesk.  You can also connect to Eduroam, UCL’s Wifi service.  Please consult the Student Guide.
  Unfortunately,
no – the kitchen is too small to allow undergraduate students to use it. However,
there are many cafes and eating places at UCL and in the UCL Union. We would
be delighted if you did. The Greek Play is performed in translation in February
every year, usually in UCL’s own theatre, The Bloomsbury. Invitations for
productions are invited and students vote for their favourite nomination every
June, and then details are circulated. Apart
from acting roles, there are lots of opportunities to get involved backstage
too. Dr Tom Mackenzie is the academic mentor for the Greek play. The cupboard in the Undergraduate
Common Room is for props.
You
are encouraged to attend as many lectures and events as possible, not only in
the Department but throughout UCL. Please see the Department’s list of lectures
and public events. 
  Yes,
you can apply
for the annual Stephen Instone Undergraduate Travel Fund, which awards bursaries to current undergraduates for travel to
ancient sites in the Mediterranean. We
are committed to doing our best for the environment. Please don’t waste paper
and print and copy double-sided, wherever possible. Please save energy by
switching off lights, computers and heaters when you leave a room or stop using
a computer. The Department is taking part in Green Impact, which is a programme to initiate Green change, and is currently working towards a Silver award. We have a noticeboard dedicated to Environmental Sustainability on the ground floor opposite the accessible toilet which is updated regularly.The Department's Green Champions are:Stephanie Dutton Robbie MacaulayProfessor Gesine Manuwald Please contact Stephanie Dutton if you are interested in becoming a Green Champion for the Department.More information about Green Impact is available here. The
Department of Greek and Latin was given a bronze award in the 2014 Gender
Equality Charter Mark trial. UCL has a policy of
zero tolerance towards sexual harassment. The Department is currently applying to renew its Athena Swan Bronze Award from September 2017. Stephanie Dutton is the Departmental Equal
Opportunities Liaison Officer. If you have any questions, or you think you have been a victim of sexual harrassment or discrimination, please contact Stephanie in the first instance. 
 Then, depending upon your enquiry, please email Stephanie or Robbie.

(Classics Q800, Classics with Year Abroad Q801) is focused on the study of Latin and Greek language and literature, and require students to have an A-level or equivalent in one or both ancient languages. Every year, half your study must involve courses in Latin and Greek, though there is a considerable amount of flexibility as regards the other half.(Ancient World Studies Q805, Ancient World Studies with Study Abroad Q806) are our most flexible degree programmes, providing students with an almost entirely free choice of courses covering classical literature, history and archaeology. Students are not required to have studied Latin or Greek.These combine study of either Latin or Greek with other areas of study.  Latin is available as part of the Modern Language Plus degree (and can be combined with languages such as French and Spanish). Greek is available as part of the Philosophy with Greek degree.  For these courses students typically take half of their courses with us and the other half with their home department

Who can help me?Your administrators are: Stephanie Dutton is the BA Administrator and your first port of call and Robbie Macaulay is the interim MA administrator and Departmental Manager. Stephanie is based in the Departmental Office (Room
G05, ground floor, Gordon House) which is where the staff pigeon-holes are also
located. The Departmental Office is open from 10 am - 1 pm and from 2 -
5 pm on Mondays to Fridays. Robbie is based in Room G03 and his office is open for enquiries every weekday from 9 - 10 am and 1 - 2pm.Every student has a Personal Tutor,
whom they meet several times each year. In addition, Dr Fiachra Mac Góráin is
Departmental Tutor in Term 1 and Term 3 and Professor Miriam Leonard is Departmental Tutor in Term 2. They focus on helping Classics and Joint Honours students,
and Dr Peter Agócs, as Ancient World Tutor, gives help and support
to Ancient World students. In addition, all staff hold two office hours every
week, when you can see them without an appointment. The Undergraduate page lists all available Greek and Latin modules (see 'Courses planned for 2017-18'). Modules
beginning CLAS- indicate courses in English translation, those beginning GREK-
indicate courses in Ancient Greek and LATN- modules indicate courses in Latin.
Please note that some modules run in alternate years, e.g. CLAS7106
Greek Tragedy with CLAS7107 Greek Comedy; CLAS7204 Stoics,
Epicureans and Sceptics with CLAS7105 Early Greek Philosophy. Language
courses and compulsory modules run every year. Courses which start with the
numerical code 1XXX are available to 1st-year students only, with
the exception of beginners language modules which are available to some
second-year students. Courses that start with the numerical code 7XXX are
available to both second- and third-year students. Courses that start with the
numerical code 3XXX are available to finalists only. If you wish to take
modules outside those listed on our website, you should consult your Personal Tutor. The female toilets are on the 1st
floor and the male toilets are in the basement. There is an accessible toilet on the
ground floor. Please
complete your module registration via Portico – please read the Student User
Guide first. You will be asked to complete an Opinio survey of your module choices, which will open in late August. This is so we can check you have chosen modules appropriate to your degree and year of study. You need to take four units per year, ideally spread over
both teaching terms.Moodle is the e-learning environment used by UCL for lecturers to make information and lecture resources available to students. All modules
have their own Moodle pages. This is also where you will submit coursework via
Turnitin. Once your modules are confirmed on Portico, you will be automatically enrolled on the Moodle pages for those modules. If for some reason you are not enrolled on the Moodle pages for any of your confirmed modules, you will need to self-register as a
student, using your UCL email address, on the relevant Moodle webpage. You will
not be able to submit coursework via Turnitin if you do not do this. Please consult the Student
Moodle guide. If you have any problems with Moodle, please email Stephanie Dutton.  Almost all the
information you need is in our Undergraduate Handbook. For the quick link to your attendance registers, please go to https://ams.classics.ucl.ac.uk/student/.   You
will not be awarded an Honours degree, if you do not complete any of your
modules. A
minimum total of 12 units must be completed and 11 units must be passed in
order to obtain an ‘Honours’ degree. In order to ‘complete’ a unit, you must have completed
all parts of the assessment, i.e. you must submit all coursework and sit
all the exams. Furthermore, you must have a reasonable attempt at all parts of
the assessment. To be clear: you do not have to pass a unit to complete it, but
you do need to have made a realistic attempt to write the essay or answer the
questions on the exam paper. Yes, we offer a range of one-off study skills
sessions and strongly encourage students to attend. We will email you to notify you about dates,
times and content of sessions. In addition, the
Language Surgery offers students an opportunity to raise any language issues
with Dr Antony Makrinos. It is held on
Tuesdays (time TBC) in term time in Room G01, ground floor, Gordon House. As you can maximise your exam marks by good
exam technique, we also offer a session on Exam Technique.   The Department takes careers guidance very
seriously and encourages students from the first year of their degree programme
to take advantage of advice from the UCL Careers Service and opportunities for work
experience and internship. Dr Antony Makrinos is the Department’s Careers
Liaison Officer and Robert Donovan is our contact within the UCL Careers
Service. The Department has a Careers dedicated webpage and holds a range of one-off Careers sessions in
terms 1 and 2, including a Careers Forum in November, which involves Departmental alumni talking about
their careers. The series Alumnus/Alumna of the Month also provides an
insight into the different career paths you might choose when your studies end.  Course tutors will return essays to you with the marks
and comments of the first marker four weeks after the coursework submission
date during term-time. (Please note that these marks are provisional and depend
upon second marker and external examiner scrutiny.) The module lecturer will email you
when they are ready to collect from the table outside the Departmental Office. This
is produced by the UCL Registry usually at the end of March each year. You will
receive your own personal exam timetable. Yes,
please note that the first week of the summer term is revision week. Every
module, for which an exam forms part of the assessment, offers a one-hour
revision class. These are held for the whole of the
month of May. Students need to be present at all times – when you are not
taking exams, you need to be revising! Please
note that you will be barred from taking UCL exams if you have any debt on your
record, including Library fines. Marks
cannot be released until after the BA Exam Board, which is usually held in
mid-June every year. You will be sent an email to let you know exactly when you
will receive your results by email. Graduation
ceremonies are arranged centrally by the UCL Registry.  Their email address is: grad_ceremonies@ucl.ac.uk. Yes
– the Department of Greek and Latin has an
Undergraduate and a Postgraduate Common Room. The Undergraduate Common Room is
Room G10 on the ground floor of Gordon House. This is where your pigeon-holes
are located – please check them regularly for correspondence. There are
computers you can use at the back of the room. Please inform Stephanie if any of
the computers (or indeed anything else) is not working and she will arrange for
them to be repaired. Information
Services do not enable us to provide these facilities. However, printing
facilities are offered in the UCL Library and in UCL cluster rooms, of which
there are many. The nearest is in the Institute of Archaeology next door (31-34
Gordon Square).  You need to obtain a UCL photo ID
and carry it with you all times. You may be asked to show it to a UCL Security
Officer. Please take some
form of identity (e.g. credit/debit card, passport) to Security Systems,
ground floor, Andrew Huxley building.  You
can then take your photo ID to the UCL Library,
and they can adapt it to act as your UCL Library card.  Yes
- the Department will always email you, using your UCL email address. It is a
UCL requirement that students check their UCL email in-box regularly. The
UCL on-line directory is the quickest way of finding staff and student email
addresses.
You
can telephone, email or visit the Information Services Helpdesk.  You can also connect to Eduroam, UCL’s Wifi service.  Please consult the Student Guide.
  Unfortunately,
no – the kitchen is too small to allow undergraduate students to use it. However,
there are many cafes and eating places at UCL and in the UCL Union. We would
be delighted if you did. The Greek Play is performed in translation in February
every year, usually in UCL’s own theatre, The Bloomsbury. Invitations for
productions are invited and students vote for their favourite nomination every

In a special session of the Roman
Epic (CLAS7109) course on 6 February 2015, the students observed a live performance
of the contest between two principal characters from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, impersonated by the
course instructors—the goddess Athena (Antony Makrinos) and her insubordinate
apprentice Arachne (Emily Lord-Kambitsch).Dr. Makrinos produced an
arrangement of A.D. Melville’s 2008 translation of the Ovid passage in order to
create a stronger impression of a dialogue between Athena and Arachne during
the weaving of their respective stories on the loom. These stories were
represented for the class in the form of a PowerPoint presentation featuring
paintings of the scenes woven in Ovid’s poem.  Athena addresses Arachne’s insubordinationThe Weaving contest The performance was followed by a
close reading of the text, accompanied by the construction of a spidergram on
the board representing various themes the course instructors and students
highlighted in the course of the discussion (including transformation, artist
as the epic heroine, the cultural function of art, the significance of weaving,
and the definition of immortality). By employing this performance and incorporating
the subsequent discussion, the teachers aimed to explore the impact of this
method as a ‘living spidergram’, an immersive, performative, and experiential
means of exploring connections between the greater themes of the course (such
as the relationship between gods and mortals in epic poetry, the voice of the
individual poet within the epic tradition) through an interactive engagement
with a specific text.The students’ impressions of this
session provide an initial understanding of the benefits of this type of
teaching and the opportunities it offers undergraduates to encounter and interpret
a text, and its role within the course in a new way. ‘I think the class worked really well. Firstly, you have the
surprising element of an unexpected performance which is surely very memorable
to the class. Secondly, I liked the idea of the web on the board as it is
related to the overall topic of spider/weaving/writing poetry as weaving
(deducere carmen) and the supportive images you presented on Powerpoint...That
creates a coherent theme that runs through the lesson.’‘I thought it was great that you both wanted to surprise us and
using different teaching methods (at least in my opinion) is a great way to
keep us on our toes!’‘I probably will
never forget the performance, which will help me when I have to prepare for my
final exams. It was a graphic way to explain the myth of Arachne and to
remember with more detail the characteristics of Ovid and the Metamorphoses.’ ‘Through the representation we could talk during the
remaining lesson about the story, drawing different ideas and its main themes,
so, after having not just read, but visualized, it was easier for us.’ Students also delivered some helpful feedback for improvement and
future directions for this teaching approach that will emphasise the connection
between the performance and the discussion.‘I
think it is important that the sheet and the web on the board are well
coordinated with each other. Perhaps you could ask the students after the
performance what they found conspicuous/what became evident in acting and not
in a mere reading of the text. This could then lead the way to a discussion of
the text's structure/characters/points on the notesheet.’Athena versus ArachneAntony Makrinos and Emily
Lord-Kambitsch will present a paper at the CALT Learning and Teaching
Conference, Monday 13 April, entitled ‘Athena versus Arachne: Experiential
Learning, and Teaching through Performance’. This paper will look at the case
study of this session in order to discuss the use of performance in the
classroom to create an experiential learning environment for students to engage
with a curriculum in a holistic way, with consideration for the greater aims of
the course.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
 28-29 June 2017 in the Department of Greek
and Latin, Teaching Fellow Emily Chow-Kambitsch and undergraduate Greek and
Latin students Hansy Shore, Abhilash Sivaraman, and Caterina Domeneghini ran
UCL’s first Living Latin Workshop. This workshop was generously supported by
UCL ChangeMakers and UCL Greek and Latin, and offered participants an
exploration of various pedagogical methods for approaching Latin as a living
language. 
This project aimed to provide a foundation
for Latin students and enthusiasts across disciplines to cultivate a new mode
of connection with their curriculum: an active engagement with Latin language
that can foster development of linguistic skills, and can allow for a more
nuanced understanding of the language’s relationship to aspects of ancient
Roman cultural identity. The workshop encouraged students to bridge study of
ancient cultures with contemporary cultural experience by communicating their
own ideas in Latin, which is usually taught through comparatively passive
absorption of set texts for translation into English. The workshop attracted 20 participants from
a variety of backgrounds: academics, students, schoolteachers, and several
retirees who had come back to studies in Latin very recently. Motivations for
attending the workshop cited on our feedback questionnaire included: ‘To
improve my level of Latin, and engage more with the language’; ‘To see if
“Living Latin” can provide more exciting ways of teaching Latin’; and ‘I think
it is very important to promote active fluency in Latin in order to improve the
standards of language knowledge across the board (students & teachers)’. It
was a great benefit for us to welcome such a diverse audience, as it allowed us
to have rich discussions about conventional Latin teaching methods, and the
potential for the growth of immersive initiatives in formal and informal
pedagogical settings.  This two-day immersive workshop combined
elements of Latin composition and conversation, and discussion in English:
evaluating immersive Latin currently used in teaching and research; writing
dialogues on varied themes; applying Latin speaking skills to cooperative
games; and discussing short passages of Latin literature in Latin. Participants
were thus provided with a foundational set of immersive methods for enhancing
their grammar and translation skills and enriching their insight into the Roman
cultural perspective. Our Latinists hard at work!Before we introduced our series of
activities in using Latin as a living
language, we emphasized that our main objective was not to achieve perfect pronunciation, perfect grammatical
constructions, or perfect precision in vocabulary usage. Rather, our goal was
to experiment with generating our own ideas and utterances in Latin, and to
discuss the pedagogical tools that best aid this process. Indeed, throughout
the course of the workshop, participants were eager to speak to the benefits,
challenges, and ethics (is it cultural misappropriation? Should we use
neologisms and otherwise attempt to discuss modern inventions, cultural
phenomena in Latin?) embodied in the active use of Latin today.The workshop began with the organizers introducing
the current state of play and exciting new developments in Living Latin
initiatives worldwide. We provided participants with an informational handout
on current Latin speaking schools, podcasts, and workshops taking place around
the world, and gave some web demonstrations of particularly interesting
examples, such as the Quomodo Dicitur?
Podcast, whose hosts discuss a range of subjects in academia, current
events, and popular culture entirely in Latin! Emily
and Abhilash discussing current Living Latin activities and organisations The exercises progressed from pronunciation
and recitation exercises to short oral conversation and written composition
activities, in order to encourage participants to explore incrementally their
skills in active use of Latin. Here is a sampling of some of the activities:Conversation time: the "stations exercise"
‘Dining out’ exercise from
conversation stations: participants role-play ordering ancient Roman dishes!We were very fortunate to have two guest
speakers join us throughout the course of the workshop.Dr. Pauline Souleau, a lecturer in French
at the University of Oxford, spoke to us about the challenges of teaching
conversation in modern language, and shared the importance of structuring a
language course that prioritizes speaking and listening skills for the sake of
understanding the consequential transformations of grammar and vocabulary from
the written to the oral form of a language. Dr. Souleau’s lecture initiated a
lively discussion that addressed questions of conventional methods in Latin
language teaching, and distinctions between the register of Latin we are used
to seeing in classical literature versus the register we should aim for when
speaking Latin. The conversation expanded to encompass the broader aims of
Latin pedagogy: should we treat Latin sentences as codes to be broken? To what
extent can the structure of the language itself provide insight into the
culture? To what extent can and should active use of the language be perceived
as a benefit to understanding the Ancient Roman world?A. Gratius
Avitus, a fluent Latin speaker and founder of the Circulus Latinus Londiniensis
(London Latin Circle), addressed the participants for one hour in Latin, introducing them to a range of
resources, organizations and events which teach and explore uses of Latin as a
living language. Videos of Living Latin communities in action demonstrated
remarkable variation in individual speaking styles (accents, pronunciation,
inflection, and idiosyncracies in vocabulary), and exhibited each speaker’s
unique ability to bring the language to life. Avitus’ talk was eye-opening for
participants, some of whom were astonished at the amount of content they could
readily understand, even if it had been years or decades since they had
encountered formal instruction in Latin. Avitus also led
a highly stimulating short literary seminar, where participants read and
discussed (in Latin) the opening of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Vita Merlini (style, themes, and noteworthy areas of engagement
with textual precedents in classical Latin, especially in the epic tradition).
Avitus was an excellent facilitator, encouraging participants to offer
responses to his questions in as much depth and completeness as they were
comfortable providing. This activity showed particular potential for further
development either in extended sessions in further workshops, or in a regularly
meeting Latin conversation group setting, ideally with the facilitation of an
experienced Latin speaker.

Avitus explaining a literary
passage entirely in Latin!We were very impressed by the level of
fluency the participants gained over the course of two days. The transformation
between the participants’ rather hesitant introductions on Day One and the much
more confident full sentences generated during the game of ‘Versipellis’ on Day
Two was wonderful to witness.We benefited significantly from having an
experienced Latin speaker present throughout the workshop. Avitus’ help,
patience, guidance, and mentorship were a great part of what made the day a
success, and participant feedback suggests that this was an important factor in
aiding their confidence in developing written and oral composition skills.The activities were generally
well-structured so that people with various levels of Latin proficiency could
participate equally, and could challenge themselves in accordance with their
experience and comfort levels.The workshop received overwhelmingly
positive feedback, with half of the 14 respondents writing on their feedback
forms that they are ‘very likely’ to continue exploring immersive methods, and
9 participants designating that they ‘strongly agree’ with the statement that
immersive methods are of use to Latin pedagogy.Many participants described the ways in
which their ideas about ‘Living Latin’ had changed as a result of attending the
workshop: We hope that following the success of this
workshop at UCL Greek and Latin we can run similar workshops, a Latin
conversation group, or other related activities in Living Latin at UCL, and
perhaps in collaboration with existing Living Latin initiatives in the UK and
further afield. We have witnessed in a very short period of time the great
potential for the pedagogical methods in the active use of Latin to raise
students’ confidence, enthusiasm, and proficiency in language skills. When
students are invited to approach Latin on their own terms, they have a personal
stake in mastering grammar concepts and acquiring vocabulary, and when they
engage in dialogue on ancient literature in the original language, they carve
new interpretative channels that might reflect a greater sensitivity to the
cultural perspective found in the language itself.We thank UCL ChangeMakers and UCL Greek and
Latin for helping to make this event a wonderful success, and we look forward
to seeing its legacy grow and flourish!Note: Watch this page for videos of the
workshop to be added!

Antony Makrinos and PhD student Kyriaki Ioannidou staged a special reading of Amphitruo, Plautus' classic tragi-comedy of love and deceit.This staged class was part of an idea to introduce innovative ways of teaching Latin (and specifically Roman Comedy) to undergraduate students of the Greek and Latin Department, UCL. The course was Latin Texts 2, Plautus: Amphitruo (LATN 3008/3008A). The aims of the class were to live the experience of teaching Latin as an educator-performer and to explore the educational benefits of this experience and its reception by the students.The class included a live performance of the last scene of Plautus' play Amphitruo by the teacher and a PhD student with the use of masks and a discussion of the practices used. The text was adapted to suit the needs of the class. Both the text and the lecture notes can be found below:The masks for Jupiter and Alcumena.Alcumena's husband AmphitruoAntony’s and Kyriaki’s thoughts about the class will be presented in the Arts and Humanities conference 2013 Storyville: Exploring narratives of learning and teaching, organised by the Higher Education Academy, (Brighton, 29-30 May 2013). A shared talk will be presented with the title: “Teaching Latin: teaching experience as part of theatrical performance”. Details >>The talk will introduce innovative pedagogies and methodologies for the teaching of ancient languages used in the Department of Greek and Latin, UCL. The session will invite dialogue between the delegates about the creative teaching of languages through staged classes, and it is hoped that this will stimulate interest in this way of teaching. Particular emphasis will be given to methodologies which enhance the teaching experience and help students digest aspects of the language. Interest is anticipated from teachers in the Humanities willing to use original techniques to make teaching engaging. Delegates will experience the class second hand (through videos) and will have hands on the props.Many thanks to:- Viv Sendall (Visiting Tutor in Scenic Art) for working so hard with the masks and for providing advice on how to use them; Andy Stead (Senior Lecturer), Gussie Dennet, Lydia Duncombe and Bianca Paule, (second year students on the Creative Arts for Theatre and Film course) UCA Rochester for producing the wonderful masks;- Kyriaki Ioannidou for her patience and her enthusiasm for the staged class and of course for her stunning performance as Bromi-Amphitruo;- Matthew Milner for his wonderful sound effects with the thunderbolts;- and Anastasia Papamichael for recording the class.

7-9 February 2018 at the Shaw Theatre, London NW1 2AJTickets not yet on sale.The UCL Classical Drama Society and the Department of Greek and Latin each year present a classical play in English translation in UCL's own theatre, the UCL Bloomsbury. The play takes place in February each year (about the same time as the ancient Athenian dramatic festival known as the Lenaia). This is now one of the most famous and long-running commitments to the modern production of ancient drama in the world. It attracts large audiences, many of whom are young people studying classical drama at school or university, and is regularly reviewed in the national press. Ticket prices are kept low. The production is managed by students in the Department of Greek and Latin, with help and advice from staff. A number of former students involved in the classical play have gone on to careers in drama. Students choose a director and a producer in the autumn: the title of the play for the following year is announced in late October (and will be posted on this website).The Department of Greek and Latin is committed to bringing these productions to the widest possible audience. For each production we run a programme of lectures and workshops, free and open to the public, which are run by leading academics and theatre experts from across the UK. For the benefit of schools and colleges we also create a web-page of study materials on ancient drama in general, and with special focus on the current year's performance. The students also maintain a blog on the play as they rehearse.

In a special session of the Roman
Epic (CLAS7109) course on 6 February 2015, the students observed a live performance
of the contest between two principal characters from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, impersonated by the
course instructors—the goddess Athena (Antony Makrinos) and her insubordinate
apprentice Arachne (Emily Lord-Kambitsch).Dr. Makrinos produced an
arrangement of A.D. Melville’s 2008 translation of the Ovid passage in order to
create a stronger impression of a dialogue between Athena and Arachne during
the weaving of their respective stories on the loom. These stories were
represented for the class in the form of a PowerPoint presentation featuring
paintings of the scenes woven in Ovid’s poem.  Athena addresses Arachne’s insubordinationThe Weaving contest The performance was followed by a
close reading of the text, accompanied by the construction of a spidergram on
the board representing various themes the course instructors and students
highlighted in the course of the discussion (including transformation, artist
as the epic heroine, the cultural function of art, the significance of weaving,
and the definition of immortality). By employing this performance and incorporating
the subsequent discussion, the teachers aimed to explore the impact of this
method as a ‘living spidergram’, an immersive, performative, and experiential
means of exploring connections between the greater themes of the course (such
as the relationship between gods and mortals in epic poetry, the voice of the
individual poet within the epic tradition) through an interactive engagement
with a specific text.The students’ impressions of this
session provide an initial understanding of the benefits of this type of
teaching and the opportunities it offers undergraduates to encounter and interpret
a text, and its role within the course in a new way. ‘I think the class worked really well. Firstly, you have the
surprising element of an unexpected performance which is surely very memorable
to the class. Secondly, I liked the idea of the web on the board as it is
related to the overall topic of spider/weaving/writing poetry as weaving
(deducere carmen) and the supportive images you presented on Powerpoint...That
creates a coherent theme that runs through the lesson.’‘I thought it was great that you both wanted to surprise us and
using different teaching methods (at least in my opinion) is a great way to
keep us on our toes!’‘I probably will
never forget the performance, which will help me when I have to prepare for my
final exams. It was a graphic way to explain the myth of Arachne and to
remember with more detail the characteristics of Ovid and the Metamorphoses.’ ‘Through the representation we could talk during the
remaining lesson about the story, drawing different ideas and its main themes,
so, after having not just read, but visualized, it was easier for us.’ Students also delivered some helpful feedback for improvement and
future directions for this teaching approach that will emphasise the connection
between the performance and the discussion.‘I
think it is important that the sheet and the web on the board are well
coordinated with each other. Perhaps you could ask the students after the
performance what they found conspicuous/what became evident in acting and not
in a mere reading of the text. This could then lead the way to a discussion of
the text's structure/characters/points on the notesheet.’Athena versus ArachneAntony Makrinos and Emily
Lord-Kambitsch will present a paper at the CALT Learning and Teaching
Conference, Monday 13 April, entitled ‘Athena versus Arachne: Experiential
Learning, and Teaching through Performance’. This paper will look at the case
study of this session in order to discuss the use of performance in the
classroom to create an experiential learning environment for students to engage
with a curriculum in a holistic way, with consideration for the greater aims of
the course.

Antony Makrinos with the help of PhD students Danae Bafa and Tzu-I Liao presented a special class for Greek for Beginners in the Petrie Museum. This class was part of an idea to introduce innovative ways of teaching Greek to undergraduate students of the Greek and Latin Department, UCL for the course Greek for Beginners A, term 1 (GREK1001).The aims of the class were to engage and motivate students in their learning of Greek and communicate the idea that students from the Beginners class are able to understand the general meaning of short passages or inscriptions in Greek. The purpose of the class was to explore the benefits of an educational experience in which students come into contact with material culture which challenges the perception of Greek as a “dead language”.The class included the presentation of 10 ancient objects by the tutor with the collaboration of a curator from the museum and a PhD student and a discussion with the students about the identification of the objects and the translation of Greek inscriptions on them with the help of the grammar and syntax learnt during the course.A list of the objects presented can be found below:1. 58267            ring                  IC XC ΑΓΕ2. 59254           Dice                  Numbers3. 59255           Dice                  Numbers4. 59434           Mummy label     ΩΡΟΣ ΕΤΩΝ Δ5. 59498           stamp seal         BACΙΛΕ6. 32088           ostracon            Letters exercise7. 45647           mummy label     Pangarsis son of Kolanthos who lived 60 years8. 45639           mummy label     Sisois son of old Sisois his mother…9.a.

The project culminates in a dissertation of 12,000 words (60 credits). The project must display advanced knowledge of at least one of the classical languages.The programme is taught in small seminars or classes, rarely exceeding twelve participants. Students are expected to prepare for class each week, typically by reading preparatory material and texts in the original Greek or Latin. Student performance is assessed through coursework essays, unseen examination, and the dissertation.Several funding options may be possible for applicants to this programme, including: UCL Scholarships for UK/EU & Overseas Students, Arts & Humanities Faculty Awards, and Greek & Latin departmental awards.For a comprehensive list of the funding opportunities available at UCL, including funding relevant to your nationality, please visit the Scholarships and Funding website.The MA is an ideal springboard for a PhD programme, and students will find unique opportunities to acquire skills in the handling of documentary evidence particularly valuable for further research. Some students go on to pursue research at UCL or other institutions. Others have developed their skills in order to enter careers in e.g. teaching, publishing, the media, cultural heritage or the legal, business, charitable or financial sectors.The MA in Classics offers a wide range of skills highly valued by employers, such as advanced oral communication; the ability to abstract and synthesise information, and to construct and manage arguments; independent and critical thinking on difficult issues; IT skills (including the ability to access and evaluate electronic data); and good time management, organisational, and planning skills.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
γηράσκω δ᾽ αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενοςExplore the rich heritage of Greece and Rome at one of the finest departments for the study of the ancient world, rated highly for its teaching and consistently outstanding in its research.Life Learning is a chance for you to follow one or two of our courses without enrolling as a student. The Department of Greek and Latin at UCL has an unrivalled range of courses, some taught in the original languages, some taught in translation. Most of these courses are available outside our degree programmes for those wishing to study for personal development or intellectual pleasure. The Department regularly admits Life Learning students, provided that they have the appropriate pre-requisite for the course(s) in which they are interested. (We also have to make sure that there is space on particular courses for existing students within the Department, but this does not usually present problems.) LL students come from a wide variety of backgrounds: retired people, mature students wishing to prepare for full-time education in the future, general enthusiasts, former students from the Department who wish to keep their experience of the Classical World alive, and teachers wishing to broaden their repertoire have all applied to us in the past. Courses run by the Department are scheduled at fixed times, which cannot be changed. Classes are timetabled between 9am and 6pm (see the Departmental course-list for further details). LL students participate in and contribute to courses in the same way as UCL students. However, LL is not formally accredited and students are not entitled to take the formal exam at the end of the year, although we have in the past allowed LL students to sit an exam informally within the department if they wish to. Once they have been admitted to the Department, LL students are entitled to have access to the UCL library with reference rights only.  If they wish to have borrowing rights, they need to request this from the Department who will arrange it with the UCL Library.  There is an extra fee of £150 for Library borrowing rights.  All cheques should be made payable to "University College London". If you would like to undertake a course as a LL student (full course list below), please complete an enrolment form and return by post or by email.  The deadline for receipt of completed forms for enrolment on courses for 2017/18 for term one is Monday 18 September 2017, and Monday 4 December 2017 for term two.If you have any further questions, please contact Stephanie Dutton for BA modules, or Robbie Macaulay for MA modules.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
 There are many excellent institutions at which you can 
study the Classical world - and they are all very different. Each 
institution has its own particular atmosphere and teaching style, and 
offers a particular range of courses. Some will be better suited to your
 own interests and personality than others, so it is a good idea to find
 out as much as you can about the institutions and programmes to which 
you are considering making an application. On this page, you will find links to some primary sources 
of information about the study of the Classical world at UCL, such as 
the Classical World prospectus and the general UCL prospectus,
 but you will also find some more particular information about the 
admissions process for our programmes. If you can't find the information
 you are looking for, or if you have any questions at all, please don't 
hesitate to contact the Undergraduate Admissions Tutor, Dr Fiachra Mac Góráin. UCL Greek and Latin is one of the top-rated Classics 
departments in one of the top-rated universities in the UK, and indeed, 
in the world. Within the department are specialists in the fields of 
literature, philosophy, historiography, linguistics and papyrology, and 
the department's expertise ranges from the earliest beginnings of the 
Classical world to its influence on the art and thought of the present 
day. Our two core BA programmes are The Ancient World programme requires no previous knowledge of Greek or Latin. The Classics with Study Abroad and Ancient World with a Year Abroad programmes offer students the opportunity to spend their third year (of four) studying their subject abroad.  UCL also offers BA programmes in Ancient History and Ancient History and Egyptology run by the Department of History; and a BA in Classical Archaeology run by the UCL Institute of Archaeology. The Department is located close to some of the finest 
resources for the study of the Classical world in Britain: not only does
 UCL have an excellent classics library, but the British Museum, the British Library, Institute of Classical Studies are only a few minutes' walk away. When you need a break from your studies, the University of London's Student Central
 and Fitness centre is just round the corner, and for shopping Tottenham
 Court Road and Oxford Street are in easy walking distance. The UCAS form and afterThe first stage
 of the admissions process is the completion and submission of your UCAS
 form. We will get in touch when your UCAS form arrives to let you know 
that we have received it. If you have included an email address on your 
UCAS form, then we will acknowledge receipt of your application with an 
email to that address. Processing the formsOn the basis of 
these UCAS forms, we then decide to whom we would like to make offers. 
We judge every UCAS form on its own merits, and many factors go into 
this decision, but an enthusiastic personal statement, a good reference,
 good predictions and a strong set of exam results are certainly 
important. Although we try to process decisions as quickly as possible, 
sometimes we are not able to make immediate decisions. If you haven't 
heard from us, this means that we are still considering your 
application. We may have to contact you to request further information, 
so it really is important to check regularly the email address you 
supply on your UCAS form. Open DaysThose who receive offers will
 be invited to one of our departmental open days. In the academic year 2016-17 the open days will take place on 8 February 2017 and 26 
April 2017. The open day usually lasts about four hours (1:30 - 5:30 
pm) and includes talks from staff and students, lunch, sample lectures, 
and tours of UCL given by our current students. It is an excellent 
opportunity to get a feeling for what it would be like to study at UCL, 
and to ask questions. All our programmes are rigorous and broad-ranging degrees 
which qualify students for a remarkably wide variety of jobs. Career 
destinations in recent years have included: teaching, law, computing, 
accountancy, marketing, banking, music (classical and popular - let's 
not forget Chris Martin and Tim Rice-Oxley were both UCL Classicists!), 
acting, the media, business, the voluntary sector, local government, 
politics, and graduate study. The UCL Careers Service provides general 
guidance to students, and there are also a number of specific talks 
aimed at those studying the Classical world. There are a number of UCL open days throughout the year: check the UCL Open-days page for more details. The department also participates in the University of London Taster Courses. If you are very keen to visit the department or talk to 
someone about studying the Classical World at UCL, do get in touch with 
the Admissions Tutor, Dr Fiachra Mac Góráin. All members of the department are happy to give school talks. Feel free to get in touch.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
Visting or Affiliate students are students enrolled in a
university outside Britain who study for a year or a term at UCLThe Department of Greek and Latin every year welcomes
visiting students (undergraduate and postgraduate) from around the world. Affiliate students contribute to the distinct character of our Department. The department
has a wide range of courses both in Greek and Latin and in translation, all
available to such students.  Students from European countries usually apply through our
many Erasmus/Socrates links and are usually interested primarily in
courses in Classics. We currently have 
Erasmus agreements with universities in Cyprus (Nicosia), France (Paris IV; 
Strasbourg), Germany (Heidelberg), Greece (Thessaloniki), Hungary 
(EOTVOS, Budapest), Italy (Bologna; Parma; Siena), Spain (Salamanca; 
Valencia), and Switzerland (Geneva). Students from elsewhere in the
world may be Classics majors, but many enrol in individual courses out
of interest. For most of our courses in translation no prior experience
in the study of the Greek and Roman worlds is necessary, but we are
happy to advise. If you have any queries, please contact the the Affiliate Tutor for Greek & Latin, Dr Rosie Harman

				    Department of Greek & Latin
I don't have an A Level (or equivalent) in Greek or Latin -- can I still apply for BA Classics?Without an A Level (or equivalent) in Greek or Latin you cannot apply for the BA Classics.  The BA Ancient World does not require any Greek or Latin and offers the opportunity to start either or both of the languages over the course of the degree.  The courses are not identical, but most of the module options are open to both Classics and Ancient World students.What are the differences between the Classics and Ancient World degrees?The BA Classics has a strong focus on Greek AND Latin language.  Every year you will need to take a minimum of half of your courses in Greek and Latin (which you will need to pass).  You also have core courses in Interpreting Greek and Latin Literature in your first year and Classics and Literary Theory in your second yearThe BA Ancient World is a more interdisciplinary degree, straddling the departments of Greek and Latin (language and literature), History, and Archaeology.  In your first year you will have to take 1 unit (out of 4 in total) in either Greek or Latin language,  at least 1 course in History and at least 1 course in Archaeology.  In your second year you must continue for at least half a unit on your chosen language and in your third year you must complete an extended essay (half a unit) on a subject relevant to your studies (of your choosing).  Other than that, you may choose modules from any of the departments depending on where you find your interests lie.Can I take courses outside of the Ancient World as part of my degree?You may, up to a certain point.  You may take up to 1 unit (out of 4 in total) in your first year and 1 unit over your second and third years combined.  I am not sure about taking my course with a year abroad or not -- can I switch?There is a certain amount of flexibility to opt in or out of the study abroad degree, although your decision must be made by the end of your first year as we make arrangements with host institutions after this time.  There are limits to the number of places we can offer at each host university, so it is best not to leave your decision to move into the year abroad too late. Can I take a subject in combination with another?You can take Greek or Latin as a main language in combination with some degrees (see the Joint Degree list). Neither BA Classics nor BA Ancient World are available in combination with other degrees.How do transfers work?a) Within UCLOnce we have made all of our offers (by the end of March) we cannot accept any transfers (there is the possibility of a transfer at the start of term, but this depends on student numbers). Before this, we may consider a transfer from one programme to another provided you meet the degree pre-requisites.  Requests for transfer should be made to Dr Mac Góráin.b) With other institutionsTransfers can only be made to start your second year and MUST be for an equivalent degree.  Your A Level and GCSE grades must meet our pre-requisites.  If you meet these requirements, you need to first apply through UCAS, indicating second year entry, and then if the admissions tutor is willing to further consider the application youneed to pay a £100 fee and complete the APL form. If you meet all the many requirements for APL and the tutor wishes to offer a place it then needs to be sent to the Dean of Students (Academic) for approval.When will I hear if I have been accepted or not?You will hear from us by the end of March.  Because of the January UCAS deadline, late March is the earliest we can make offers.I've missed the UCAS deadline -- can I still apply?The UCAS deadline (typically mid-way through January) is our final deadline for all programmes.  If you miss this, your only option is to wait and apply the following year.Do you hold interviews?We only hold interviews with applicants under exceptional circumstances.I can't make one of the UCL open days: how else can I visit UCL?Unfortunately we don't have the resources to offer individual tours to students but if you are keen to visit and cannot make one of the central open days you can take the UCL Self-Guided Tour and then visit the Department of Greek and Latin at Gordon House. The Admissions Secretary is based in room G01 on the ground floor and will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the degrees the Department offers.  I haven't met the conditions of my offer: what will happen?We will consider students who are near-misses, but the final decision rests with the Arts and Humanities Faculty, and places are not often given to those who do not get the right grades. By the time you have received your results, a decision will have been made on your application and that will not be reversible unless you gain the right grade by having the relevant papers remarked and the new grade received by the faculty by the end of August that year.UCL will not accept any students with a C grade at A Level, and UCL does not participate in clearing.I have question not listed here -- what do I do?Please email the Classics Office

The Intercollegiate MA in Classics is central to Classics and Ancient 
History in London, and attracts students from across the world. The UCL 
Library (which includes the library of the Institute of Archaeology) is 
excellent, and also contains a dedicated library of Egyptology. The 
British Museum and the British Library are both only ten minutes’ walk 
away from UCL; even closer are the University of London Library at 
Senate House, the library of the Institute of Classical Studies, and the
 library of the Warburg Institute. MA students enrolled at UCL are 
automatically members of the Institute of Classical Studies and entitled
 to use its library, one of the best in the world. We have a large staff
 of international experts in Greek and Latin literature, papyrology, 
ancient history, and classical art and archaeology; all are available to
 supervise or advise MA students in their research. The MA in Classics is an intercollegiate degree-programme, 
taught by the participating Departments of Classics, Greek and Latin, 
and History in King’s College London (KCL), Royal Holloway University of
 London (RHUL), and University College London (UCL). Courses within 
these MAs are available to students registered in any of the 
participating Colleges. Courses from the UCL MA in the Reception of the 
Classical World are also available to students in the Intercollegiate 
MA. In addition, note that:Students take a total of 180 credits divided as follows:(A) Three modules chosen from the list of 
courses approved for the Intercollegiate MA, offered at UCL, KCL, or 
RHUL. Each module carries 40 credits (i.e. each will have an assessment 
weighting of 22%). Of these, Note: both of these requirements may be satisfied by a single course.  (B) A compulsory module CLASG099 Research Methods and Dissertation This module carries 60 credits (assessment weighting 34%), and has two components:Courses below are available to UCL students (and all 
Intercollegiate students at KCL and RHUL): note that courses taken by 
UCL students at KCL or RHUL are subject to the academic regulations and 
procedures of those Colleges. If you take a course at a different 
College, that mark will be reported to UCL and will be incorporated into
 your degree; but the rules under which the mark is arrived at are those
 of the College which provides the course. GREEK AND LATIN† Dedicated modules for the MA Classics * Dedicated modules for the MA Reception of The Classical World⁂ Modules make use of BA teaching (all such courses have a 50%
 minimum MA component).  (Please note that while core courses and language courses will run every
year the availability of all other modules may change from year to year depending on staff availability). 
 
  Credit value: CLASGR12 (Intercollegiate MA): 40 credits, CLASGR12A (Intercollegiate MA - one term only): 20 credits; CLASGR01 (UCL MA students outside Classics): 30 credits; CLASGR12B (UCL MA students outside Classics - one term only): 15 credits; Module Tutor: Professor Maria Wyke Class hours: One two-hour class per week Assessment: CLASGR12: two 5,000-word essays; CLASGR12A: one 5,000 word essay; CLASGR01: two 4,000-word essays; CLASGR12B: one 4,000 word essay Pre-requisites: None Content: The course aims to introduce
students to the principal issues, ideas and methods involved in studying the
reception of the classical world across a range of periods, societies, and
media. It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical
cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use
of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also
aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of
the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding
in this field. The course is taught by a range of experts in classical
reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity
to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The
course also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the
centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.In term 1, ‘reception studies’ and its theoretical
approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within
antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary
reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the
Renaissance up to the present day, with an emphasis on material
culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes
tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are
required to take the whole course (40 credits). Other MA students may take the
whole module or just term 1 as a half module (CLASGR12A 20 credits
intercollegiate; or CLASGR12B 15 credits UCL). Skills: By the end of the course, students will be
expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological
approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to
implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various
historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and
sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in
different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an
understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the
classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques
(including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying
reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques
can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions
of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to
analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective. Preperatory reading: Beard, M. and Henderson, J. Classics: A Very Short Introduction

What
distinguishes cinematic histories of Rome from other historical forms? This
course will explore the early experimental period of filmmaking, its turn to
antiquity to legitimate the new cinematic medium, its relationship to painting,
historical fiction, and theatre, and its distinct methods for bringing
antiquity into the modern world (embodiment, colour, music and movement). 
It will also address the development of the star system, sound technology, the
classical Hollywood style, and the emergence and operation of genre. The course
will utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis,
and engage with issues such as sources, narrative structure, and ideology
(including gender & sexuality, colonialism and religion). Films on the
syllabus include The Last Days of Pompeii
(1913), Ben Hur (1925), Cleopatra (1934) and Quo vadis (1951). Skills: By
the end of the module it is expected that students should have the knowledge
and understanding to (1) identify and analyse cinema’s distinctive techniques
for representing the Roman past; (2) appraise cinema’s techniques of historical
analogy; (3) assess their role in the representation and construction of
contemporary gender, sexuality, morality, and politics; (4) account for cinema’s
transformation of ancient Rome into spectacle and commodity; (5) differentiate
between different cinematic styles in their reconstruction and interpretation
of Roman history. Recommended preperatory reading:Wyke, M. Projecting the Past: Ancient Rome, Cinema

representations of ancient Rome on screen and how has its dominance been
challenged? How do ideas of the historical operate in and through such films?
Why did the genre of the Hollywood blockbuster decline in the 1960s and
re-emerge in the twenty-first century? How is cinema changed by the advent of
television, video/DVD, and now the global digital environment? The course will
utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis, and

ancient GreekContent: An introduction to
Mycenaean Greek, including a basic review of Greek historical phonology and
morphology. This course introduces the language, script and history of the
Linear B tablets from Bronze Age Greece: in order to do this effectively it
also serves as a basic introduction to Greek historical phonology and
morphology. By extension, this will include an introduction to Indo-European
studies. A selection of Linear B texts will be studied, with attention to
social, historical and archaeological context: core topics will include the
history of writing in the ancient Aegean and the graphic representation of
Greek; the dialectal affiliations of Mycenaean and Homeric Greek; and the
evidence of the tablets for the history of the Greek language. The course will serve as a
introduction to historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and Indo-European.At the end of the course students
will be able to give an account of the central linguistic issues raised by the
decipherment of the Linear B tablets; will understand how Homeric Greek stands
in relation to Mycenaean and classical Greek; will be familiar with basic linguistic principles and understand how
they inform our analysis of ancient Greek of all periods; will be in a position
to demonstrate how Greek stands in relation to other Indo-European languages.Course texts: a course booklet

devoted to Athenian tragedy of the fifth century BCE, focusing on the theatre
of Sophocles. Apart from the first two hours devoted to
a general introduction to Sophocles and his text, the course
will be organised as a seminar, where we approach the problems of Greek tragedy
and the play through a close collaborative reading, in Greek, of Sophocles'
text. All participants should read the assigned text in
Greek (about 170 lines per session) in preparation for each class.  Also,
a selection of secondary reading has been assigned each week to aid discussion:
participants are asked to get through these selections as well.  This
year, we will focus on the Electra. Topics considered will include
style, interpretation, textual transmission, dramaturgy, the revenge-theme and
the play's connection to other, earlier dramatic and nondramatic versions of
the Orestes story, intertextuality, staging, metre, and social, political and
religious context. For preparation, see
the Cambridge 'Green and Yellow' commentary on the play by J. H. Kells
(available in an inexpensive paperback); the older, but still useful commentary
by Richard Jebb (now published in an a paperback reprint) and the new
commentary by Patrick Finglass (Sophocles,
Electra, Cambridge Classical
Texts and Commentaries vol. 44, Cambridge, 2007).  Skills: Improved
knowledge of tragedy, its contexts and the ancient Greek language; insight into
a variety of important themes connected with Greek drama and its contexts, and
the ability to carry out original research on these questions. Students will
also practice researching a topic of their choice in a mature and independent
way, and will learn the basic techniques of academic research, as well as how
to express their findings well and coherently in writing. Module texts: Sophocles,

course, offered yearly, always focuses on a Greek prose author. This year we
will dedicate ourselves to an intensive study of Aristotle's Poetics, the foundational text of
Western literary criticism and neo-classical poetics. Apart from an initial
two-hour lecture to set the scene, we will focus on a close, collaborative
reading of Aristotle's text in Greek. We will read about five pages of the text
in Greek from week to week. For each week, we will also read some key shorter works
of scholarship on different problems in Aristotle, and I will also bring along
passages which illustrate the development of Greek culture's ways of reflecting
on poetry and poetics up to the philosopher's time, so that we can gain some
notion of the tradition from which the Poetics
springs; and, if time permits, we may read some important passages from the
Rhetoric and Politics as well, which help to illustrate concepts put forward in
the Poetics. Students will be
expected to produce a 5,000-word piece of scholarship, independently
researched, on Aristotle's Poetics and/or
its reception. Students will also be
expected to research and present on key concepts and terms of Aristotelian
theory.    Skills: Insight
into basic questions of literary theory and an understanding of the development
of Greek literary criticism and important themes of the Poetics, as well as the ability to carry out original research on
these questions. Students will also practice researching a topic of their
choice in a mature and independent way, and will learn the basic techniques of
academic research, as well as how to express their findings well and coherently
in writing, and develop facility in making oral presentations in a
non-threatening way.  Recommended preperatory reading:Belfiore, Elizabeth, S., Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion. (Princeton,

This
module will provide an introduction to Cicero the politician and orator as well
a to key elements in the history and political life of the Roman Republic, by a
close look at Cicero’s writings referring to his exile. The course will focus
on reading (in the original Latin) four speeches delivered by Cicero upon his
return (Post reditum in senatu, Post reditum ad Quirites, Pro domo sua, De haruspicum responsis), paying particular attention to his
argument and political strategy and their adaptation in speeches on similar
topics given before different bodies. There will be supplementary reading in
English of some of Cicero’s letters and of excerpts from other speeches. This
will allow for discussion of issues such as aims and methods of Cicero’s
shaping of his persona, his presentation of ‘historical facts’, his view of the
Roman res publica or the possible
reasons for the dissemination of these speeches. Students will be asked
to read about half a speech in Latin per week and one item from the secondary
literature; class discussions each week will be based on this material; there
will also be the chance for students to deliver presentations. Skills:
By
the end of the module, students will be able to read and analyze oratorical
texts within their political and historical context and be able to present
well-argued written and oral conclusions and original ideas. Recommended preperatory reading:D.R. Shackleton

explore two aspects of the interaction between philosophy and literature in the
Classical World. The first is what philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle
have to say about the nature of literature. The second, not unrelated, aspect
is the way that the form and content of ancient philosophy can be seen to be
significantly related. Students will look at a range of texts from across the
ancient canon, including the Presocratics, Plato’s dialogues, Seneca’s letters
and Lucretius’ didactic verse. Those students who are taking this module to
count towards their Language requirement will be expected to engage with the
readings in the original (specifically in their essays). Those students without
Latin or Greek may take this module in translation. Teaching will be balanced
to ensure that it is mostly accessible to everyone. Skills: Students will develop
their ability to criticise and to evaluate arguments, and to present coherent
and extended arguments in writing. They will also develop their sensitivity to
the relationship between the content of an argument and the form in which it is
expressed. Preperatory reading:Barfield,

module will examine the poetry of Ovid, probably the most influential of all
Roman poets on later Western art and literature. It will focus on his great narrative
poem of transformations, the Metamorphoses, examining, amongst other
episodes, the famous stories of Narcissus, Daphne, Philomela, Pygmalion and
Arachne. It will also look at select passages from his other works: his love
poems, the Amores; his versified instruction on pulling the opposite
sex, the Ars amatoria; his
letter-poems written in the voices of famous mythic women, the Heroides; and
his lesser known but equally fascinating works like the Fasti (a
didactic poem on the Roman calendar) and the Tristia (exile poetry).
 Alongside study of passages in the original Latin the course will place
his poetry in its social, historical, and literary context, while also
considering its influence in later periods and its relevance to modern day
concerns. Topics addressed include genre, narrative, style, allusion, humour,
sexuality and gender, violence and aesthetics, Ovid's attitude towards
Augustus, and the post-classical reception of Ovid's poetry in art, film and
literature (including a trip to the National Gallery). Skills:
By the end of the course, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) a
general overview of the style and content of Ovid’s oeuvre in its historical
context, 2) a detailed appreciation of the Metamorphoses
both in the original Latin and in translation and an ability to analyse it from
the perspective of language, genre(s), politics, poetic and philosophical
influences, narrative technique, themes and poetics; 3) an awareness of different
methodological and theoretical approaches to interpreting Ovid’s poetry, an
ability to implement those approaches in practice, and to analyze different
interpretations critically; (4) an appreciation of the post-classical influence
and reception of Ovid’s poetry in a range of historical and cultural contexts. Preperatory reading: Try to read the complete
works of Ovid in translation (the Penguin or World Classics editions are good).

Greek historical writing, taught in English translation (no knowledge of
Ancient Greek language required). In the Classical period prose accounts of the
past were a radical new invention; authoritative narratives about the past had
previously been in verse form, most obviously Homer. The course will examine
how the history of literature changed in this period of huge intellectual
development. We will read the 2 main historical writers of the Classical period
– Herodotus and Thucydides – in literary and cultural context, beginning with
poetic accounts of the past and early experiments in prose, and examining the
interrelation with other genres such as tragedy and rhetoric. The course will
be useful to students coming from a Classics background who have not previously
had much opportunity to study Herodotus or Thucydides and want to understand
more about literary developments of the Classical period, and to students from
an Ancient History background who want to know more about how Classical Greek
history writing works.  Skills: Students will develop
their awareness of critical approaches to history writing, including the
relation of historical content to narrative form and the connections between
historical and other literary genres.

published papyri on the basis of electronic resources and translations 
in English of published documents (40%); (2) an edition of a papyrus or 
an essay (60%) Pre-requisites: None Content: This module aims
to introduce participants to the study of Greek papyri, documentary as well as
literary, and to offer training in editing them. Each class will focus on a
small number of texts, one or two of which will be studied in detail on a
photograph. The texts are chosen to illustrate the development of Greek cursive
scripts and bookhands; to examine formal aspects of the transmission of Greek
literature on papyrus; and to give an idea of the range of documentary types
available as sources for the history of Egypt from the age of the Ptolemies to
late antiquity.  A good knowledge of Greek is essential.   Skills:  Recommended preperatory reading:  The UCL

Our MA in the Reception of the Classical World makes extensive use of the unique features of UCL: its central location, diverse international expertise, interdisciplinary outlook, and close relationship with its sister classics departments in Royal Holloway and Kings College. We provide research tours of nearby research resources, such as the British Museum, the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Sir John Soane’s Museum, and the British Film Institute. Our programme is taught by highly experienced staff from within and outside our department. Students have the opportunity to select courses from a very large range - from within our department, from other departments in UCL, and from the intercollegiate MA programme in Classics.  Watch a short video about the MA Reception in the Classical World at YouTube The programme aims to provide graduate students with a 
thorough grounding in key aspects of and approaches to the reception of 
classical culture – understood broadly as its interpretation, 
appropriation, representation or reconstruction, and/or revision. It 
also aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the 
reception of the classical world by developing their critical and 
conceptual understanding in this field.Students take a total of 180 credits divided as follows:a) A mandatory core course CLASGR12 Approaches to the Reception of the Classical World: 40 credits (assessment weighting 22%)b) Further modules to the value of 80 credits chosen with the approval of the MA Tutor (the combined assesment wieghting of these modules will be 44%).c) CLASGR99 Dissertation:

students to the principal issues, ideas and methods involved in studying the
reception of the classical world across a range of periods, societies, and
media. It will provide key illustrations of different responses to classical
cultures in action and demonstrate how later cultures have viewed and made use
of the classical world from their own historically situated standpoint. It also
aims to equip students with the tools for further research in the reception of
the classical world by developing their critical and conceptual understanding
in this field. The course is taught by a range of experts in classical
reception. It addresses theory, the history of reception (from within antiquity
to the twenty-first century, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean). The
course also explores the engagements of classical antiquity throughout the
centuries with issues of gender, class, race, politics and national identity.In term 1, ‘reception studies’ and its theoretical
approaches are introduced. Case studies of reception are then explored within
antiquity and beyond up to the Renaissance, with a focus mainly on literary
reception. In term 2, case studies of reception are explored from the
Renaissance up to the present day, with an emphasis on material
culture, art, museums, performance, film and political thought (and includes
tours of the Petrie and the British Museums). MA Reception students are
required to take the whole course (40 credits). Other MA students may take the
whole module or just term 1 as a half module (CLASGR12A 20 credits
intercollegiate; or CLASGR12B 15 credits UCL). Skills: By the end of the course, students will be
expected to have acquired: (1) an understanding of different methodological
approaches to studying the reception of the classical world, and an ability to
implement those approaches in practice; (2) an awareness of the various
historical and contextual factors (including religion, politics, gender and
sexuality) that contribute to different receptions of classical cultures in
different historical periods, different societies, and different media; and an
understanding of how these factors might have affected responses to the
classical world in any given case; (3) a knowledge of core research techniques
(including use of bibliographical, archival and digital resources) for studying
reception of the classical world, and an understanding of how these techniques
can be applied to a range of materials; (4) a knowledge of different receptions
of classical cultures over a range of historical periods, and an ability to
analyse those responses critically from an historical and cultural perspective. Preperatory reading: Beard, M. and Henderson, J. Classics: A Very Short Introduction

antiquity into the modern world (embodiment, colour, music and movement). 
It will also address the development of the star system, sound technology, the
classical Hollywood style, and the emergence and operation of genre. The course
will utilise the critical vocabulary of reception studies and film analysis,
and engage with issues such as sources, narrative structure, and ideology
(including gender & sexuality, colonialism and religion). Films on the
syllabus include The Last Days of Pompeii
(1913), Ben Hur (1925), Cleopatra (1934) and Quo vadis (1951). Skills: By
the end of the module it is expected that students should have the knowledge
and understanding to (1) identify and analyse cinema’s distinctive techniques
for representing the Roman past; (2) appraise cinema’s techniques of historical
analogy; (3) assess their role in the representation and construction of
contemporary gender, sexuality, morality, and politics; (4) account for cinema’s
transformation of ancient Rome into spectacle and commodity; (5) differentiate

class in term one; in term two there will be a dedicated MA class (time to be
arrange to suit participants).Assessment: CLASGG16: ten completed weekly assignments (30%), a project/essay of 4000 words (35%), one unseen two-hour written examination (35%); CLASGG07: ten completed weekly assignments (30%), a project/essay of 3000 words (35%), one unseen two-hour written examination (35%)Pre-requisites: Two years of
ancient GreekContent: An introduction to
Mycenaean Greek, including a basic review of Greek historical phonology and
morphology. This course introduces the language, script and history of the
Linear B tablets from Bronze Age Greece: in order to do this effectively it
also serves as a basic introduction to Greek historical phonology and
morphology. By extension, this will include an introduction to Indo-European
studies. A selection of Linear B texts will be studied, with attention to
social, historical and archaeological context: core topics will include the
history of writing in the ancient Aegean and the graphic representation of
Greek; the dialectal affiliations of Mycenaean and Homeric Greek; and the
evidence of the tablets for the history of the Greek language. The course will serve as a
introduction to historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and Indo-European.At the end of the course students
will be able to give an account of the central linguistic issues raised by the
decipherment of the Linear B tablets; will understand how Homeric Greek stands
in relation to Mycenaean and classical Greek; will be familiar with basic linguistic principles and understand how
they inform our analysis of ancient Greek of all periods; will be in a position
to demonstrate how Greek stands in relation to other Indo-European languages.Course texts: a course booklet
will be supplied.S. COLVIN,  A

devoted to Athenian tragedy of the fifth century BCE, focusing on the theatre
of Sophocles. Apart from the first two hours devoted to
a general introduction to Sophocles and his text, the course
will be organised as a seminar, where we approach the problems of Greek tragedy
and the play through a close collaborative reading, in Greek, of Sophocles'
text. All participants should read the assigned text in
Greek (about 170 lines per session) in preparation for each class.  Also,
a selection of secondary reading has been assigned each week to aid discussion:
participants are asked to get through these selections as well.  This
year, we will focus on the Electra. Topics considered will include
style, interpretation, textual transmission, dramaturgy, the revenge-theme and
the play's connection to other, earlier dramatic and nondramatic versions of
the Orestes story, intertextuality, staging, metre, and social, political and
religious context. For preparation, see
the Cambridge 'Green and Yellow' commentary on the play by J. H. Kells
(available in an inexpensive paperback); the older, but still useful commentary
by Richard Jebb (now published in an a paperback reprint) and the new
commentary by Patrick Finglass (Sophocles,
Electra, Cambridge Classical
Texts and Commentaries vol. 44, Cambridge, 2007).  Skills: Improved
knowledge of tragedy, its contexts and the ancient Greek language; insight into
a variety of important themes connected with Greek drama and its contexts, and
the ability to carry out original research on these questions. Students will
also practice researching a topic of their choice in a mature and independent
way, and will learn the basic techniques of academic research, as well as how
to express their findings well and coherently in writing. Module texts: Sophocles,

course, offered yearly, always focuses on a Greek prose author. This year we
will dedicate ourselves to an intensive study of Aristotle's Poetics, the foundational text of
Western literary criticism and neo-classical poetics. Apart from an initial
two-hour lecture to set the scene, we will focus on a close, collaborative
reading of Aristotle's text in Greek. We will read about five pages of the text
in Greek from week to week. For each week, we will also read some key shorter works
of scholarship on different problems in Aristotle, and I will also bring along
passages which illustrate the development of Greek culture's ways of reflecting
on poetry and poetics up to the philosopher's time, so that we can gain some
notion of the tradition from which the Poetics
springs; and, if time permits, we may read some important passages from the
Rhetoric and Politics as well, which help to illustrate concepts put forward in
the Poetics. Students will be
expected to produce a 5,000-word piece of scholarship, independently
researched, on Aristotle's Poetics and/or
its reception. Students will also be
expected to research and present on key concepts and terms of Aristotelian
theory.    Skills: Insight
into basic questions of literary theory and an understanding of the development
of Greek literary criticism and important themes of the Poetics, as well as the ability to carry out original research on
these questions. Students will also practice researching a topic of their
choice in a mature and independent way, and will learn the basic techniques of
academic research, as well as how to express their findings well and coherently
in writing, and develop facility in making oral presentations in a
non-threatening way.  Recommended preperatory reading:Belfiore, Elizabeth, S., Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion. (Princeton,

This
module will provide an introduction to Cicero the politician and orator as well
a to key elements in the history and political life of the Roman Republic, by a
close look at Cicero’s writings referring to his exile. The course will focus
on reading (in the original Latin) four speeches delivered by Cicero upon his
return (Post reditum in senatu, Post reditum ad Quirites, Pro domo sua, De haruspicum responsis), paying particular attention to his
argument and political strategy and their adaptation in speeches on similar
topics given before different bodies. There will be supplementary reading in
English of some of Cicero’s letters and of excerpts from other speeches. This
will allow for discussion of issues such as aims and methods of Cicero’s
shaping of his persona, his presentation of ‘historical facts’, his view of the
Roman res publica or the possible
reasons for the dissemination of these speeches. Students will be asked
to read about half a speech in Latin per week and one item from the secondary
literature; class discussions each week will be based on this material; there
will also be the chance for students to deliver presentations. Skills:
By
the end of the module, students will be able to read and analyze oratorical
texts within their political and historical context and be able to present
well-argued written and oral conclusions and original ideas. Recommended preperatory reading:D.R. Shackleton

explore two aspects of the interaction between philosophy and literature in the
Classical World. The first is what philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle
have to say about the nature of literature. The second, not unrelated, aspect
is the way that the form and content of ancient philosophy can be seen to be
significantly related. Students will look at a range of texts from across the
ancient canon, including the Presocratics, Plato’s dialogues, Seneca’s letters
and Lucretius’ didactic verse. Those students who are taking this module to
count towards their Language requirement will be expected to engage with the
readings in the original (specifically in their essays). Those students without
Latin or Greek may take this module in translation. Teaching will be balanced
to ensure that it is mostly accessible to everyone. Skills: Students will develop
their ability to criticise and to evaluate arguments, and to present coherent
and extended arguments in writing. They will also develop their sensitivity to
the relationship between the content of an argument and the form in which it is
expressed. Preperatory reading:Barfield,

module will examine the poetry of Ovid, probably the most influential of all
Roman poets on later Western art and literature. It will focus on his great narrative
poem of transformations, the Metamorphoses, examining, amongst other
episodes, the famous stories of Narcissus, Daphne, Philomela, Pygmalion and
Arachne. It will also look at select passages from his other works: his love
poems, the Amores; his versified instruction on pulling the opposite
sex, the Ars amatoria; his
letter-poems written in the voices of famous mythic women, the Heroides; and
his lesser known but equally fascinating works like the Fasti (a
didactic poem on the Roman calendar) and the Tristia (exile poetry).
 Alongside study of passages in the original Latin the course will place
his poetry in its social, historical, and literary context, while also
considering its influence in later periods and its relevance to modern day
concerns. Topics addressed include genre, narrative, style, allusion, humour,
sexuality and gender, violence and aesthetics, Ovid's attitude towards
Augustus, and the post-classical reception of Ovid's poetry in art, film and
literature (including a trip to the National Gallery). Skills:
By the end of the course, students will be expected to have acquired: (1) a
general overview of the style and content of Ovid’s oeuvre in its historical
context, 2) a detailed appreciation of the Metamorphoses
both in the original Latin and in translation and an ability to analyse it from
the perspective of language, genre(s), politics, poetic and philosophical
influences, narrative technique, themes and poetics; 3) an awareness of different
methodological and theoretical approaches to interpreting Ovid’s poetry, an
ability to implement those approaches in practice, and to analyze different
interpretations critically; (4) an appreciation of the post-classical influence
and reception of Ovid’s poetry in a range of historical and cultural contexts. Preperatory reading: Try to read the complete
works of Ovid in translation (the Penguin or World Classics editions are good).

Greek historical writing, taught in English translation (no knowledge of
Ancient Greek language required). In the Classical period prose accounts of the
past were a radical new invention; authoritative narratives about the past had
previously been in verse form, most obviously Homer. The course will examine
how the history of literature changed in this period of huge intellectual
development. We will read the 2 main historical writers of the Classical period
– Herodotus and Thucydides – in literary and cultural context, beginning with
poetic accounts of the past and early experiments in prose, and examining the
interrelation with other genres such as tragedy and rhetoric. The course will
be useful to students coming from a Classics background who have not previously
had much opportunity to study Herodotus or Thucydides and want to understand
more about literary developments of the Classical period, and to students from
an Ancient History background who want to know more about how Classical Greek
history writing works.  Skills: Students will develop
their awareness of critical approaches to history writing, including the
relation of historical content to narrative form and the connections between
historical and other literary genres.  Credit value: CLASGG17 (Intercollegiate MA): 20 credits, CLASGG03 (UCL MA students outside Classics): 30 credits Module Tutor: Professor Nick Gonis Class hours: One two-hour class per week Assessment: Two written assignments:  (1) a 'take-home' exercise in identifying 
published papyri on the basis of electronic resources and translations 
in English of published documents (40%); (2) an edition of a papyrus or 
an essay (60%) Pre-requisites: None Content: This module aims
to introduce participants to the study of Greek papyri, documentary as well as
literary, and to offer training in editing them. Each class will focus on a
small number of texts, one or two of which will be studied in detail on a
photograph. The texts are chosen to illustrate the development of Greek cursive
scripts and bookhands; to examine formal aspects of the transmission of Greek
literature on papyrus; and to give an idea of the range of documentary types
available as sources for the history of Egypt from the age of the Ptolemies to
late antiquity.  A good knowledge of Greek is essential.   Skills:  Recommended preperatory reading:  The UCL

A: To start the MA in Classics you must have either Greek or Latin at advanced (typically BA) level. You
 do not need Greek or Latin language to start the MA in the Reception of
 the Classical World. Greek and Latin are of course an advantage, and 
you may start (or continue) them in a dedicated MA language class as 
part of your MA programme.A:
 For UK students we ask for a good 2:1 degree or higher in a relevant 
subject, and an equivalent level from students from universities outside
 the UK. This translates into a minimum GPA of 3.5 for North American 
students, and 7.5/10 for Greek students. In the case of mature students 
there is a good deal of flexibility in admissions (see below).A:
 The UCL requirement in English for non-native speakers is an IELTS 
score at ‘good’ level or recognised equivalent. (Students who have an 
undergraduate degree from a university in the English-speaking world are
 exempt from this requirement.)A: Yes, dedicated MA modules in both languages are run every year, at both Beginner and Intermediate levels. A: The MA runs for almost a full year, from the beginning of October until the middle of the following September. Students
 take taught modules to the
value of 120 credits (each module carries 40 or 20 credits) and write a 
dissertation of approximately 12,000 words. The modules run during the 
two University teaching terms (October – December and January – March): 
each term lasts eleven weeks, with a Reading week in the middle. The 
deadline for coursework is typically the 1st of June. Most of the work 
on the dissertation takes place after coursework has been submitted 
(i.e. from June to September).A: Many
 students take the MA part-time over two years. This is the only viable 
option for students who need to work while doing the MA.Part-time 
students typically take two modules in the first year, and one course 
plus the dissertation in the second year. Note that normal coursework 
deadlines apply for all courses (i.e. course-work has to be submitted by
 the 1st of June in each year). A: A
 typical MA course is taught in one two-hour seminar per week. A normal 
load will therefore involve six hours of class time per week. Beginners’
 language classes may run for three hours per week. A: MA courses are taught in
 small seminars or classes, rarely exceeding a dozen participants. MA 
students are expected to prepare for class each week, typically by 
reading preparatory material and texts in the original Greek or Latin. 
In almost all MA courses (apart from Beginners’ and Intermediate 
language classes) students are expected to give one or more 
presentations during the course of the year. A: No, modules 
are almost never scheduled to run after normal office hours. Birkbeck 
College offers both BA and MA programmes with night classes. A: Students 
in the Intercollegiate MA in Classics can take modules at any of the 
three Colleges. Supervision of dissertations, however, is normally 
conducted at the student’s own College.Students in the MA in the 
Reception of the Classical World are allowed to import any MA module 
from the Intercollegiate MA, subject to permission from the programme 
director. A: A
 small number of courses are mixed MA/BA courses. However, instructors 
must provide MA students with at least 50% of their class hours in a 
dedicated MA class. MA students may not take more than two courses which
 make use of BA teaching. A: No, not 
unless they are flagged as mixed MA/BA courses. However, MA students may
 sit in on BA courses with the permission of the relevant instructor. A: All
 MA programmes are extremely flexible, allowing students to tailor their
 programmes of study to their specific interests. MA students may import
 courses both from related MA tracks (Classics, Ancient History, Art and
 Archaeology, and the Reception of the Classical world), and also from 
other MA programmes in UCL or the University of London (where 
appropriate). A: Almost
 all MA modules require written coursework to be submitted (exceptions 
include beginners’ language courses, which may be assessed by means of 
an exam). A typical load for an MA modules would be two essays or 
projects of 5000 words each (or three shorter pieces, max. 10,000 
words): it is therefore perfectly normal for an MA student to have six 
or more pieces of work to submit by the June 1st deadline. Many modules 
specify that the first piece of work should be submitted by the end of 
the first term, and the second piece of work by the end of the second 
term. A:
 All instructors have at least two hours a week when they are in their 
offices and available to see students without appointment (‘Office 
Hours’). It is also possible to make an appointment to see a member of 
teaching staff. A: 
MA students have access to all UCL libraries (holdings in Classics, 
Ancient History, Comparative Philology and Archaeology are excellent), 
the library of the Institute of Classical Studies, the library of the 
University of London in Senate House, and the British Library. In 
addition, access is generally granted to the libraries of almost all 
relevant Colleges and Institutes of the University of London. A: 
Every year a large number of foreign students joins the MA programme: 
students come from across the European Union, North America, Australia, 
New Zealand and elsewhere. Historically we have had a consistent number 
of students from Greece, Italy and Cyprus. A: 
Yes, there is always a sizeable minority of students who have not come 
immediately out of a BA programme; many join us considerably later in 
life. We welcome applications from people of all ages; admissions 
criteria are of course more flexible for mature applicants. A: The deadline for applications is the first Friday in August each year. Most applications arrive between January and May: it is important to apply early if you would like accommodation from UCL. A: There
 is some variation from year to year, although MA modules in core 
subjects are of course run regularly. In general this year’s modules on our website will give a good idea of the nature and range of modules on 
offer in a typical year. Modules for the next academic year are 
generally posted online in spring; times are not generally fixed until 
shortly before the term starts. Please note that due to the very 
high number of modules on offer it is impossible to avoid some clashes 
in the timetabling of MA modules. A: We offer studentships for MA study. Our funding page contains further information. A:
 The MA is an ideal springboard for a PhD programme. Every year a 
handful of students go on to start PhD research; acceptance into the PhD
 programme at UCL depends on performance in the MA (especially the 
dissertation).MA in Classical Art & Archaeology 
 An MA in this area is now administered by the Institute of 
Archaeology. Applications for admission should be directed to the Institute of Archaeology: please address enquiries to Dr Jeremy Tanner.

The Department of Greek and Latin has a weekly research seminar, the Lyceum Classics Community Seminar (LCCS), run by postgraduate students (both PhD and MA) for postgraduate students in UCL Department of Greek and Latin. It meets Wednesdays at 4:00pm. The primary aim of this series is to provide both a regular point of social contact among students in the Department and an ideal forum for them to present an overview or aspects of their work. These seminars are also intended to be a relaxed and supportive environment for junior researchers to practice public speaking and develop their communicational and presentational skills.  The LCCS will be running throughout academic year (October to May). Normally presentations will last 20-30 minutes followed by discussions of 15 minutes. We offer free muffins and coffee/ tea to boost morale. Venue: Gordon House G-09Attendance at the seminar counts for one extra point in UCL research log. Abstracts will be circulated ahead of each paper. Staff members who would like to attend please contact the organiser ahead of time. If you have any questions, would like more information, or would like to speak at a future seminar, please contact the organiser Manuela Irarrázabal.

Grants are available for PhD students to attend conferences and for other necessary research expenses (e.g. travel to examine a manuscript). Please note:Research grants for students who are funded by the LAHP (or by the AHRC before 2014) are administered by the LAHP office Students who are supported by a UCL Graduate Research Studentship (GRS) may draw on an annual allowance of £1000 for research expenses. This money may be used towards attending conferences, and other research travel (for example, to examine a manuscript abroad).Other necessary research expenses may be allowed: students should consult their supervisors or the PhD tutor. In certain circumstances conference expenses may be paid even if the student is not giving a paper. All expenses should be approved in advance by the supervisor and PhD tutor.Applications for funding are considered by the Department. The Association generously makes bursaries available for students who wish to attend the annual CA conference, which takes place in April. Applications for these bursaries are handled by the Head of Department, whom students should contact if they wish to be considered. The closing date for these applications is likely to be around the last Friday in January.Various Learned Societies provide support for students to attend conferences.

 There are plenty of opportunities for PhD students to spend a term in a university abroad. The Department encourages students to think about this.Note: you will need to allow plenty of time to set up a visit. All students can visit one of our partner Universities in the European Erasmus exchange programme. We currently have Erasmus agreements with universities in Cyprus (Nicosia), France (Paris IV; Strasbourg), Germany (Heidelberg; Würzburg), Greece (Thessaloniki), Hungary (EOTVOS, Budapest), Italy (Bologna; Parma; Siena), Spain (Salamanca; Valencia), and Switzerland (Geneva). Our Erasmus tutor Dr Rosie Harman will be happy to advise. UCL and Yale have a collaborative relationship, which includes the facilitation of exchange visits for PhD students. Please contact the UCL Yale office for details.The Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (German Academic Exchange Service) offers a range of grants to research students to visit German universities. Deadlines are in October and April.We have an exchange programme with the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa which is open to PhD students. Please see the Graduate Tutor for details.The Department will help PhD students who wish to make their own arrangements to work with scholars at universities abroad. Please bear in mind that if no formal exchange agreement exists, you may be liable to pay fees at the foreign institution.

Learning how to be an effective teacher is an important part of a PhD student's training. The Department and the College take this very seriously, and there are a number of training programmes available for students, some compulsory and some elective.The Department aims to offer all PhD students the opportunity to teach. This will not usually happen until the student is in the second year of the PhD programme. PhD students work with a member of staff as a Post-Graduate Teaching Assistant (PGTA): typically this involves dividing the teaching on a large course. All classes with a PGTA will have a complete week-by-week teaching schedule on the Moodle page to make teaching preparation more convenient for the PGTA(s).PGTAs should meet regularly with the course tutor to discuss progress.All postgraduate students are welcome to take training courses in Moodle and other electronic resources with UCL Information Systems.

A: The Graduate Tutor can advise you whether a specialist in your proposed field could supervise you, and can answer any general questions about UCL that you may have. It is good idea to send a draft research proposal when you contact us: one page (more if you wish) with a sketch of your ideas for your PhD
    research. If we feel that we can provide appropriate supervision for you, we will ask you to submit a PhD application so that we can take up references. A: Yes, if you wish.A: All applicants must have completed an MA programme or equivalent post-undergraduate degree, either at UCL or elsewhere. A good performance in the dissertation component of the MA is especially important (for example, in the London MA in Classics we would look for a mark at or near Distinction level). A: The Graduate Tutor can advise on this. Including a piece of writing such as an MA dissertation with an application is often helpful. A:
 The UCL requirement in English for non-native speakers is an IELTS 
score at ‘good’ level or recognised equivalent. Details are available on
 the Graduate School website. (Students who have an undergraduate degree from a university in the English-speaking world are exempt from this requirement.)A: Yes, there is always a sizeable minority of students who have not come immediately out of a BA/MA programme; many join us considerably later in life. We welcome applications from people of all ages; admissions criteria are of course more flexible for mature applicants. A: Yes, around a third of our PhD students enrol as part-time students. It is the best  option for students who need to work while doing the PhD, or who have other responsibilities. Part-time students have seven years rather than the standard four years to complete their dissertations (but may submit before then if they wish).A: Both supervisors must usually be at UCL. The only exception is for universities within London: it is possible to have a second supervisor at King's College London, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University of London, or the School of Advanced Study (London).A: No, though if you are enrolled for a PhD at a foreign university it is possible to be a visiting research student at UCL to work with a member of staff here. A: After we receive a formal application, decisions are made quickly (typically within a month); an offer may specify certain minimum grades in an MA programme or equivalent.A: No, but you should leave yourself plenty of time, especially if you need to apply for funding. For most of the common sources of funding (the AHRC and UCL studentships), you need to have an offer of a place at UCL before your application for funding can be considered. The deadlines for AHRC and UCL funding are typically in late January.A: Most offers of a place are conditional upon MA results: students may be allowed to enrol provisionally in the College in September, on the understanding that this status will lapse if the required marks are not achieved. A: No, though an important advantage in starting at this time is that UCL lays on a number of induction sessions and training courses at the beginning of the year. Some of these are repeated in January for students who need to start then; but it is theoretically possible to start at any time.A: Universities in the UK cannot, unfortunately, offer automatic funding to all PhD students. Funding for research students in the Arts and Humanities at UCL comes mostly from two sources: the AHRC (a UK government body), and a limited number of studentships offered by UCL. Some students also win financial support from private foundations. See our guidelines on postgraduate funding. A: Ancient history at UCL is located in the Department of History, and classical archaeology and art history are based in the UCL Institute of Archaeology: you should apply directly to the History Department or the Institute of Archaeology if that is where your primary research interest lies. However, many projects at PhD level are interdisciplinary: staff in the three Departments collaborate to offer a programme of study of the ancient mediterranean world. If your project includes the study of ancient language, literature, or philosophy as a major element, contact the Department of Greek and Latin: we will arrange for a co-supervisor in ancient history or archaeology as necessary.

To be eligible to apply for an AHRC award you must be ordinarily resident in the UK or European Union. Doctoral awards provide support for up to three years of full-time study, or up to five years of part-time study, to enable students to pursue and complete a programme of doctoral research and gain a doctoral degree. The AHRC expects full-time award holders to submit their doctoral thesis within four years of the start of their award. Part-time students should submit their thesis within seven years. To be eligible to apply for an award under the Doctoral Awards Scheme, you should normally have gained a first degree from a recognised HEI and it is normally expected of you to have, or be studying for, a Master’s degree or similar postgraduate qualification. A full award covers both the cost of tuition fees, up to the Research Council maximum, and a maintenance grant. Arrangements for 2017-18The AHRC-funded London Arts & Humanities Partnership (LAHP) brings together three leading UK research organisations: King’s College London (King’s), the School of Advanced Study (SAS) and University College London (UCL). The LAHP AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership will fund up to 80 research studentships per year across the Arts and Humanities in the three partner institutions. Under the scheme it is possible for research students to have their two supervisors in different LAHP institutions. Applicants: please look at the LAHP website for details. You may also subscribe to the LAHP Twitter account for news updates.For applicants in1) You should be in the process of applying for doctoral research at your chosen institution and have established your supervisor(s) before applying to LAHP for funding. It is important to contact potential supervisors as early as possible. 2) The application system for LAHP funding will open on 27 November 2017 and close 14 January 2017 at midnight. Applications are made via the LAHP website. 3) Applicants for LAPH funding must submit their PhD application to UCL Admissions by the start of January 2018 at the latest. Applications will only be considered if the applicant has been in contact with the Department in the normal way to discuss the research proposal and potential supervisors. This is part of the PhD admission process, and you need to allow enough time for this prior to submitting your application. Last-minute applications that have not been discussed will not be considered for funding. 4) Applicants in  Greek and Latin literature, language, ancient philosophy, reception: please contact the Department of Greek and Latin to discuss your research proposal. 5) Applicants in Ancient History: please contact the Department of History to discuss your research proposal. The LAHP will contact successful applicants in mid-March 2018.The UCL Graduate School offers scholarships to UK/EU students and for oversees students. Up to 15 UCL Graduate School Research Scholarships (GSRS) are available annually to prospective and current UCL MPhil/PhD students from any country. a) You must have submitted an application to UCL for full-or part-time MPhil/PhD research before you can apply. Your application to UCL will be used as the basis of your application for a scholarship. b) The scholarships consist of fees equivalent to the standard postgraduate UK/EU rate plus a maintenance stipend of £15,590 per annum for full-time study. (Benefits are pro-rated for part-time students.) Scholarships are tenable during years 1, 2 and 3 of the MPhil/PhD programme, subject to annual review and renewal. c) Deadline: Friday 5 January 2018. Please send applications to Mr Robbie Macaulay in

All MPhil/PhD students are governed by UCL regulations and procedures as set out in the Academic Manual.All students are initially registered for an MPhil and are transferred to full PhD status on satisfactory completion of the upgrade procedure, which is explained below. There is an Induction Programme in the first week of term for new students: there is an additional orientation programme for international students. Each student is assigned a First and Second supervisor. The exact division of responsibility between the two supervisors is a matter for negotiation. The First Supervisor will have specialist knowledge of the general area of research, and will meet regularly with the student; the Second Supervisor may be in a different Department, if that is useful: s/he will be available for consultation, and will read all chapters and give general advice. In the first year students: a) Work with the supervisors to establish the research project which will be the basis for the dissertation (see §1.4 below)b) Take courses in the Skills Development Programme in the UCL Doctoral School. These include: reading in foreign languages (particularly French and German), bibliographic skills, using databases, writing and presentation skills, and many more. Research training is also offered by the London Arts and Humanities Partnership. c) Attend seminars in the Department, and at the Institute of Classical Studies (see §5 below). All new research students entering UCL are required by the College Graduate School to maintain an online Research Log.All students are required to fill in the Research Log at regular intervals: their Supervisors and the Graduate Tutor have access to the Log and will check that this is done. The Log provides a flexible framework for recording details related to the student's research programme, including supervisory meetings and activities concerning the development of academic and key skills. The Log is designed to help students a) to assess their progress b) to plan the next stage of their researchc) to chart evidence of the development of specific and generic research skills (all courses taken in the UCL Skills Development Programme are logged)In normal circumstances research students have taken a relevant MA degree and are already experienced in devising an original and manageable topic, and, with supervisory advice, completing successfully a research dissertation.  The first step towards defining an MPhil/PhD topic is taken on the application form to the Department. Students receive initial advice from potential supervisors regarding its viability and originality. They subsequently modify, revise and refine the research topic, gradually identifying the contents and direction of each chapter, as well as the overall thrust and argument of the thesis.  In the second year students: a) Work with supervisors in preparation for the Upgrade procedure (see below)b) Are encouraged to teach for the Department, under supervision, in order to acquire teaching skills useful for an academic careerc) Continue to take courses in the Skills Development Programme (see above)d) Are encouraged to attend national and international conference in their field of study (UCL provides funding for this); they often help in the organisation of conferences in the Department.e) Attend seminars in the Department, and at the Institute of Classical Studies (see below). The upgrade to PhD normally occurs in the second year, for full-time students (in the third or fourth year for part-time students). For the upgrade, students are asked to provide written evidence of their research progress, consisting of a draft chapter of approximately 10,000 words, a draft outline of the proposed dissertation and a bibliography. They are then invited to discuss their research with a panel of members of staff. See the UCL upgrade guidelines for full information. The department has a range of exchange links across Europe through the Erasmus scheme, and an exchange scheme with Yale University. These are available to postgraduate research students. In the third year students are busy working with supervisors on the final stages of their research project. They are encouraged to attend seminars and conferences in their field in London and elsewhere: these are an important part of research training. The Classical Association annual general meeting is particularly important in this respect. In and after the second year students  may wish to offer a seminar paper at one of these events. UCL offers funding to PhD students to attend conferences, and for other necessary research purposes.After three years of full-time enrolment (six years part-time), students are entitled to an addition period of registration at UCL without payment of further fees: this is known as Completing Research Status (CRS), and lasts for one year (two years part-time). The thesis must be submitted by the end of the Completing Research period.It is very important to complete your PhD thesis within the allotted time. Extensions will only be granted in exceptional circumstances (illness, etc.).About six months before completion of the thesis, students should submit the examination entry form. This requires discussion with the student’s supervisor(s). The PhD dissertation is examined in a viva voce examination with two Examiners. At least one examiner must be external to UCL: in practice both examiners are usually external to UCL (one is often from another College of the University of London). The Examiners can recommend one of the following options:a) that the dissertation is passed and the candidate is awarded the degree of PhDb) that the dissertation is passed subject to minor correctionsc) that the dissertation be referred for major corrections or rewriting, and is resubmitted within 18 months: a second viva voce exam may be required by the Examiners d) that the dissertation is awarded the degree of MPhil; or that no award is made. The Department hosts seminars and lectures throughout the year. As researchers, students should make every effort to attend these. All Departmental conferences are free to PhD students in the Department of Greek and Latin. Students present their work to the Department (all staff and research students): this takes place in a friendly and informal atmosphere, and is designed to foster presentation skills. All students enrolled in the PhD programme at UCL are members of the Institute of Classical Studies of the University of London. The Institute of Classical Studies runs one of the richest programmes of research in the field of Classics in the world. Students are strongly encouraged to attend the seminars in their field.

book 1, ed. J.H. Sleeman (Bristol, 2002), Bristol Classical Press Term 2 Homer Odyssey 11, ed. W.B. Stanford, Homer, Odyssey 1-12. (London, 1996)Content:
 A study of Classical Greek Language, involving
the reading and translation into English of prose and verse texts, exercise in
grammatical analysis and literary criticism and the translation of English
sentences into Greek. The course is designed for those who already have a good A-level
knowledge of the language or have passed Intermediate Greek B. It prepares
students for studying whole works in the original language and therefore
provides a step towards Greek Texts 2. The module consists of two elements: (i)
Reading of sections of relatively easy texts of classical Greek prose and verse
which are prepared in advanced and worked through in detail in class. This will
include comment on style and grammar. (ii) The systematic study and revision of
the principles of Greek language and syntax, which are best learned by practice
in translating English into Greek. For the verse component of the module,
students will be expected to read 640 lines of Homer; for the prose component,
they will be expected to read around 26 chapters of Herodotus.This module may be
taken as whole unit (two texts) or a half-unit (one text). Students taking the
course as a half-unit are expected to take it in the first term. Anyone
starting the course in the second term may do so only with explicit permission
from the Departmental Tutor.Skills: In addition
to improving their skills at reading and writing ancient Greek, this module
offers students the opportunity to develop their skills at linguistic and
literary analysis and criticism. Value: GREK7006 - 1.0 course unit; GREK7006A - 0.5 course units (both can be retaken,
to study a different text, under the code GREK7016)*Code
GREK7016 needs to be selected on Portico by students who have already taken
GREK7006 and studied different texts and GREK7016A needs to be selected on
Portico by students who have already taken GREK7006A and studied different texts.Course Tutor: Dr P A AgócsClass hours: One two-hour class per week or two one-hour classes per week (TBA), Terms 1 and 2. Pre-requisites:
Normally GREK2006/2006A Greek Texts 1/1A or equivalent.   Assessment: GREK7006: Two pieces of coursework of 2,500
words maximum each (12.5+12.5%=25%) and one unseen three hour examination paper (75%) ; GREK7006A: one piece of coursework of 2,500 words maximum (25%) and one
unseen two-hour examination paper (75%). Pre-requisite:
Normally GREK2006/2006A Greek Texts 1/1A or equivalent.Content: The aim of this
course is to broaden and deepen students' knowledge of two major texts or
important genres of Greek literature in the original language and further to
develop students' ability to read and understand Greek texts in their literary
and historical context. It may be
taken as whole unit (two texts) or a half-unit (one text in either the first or
the second term).  In the first term, we will read
Plato's discussions of poetry, poetics, and literary criticism, focusing on the
Ion and selections from Republic 3 and 10. Questions to consider will include the origins
of Greek literary theory and notions of art and the work of art; orality and
literacy (performance and text); the theory of mimesis; the ambiguities of the philosopher's argument; poetry,
inspiration and the Muses; the meaning and authority of the Homeric tradition,
the political, ethical and social role of poetry and its place in Plato's
philosophy and political theory; the 'quarrel of poetry and philosophy'; and
the impact of Plato's theories on the development of Western literary
criticism. In the second term, we will read a selection of Homeric Hymns, late archaic hexameter hymns dedicated to various
gods. Questions to consider will include the history of the text; the function of
the poetry in its original contexts of performance; analysis of poetic form and
style; Greek religion, religious discourse, myth and aetiology; the development
of the hexameter ('epic') poetic tradition after the songs of Homer; the
political role of cults and sanctuaries in the archaic period; the influence of
Near Eastern poetic and religious traditions on Greek myth, and other relevant
themes. Text and commentary for each term:1) for term one, we will read Penelope Murray, Plato On Poetry (Cambridge Greek and Latin Texts: Cambridge, 1996).2) in term two: Nicholas Richardson, Three
Homeric Hymns: To Apollo, Hermes, Aphrodite (Cambridge Greek and Latin
Texts, 2010). Skills: By the end of the course, students should be trained in close reading, analysis
of form, content and context, and the ability to present written conclusions
about a complex body of data in a coherent fashion. They will also have better
Greek than they had when they started, and will be able to carry out
independent research into the important themes of Greek and modern poetics, and
ancient Greek poetry, culture, myth and religion. Introductory readings: For term 1: Thomas Szlezák, Reading Plato (Routledge, 1999); Eric Havelock, Preface to Plato (Harvard, 1963);
Stephen Halliwell, The
Aesthetics of Mimesis. Ancient Texts and Modern Problems (Princeton 2002); A. Ford, The
Origins of Criticism (Princeton, 2001).For term 2: Jenny Strauss Clay, The Politics of Olympus: Form and Meaning in the Major Homeric Hymns
(London, 2006); Richard Janko, Homer,
Hesiod and the Hymns (Cambridge, 1982); J. Notopoulos, 'The Homeric Hymns
as Oral Poetry', American Journal of
Philology 83 (1962): 337-368; W. Burkert, Greek Religion (Harvard, 1985).Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutors: Dr Nicolò Benzi (Term 1) and Professor Nick Gonis (Term 2) Class hours: One one-hour class
per week, Terms 1 and 2.  Assessment: One three-hour
examination paper (100%) Pre-requisite: GREK2002 Intermediate
Greek B or equivalent Content: A course of exercises and discussions designed to
improve fluency of unprepared translation into English from Greek prose and
verse authors. Weekly classes provide practice in unseen translation of a
wide-ranging selection of Greek prose and verse authors. Classwork focuses upon
discussion of grammar and grammatical style, common pitfalls and hints about
translation techniques as well as practical exercises. Skills: By the end of the course students will have had
sufficient practice to be able to apply their knowledge and thus make
reasonable assumptions regarding the content of an unseen passage. Value: 1.0 course unitsCourse
Tutor: Prof. Stephen
Colvin Class hours: One two-hour class
per week, Terms 1 and 2.  Assessment: On unseen three-hour written exam (100%).  Formative assessment: One problem
sheet per week (to be handed in the following week). Pre-requisites: Two years of
ancient Greek Content: An introduction to
Mycenaean Greek, including a basic review of Greek historical phonology and
morphology. This course introduces the language, script and history of the
Linear B tablets from Bronze Age Greece: in order to do this effectively it
also serves as a basic introduction to Greek historical phonology and
morphology. By extension, this will include an introduction to Indo-European
studies. A selection of Linear B texts will be studied, with attention to
social, historical and archaeological context: core topics will include the
history of writing in the ancient Aegean and the graphic representation of
Greek; the dialectal affiliations of Mycenaean and Homeric Greek; and the
evidence of the tablets for the history of the Greek language.  The course will serve as a
introduction to historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and Indo-European. Course texts: a course booklet
will be supplied. S. COLVIN,  A
Historical Greek Reader (Oxford 2007): not necessary to purchase J.T. HOOKER, Linear B: an introduction (Bristol 1980): recommended Other recommended preparatory
readings: J. CHADWICK, The Decipherment of Linear B

week, Term 2. Assessment: One unseen three-hour
examination paper (100%) Pre-requisites: Normally GREK2006/2006A
Greek Texts 1/1A or equivalentContent: An introduction to the
study of Greek papyri, documentary as well as literary, each class will focus
on a small number of texts, one or two of which will be studied in detail on a
photograph. The texts are chosen to illustrate the development of Greek book hands
and cursive scripts; to examine formal aspects of the transmission of Greek
literature on papyrus; and to give an idea of the range of documentary types
available as sources for the history of Graeco-Roman Egypt.Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutor: Dr Antony
Makrinos Class hours: One
two-hour class per week, Term 1.  Assessment: One
piece of coursework of 2,500 words maximum (25%) and one unseen two-hour examination
paper (75%). The coursework is a critical analysis of one of the essay titles
provided; the exam involves commentaries and essays.Pre-requisites: Normally GREK 2006/2006A Greek Texts 1/1A or
equivalent. Content: The
course will focus on discussing Homer’s Iliad
in the original. Issues discussed will include the composition of oral poetry,
structure, plot and character, the idea of heroism, the theme of war, the role
of the gods, gender and social values, the reception of Homer in later ages. In
this course we will follow Achilles coming back to the war and mercilessly
killing the Trojans now that Hector has killed Achilles. We will follow the
duel between Achilles and Hector, the killing of Hector and the funeral games
for dead Patroclus. Finally we will examine Priam’s supplication of Achilles
for the body of Hector and our reading will end with Hector’s funeral.We will read the Greek text together (some parts
will be left for independent study). Areas to investigate will include the
nature of epic; the traditionality of Homer; the differences between oral and
written texts and the cultures that make them; the epic hero (Achilles, Hector);
fiction and truth; poetry and 'song'; ideas of war, space and time; gods and
goddesses; death and the afterlife; magic and religion; Homeric society and
ethics; men and women in epic; and the impact of the Iliad on the later tradition in poetry and art. We will aim to cover Books 21-24 of the
Iliad in the original Greek. We will use the Oxford
Classical Texts edition of T. Allen. Translation:
R. Lattimore, The Iliad of Homer, (Chicago
and London, 1951). Commentaries: G. S. Kirk, The Iliad: A Commentary, (Cambridge 1985-1993), esp. vol. 6 by N.
Richardson covering books 21-24, N. Postlethwaite, Homer’s Iliad: a
commentary on the translation of Richmond Lattimore (Exeter 2000). Companions: R. Fowler, The Cambridge Companion to Homer (Cambridge 2005); P. B.
Powell-I.Morris, A New Companion to Homer (Leiden 1997); Grammar:
D. B. Monro, Homeric Grammar (Bristol
Classical Press, 2013); Dictionary: G. Autenrieth, Homeric Dictionary,
(Duckworth, 1998). Recommended secondary readings: R.
Rutherford, Homer. Greece & Rome
New Surveys in the Classics (Cambridge 1996); A.B. Lord, The Singer of Tales (Harvard University
Press 1960; re-issued since); J. Griffin, Homer
on Life and Death, (Oxford 1980); B. Graziosi, Homer
(Oxford 2016); M. Mueller, The Iliad. Second edition
(London 2009); M. Silk, Homer: The Iliad (Cambridge 1987).Skills:
By
the end of the course, students will engage with
Homeric ideas as explored in the Iliad
and with their reception in secondary literature. In this way they will gain an
understanding of concepts and theories produced by the Homeric epics. They will
also concentrate on primary materials and develop the ability to read Homeric
Greek independently, to manage their own learning, to communicate ideas in
writing and to gather, present, analyze and synthesize data. Independent
thinking will also be strongly encouraged in order to enable student
development and achievement.Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutor: Dr Peter AgócsAssessment: An essay
of 6,000 words maximum (including footnotes
and excluding bibliography) on a subject related to one or more of the courses being
taken by the candidate in the Final-year. Content: After a
general meeting organised by the Ancient World Tutor, a preliminary title must
be submitted in writing to the Ancient World Tutor for approval, after which an
appropriate supervisor will be assigned. Students should arrange to meet their
supervisors at the end of the first term for an initial discussion, then again
at the beginning of the second term, to discuss abstract and bibliography,
followed by further meetings (normally about two) to discuss drafts over the
remainder of term 2. If students would like their supervisors to read any full
drafts, these should be submitted two weeks before the end of tem 2 at the
latest; availability of supervisors during the Easter vacation cannot be
guaranteed.Please note, all lists on this page are provisional. Module options and the details
 contained within each will be finalised as soon as possible. Compulsory modules and
standard language modules will be offered every year. The range of theme- and
author-based modules can vary from year to year, depending on staff
availability, and in the interest of a rich curriculum. A detailed list of
modules running in the coming academic year will normally be available in early
spring of the preceding year
    This is a call for proposals for a half-day
interdisciplinary workshop to be held on the afternoon of 21st February 2018 at UCL on the topic of ‘Rejecting the
Classics’, hosted by UCL’s Department of Greek and Latin and Institute of

Intermediate Latin B or Latin to A-level standard or equivalentContent:
This
module offers study of classical Latin language, involving the reading and
translation into English of prose and verse texts, exercises in grammatical
analysis and stylistic criticism, the translation of English sentences into
Latin, and the scansion of hexameter and elegiac verse. The course is designed
for those who already have a good A-level knowledge of the language or have
passed Intermediate Latin B. It prepares students for studying whole works in
the original language and therefore provides a step towards Latin Texts 2. The module consists of two
elements:(i) Reading of extended
sections of relatively straightforward texts of classical Latin prose and verse,
which are prepared in advance and worked through in detail in class. This will
include comment on style and grammar (two hours per with main tutor).(ii) The systematic study
and revision of the principles of Latin grammar syntax, which is practiced by translating
English into Latin (one hour per week with PGTA).Student will be expected
to have read the entire set texts by the end of the relevant term; a few pages
of Latin will have to be prepared every week.The module may be taken
as whole unit (two texts) or a half-unit (one text). Students taking the course
as a half-unit are expected to take it in the first term. Anyone starting the
course in the second term may do so only following advice from the Departmental
Tutor.Skills:
By
the end of the module, students should have a good knowledge of classical Latin
language, be trained to translate fluently from Latin into English and from
English into Latin and be able to analyze linguistic features of a text in
relation to its content.Course texts: Text term 1: K. Quinn

confident grasp of Latin grammar and syntax, and have completed satisfactorily
‘LATN 2008 Latin Texts 1’ or equivalent.Course descriptionThis course aims to enable students to
acquire the principles and techniques of writing Latin prose (translation from
English). We will use the text-book North and Hillard, Latin Prose
Composition (often reprinted, and available online on the moodle for this
course). To begin with, we will revise the more complex constructions of Latin
syntax, and translate sample sentences from English into Latin. After the first
few weeks, we will proceed to translating passages of around 200 words, and
eventually, we will move onto translating more extended passages of English
prose. Each week, for homework, students will be expected to translate
sentences or passages from English into Latin, and to revise their knowledge of
Latin accidence. In class, we will test the students’ knowledge of accidence,
go over the homework, and cover new topics in Latin syntax.  Skills:
Students will develop
their ability to express themselves in writing, to analyse sentence structures,
and to solve complex problems by applying extensive memorized information.Introductory reading: North and Hillard, Latin Prose

of Latin prose and poetry from the late Roman empire to the Middle Ages.  The course aims to
introduce students to a selection of late and Medieval Latin writings and to
equip them to appreciate basic linguistic characteristics as well as the
cultural and historical backgrounds of these texts. The linguistic element will concentrate on
pointing out some basic differences between Medieval Latin and Classical Latin;
students should be sufficiently proficient in Latin to appreciate these
differences and to translate the texts. Greater attention will be placed on introducing the historic and
cultural context of the texts and their authors on the assumption that students
will have a limited knowledge of the Middle Ages. Skills: Participants will develop the ability to
discriminate between different registers of a language and to follow its
evolution over time, as well as to relate literary and linguistic trends to
their cultural context.Course

course is designed for students in Comparative Literature and in Greek and
Latin.  There will be a mixture of ancient and non-ancient texts.
 All texts will be read in English, though parallel texts in the original
languages may also be supplied.

The texts that we shall read in this course are concerned with cultural
difference.  Each text was written by an individual in one culture, but
each deals with individuals or communities of another culture.  How does
one culture think about another culture, and what is at stake in cross-cultural
representation? What does the cross-cultural representation say about the
author’s own culture? What kind of identity and value do cultures impart to
other cultures? How do texts deal with the problem of cross-cultural
representation? We approach this set of questions through the literature of
travel. The themes that we shall consider include the figure of the traveller,
exoticism, ethnography, translation, tourism and colonialism.   Running
through these themes is a focus on the concept of the foreigner, and we shall
examine the foreigner as he/she/it appears in texts from different cultures and
periods.  What is a foreigner?  How was the idea of the foreigner
first proposed?  What are the consequences of this idea in the West?
 What do words such as “barbarian” or “savage” signify and how are they
related to the concept of the foreign?  We shall attempt to ascertain the
influence of these notions on Western thought and literature, and at the same
time we shall ask if there are non-Western ways of approaching the problem of
cultural difference. The course will
consider how the idea of the other is complicated by issues of gender,
sexuality, race, nation, and modernity.  We shall also examine the problem
for what it has to say to people such as ourselves who live in a multicultural
society.Readings

writings of Christopher Columbus; Shakespeare, The Tempest; and Claude Lévi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques.

Ionian physical enquiry to the Sophists. The course will initially provide a
background to early Greek philosophy, by considering its dialectical relation
to the intellectual and cultural milieu of Archaic Greece. Students will then
be introduced to the philosophical doctrines of a range of authors, including
Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Empedocles,
Anaxagoras, Democritus, Protagoras and Gorgias. By touching on matters of
physics (the study of nature and natural change), epistemology (the study of
knowledge) and ontology (the study of being), the course will help students
understand the origins of philosophical speculation and the fundamental questions
which informed the later development of the discipline.Skills: Students will learn methods of argument reconstruction,
approaches to critical analysis of texts, and how to approach fragmentary
sources successfully.Course texts: R. McKirahan (Hackett, 2011) Philosophy

Tutor: Dr Adam LecznarClass
hours: One
two-hour class per week, Term 1. Assessment: One piece of coursework of 2,500 words
maximum (40%) and one unseen three-hour examination paper (60%). The coursework
is a critical analysis of one of the essay titles provided; the exam involves
commentaries and essays.Pre-requisites: NoneContent: The course will focus on reading a
representative selection of ancient Greek comedies by Aristophanes and Menander
in translation. One or two plays will be read each week, along with one or two
articles or book chapters from the secondary literature. The aim is to
introduce students to the genre of ancient Greek comedy and enable to
understand it both in its historical context and as a timeless example of the
importance of comedy. Issues of content, political, religious and social
context, as well as comic convention and the evolution of the comic genre will
be discussed and analysed in class.   Skills:
By the end of the
module, the students should have learnt how to engage in close reading of the
texts and make effective use of secondary bibliography in order to analyse and
understand the content and context of Greek comedy. They should be able to read
the texts independently and present their conclusions in a coherent and
thoughtful manner both orally and in writing.  Introductory

course will focus on discussing Homer’s Iliad
in translation. Issues discussed will include the composition of oral poetry,
structure, plot and character, the idea of heroism, the theme of war, the role
of the gods, gender and social values, the reception of Homer in later ages. Skills: By the end
of the course, students will engage with classical
ideas as explored in the Iliad and
with their reception in secondary literature. In this way they will gain an
understanding of concepts and theories produced by these sources. They will
also concentrate on primary materials and develop the ability to read texts
independently, to manage their own learning, to communicate ideas orally and in
writing and to gather, present, analyze and synthesize data. Teamwork and
independent thinking will also be strongly encouraged in order to enable
student development and achievement.Introductory reading: J. Griffin, Homer (Oxford 1980); B. Graziosi, Homer

This
module will focus on reading and discussing primary sources in translation. The
texts will be taken partly from Michael Trapp’s anthology (see below) and
additional sources to be made available on Moodle. About six to eight letters
(or extracts of letters) will be read every week, along with one article or
book chapter form the secondary literature.The module will offer a
survey of the traditions and evolution of the epistolary genre, analysing
samples from Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Seneca the Younger, Pliny the Younger,
Fronto and elsewhere. For individual letters, issues such as characterisation,
rhetorical strategy, imagery, humour, manipulation and emotional response
(whether of the original addressee or the wider audience) will be considered.The surviving body of
letters form the ancient world is extraordinarily rich and diverse. From
official imperial correspondence to fictionalised letters embedded in larger
works (particularly historiographical narratives and novels), letters, whether
real or invented, can in different ways inform, teach, entertain, and shock.
The genre is remarkably flexible, incorporating pieces written in prose or
verse, and in Latin or Greek. As the boundaries of the Greco-Roman world
expanded under the empire, individuals found that they needed to communicate
over considerable distances, and the ‘epistolary habit’ really came into its own.
The ubiquitous presence of letters in real life (even pieces faked for the
purposes of propaganda) in turn guaranteed a receptive audience for literary
letters.Skills:
By
the end of the module, students should be trained in close reading, analysis of
form, content and context, and the ability to present written and oral
conclusions about a complex body of data in a coherent fashion.Introductory

students taking Ancient World.  Content: This survey
course builds on the first-year courses Interpreting Latin Literature and
Interpreting Greek Literature and is designed to provide a general critical
background to the author and theme-based literature courses taught both in the
original language and in translation. The course will analyse ways in which a
range of modern critical techniques (including reception theory, feminist
criticism, structuralism, post-colonialism) can enhance our reading of Greek
and Latin texts. Emphasis will placed be on the relationship between these
different approaches and a specific selection of texts across a range of Greek
and Roman authors, periods and genres.Value: 0.5 course units

week, Term 2.  Assessment: One
piece of coursework of 2,500 words maximum (40%) and one unseen three-hour examination
paper (60%)Pre-requisites: None Content: This
course, taught in English translation, examines the work of the Classical Greek
prose writer Xenophon in cultural, political and literary context. An Athenian
writer, Xenophon travelled widely across the Greek world and Asia Minor, and
wrote about his experiences with different cultures, both Greek and non-Greek.
His texts discuss controversial issues of his day – conflict between Greeks,
Spartan society and power, Persian imperialism, relations with foreign lands,
and citizenly behaviour in Athens. Unlike most writers from his period, he
wrote across a wide range of genres, such as history, philosophical dialogue
and rhetoric, as well introducing new forms such as travel writing, biography
and the novel. The course will examine a range of his texts, considering the
relationship between cultural representation, politics and literary form, and
addressing questions of Greek identity, concepts of Otherness, power relations
and class consciousness in the context of the development of Classical Greek
prose writing. Skills:
Students will develop their awareness of critical approaches to texts, their
understanding of the relations between form, content and context, and their
ability in close reading and in oral and written analysis.Introductory

week, Term 2.  Assessment: Continuous assessment (100%), based on two
pieces of coursework of 2,500 words maximum each (50% each).Pre-requisites: NoneContent: This
course offers an introduction to Plato's philosophical dialogues, with a
particular focus on the early and middle works, including the Republic. It considers both the
philosophical and the literary aspects of the dialogues and the fundamental ways
in which these coincide. Covering a range of dialogues including the Euthyphro, Gorgias, Meno, Phaedo, Symposium and Republic,
the course touches on questions of ethics, metaphysics, epistemology and
Socratic and Platonic philosophy generally.  Skills: At the end of the course, students should be able to give
an account of Plato’s discussion of specific philosophical issues; give an
account of Plato’s literary and dramatic technique; discuss the relation
between different dialogues and indicate its possible significance.Preparatory

one-hour classes per week, Term 2.  Assessment: one
piece of coursework of 2,500 words maximum (40%), one unseen three-hour examination
paper (60%) Pre-requisites: none Content: This course is an exploration of epic poetry.
 The focus is on the relationship between literary epic
and political ideology.  How do epic poems relate to
authority?  How do the romance and imperial traditions coexist in
poetry?  How does political patronage overlap with
literary patronage?  And more generally, what is the
relationship between politics and literature?  We shall pay attention to
the social and historical contexts in which epic poems took shape and
circulated.  We shall also be concerned with questions of
gender, religion, identity, transmission, and literary form.  The
course will consider work from different cultural traditions.
 All texts will be read in translation.   Readings may include the following: Homer, Iliad and Odyssey; Virgil,
Aeneid; Derek Walcott, Omeros. N.B This course is designed for final year students. Second-year students may only take it with
the special permission of the Departmental Tutor.Value: 0.5 course unitsCourse Tutor: Dr Peter AgócsAssessment: An essay
of 6,000 words maximum (including footnotes
and excluding bibliography) on a subject related to one or more of the courses being
taken by the candidate in the Final-year. Content: After a
general meeting organised by the Ancient World Tutor, a preliminary title must
be submitted in writing to the Ancient World Tutor for approval, after which an
appropriate supervisor will be assigned. Students should arrange to meet their
supervisors at the end of the first term for an initial discussion, then again
at the beginning of the second term, to discuss abstract and bibliography,
followed by further meetings (normally about two) to discuss drafts over the
remainder of term 2. If students would like their supervisors to read any full
drafts, these should be submitted two weeks before the end of tem 2 at the
latest; availability of supervisors during the Easter vacation cannot be
guaranteed.Notes:  Students who are
writing primarily about Greek texts in the original may choose to take GREK3005
ESSAY ON APPROVED SUBJECT (GREEK) rather than CLAS3901; students who are
writing primarily about Latin texts in the original may choose to take LATN3007
ESSAY ON APPROVED SUBJECT (LATIN) rather than CLAS3901. If you are in
doubt about which course you should choose, please contact the Ancient World
Tutor for advice.Please note, all lists on this page are provisional. Module options and the details
 contained within each will be finalised as soon as possible.Compulsory modules and
standard language modules will be offered every year. The range of theme- and
author-based modules can vary from year to year, depending on staff
availability, and in the interest of a rich curriculum. A detailed list of
modules running in the coming academic year will normally be available in early
spring of the preceding year.

academic requirements during the Year Abroad for students who began their
degrees in 2015/16 and earlier, and for students beginning their degrees in
2016/17. The differences will be noted where relevant below. a) These degrees have the same rules as
three-year Classics and Ancient World degrees (respectively) in Year 1, Year 2
and Year 4 (where the rules for Year 3 of three-year degrees apply), except
that, in Years 1 and 2, candidates must study at the appropriate level the
language of the country they intend to visit in Year 3. b) Progression to Year 3 Study/Year Abroad is subject to satisfactory
performance in Years 1 and 2 (i.e. requirements for progression must be met).
Additionally, students must have completed the ‘Preparation for Study Abroad
Programme’ in the spring of Year 2. c)
Candidates who began their degrees in 2015/16 or earlier must take CLAS3902
Year Abroad Dissertation (1 unit) and 2 ‘shell-course units’ in Year  d)
For these candidates, progression to Year 4 is conditional on completion and
passing of CLAS3902 and on the completion of the 2 ‘shell-course units’. Candidates
beginning their degrees in 2016/17 must take 2 ‘shell-course units’ in Year 3.
For these candidates, progression to Year 4 is conditional on the completion of
the 2 ‘shell-course units’. e)
For candidates who began their degrees in 2015/16 or earlier, assessment of the
degree as a whole is as for the 3-Year Classics and Ancient World Degrees,
except that CLAS3902 counts as fifth Year 4 unit. For
candidates beginning their degrees in 2016/17, assessment of the degree as a
whole is as for the 3-Year Classics and Ancient World Degrees. f) Candidates who
have not previously studied the modern language of the country they intend to
visit must complete at least 1.5 course units of this language during Years 1
and 2 (i.e. 1.5 course units across the two years, not 1.5 course units each
year) or provide satisfactory documentation of an
equivalent engagement with this language outside of the UCL course units at the
end of each academic year (e.g. via external language classes or tutoring).g) Candidates who
have a GCSE or A-Level in the modern language of the country they intend to
visit must complete at least 1 unit of this language during Years 1 and 2 (with
at least 0.5 course units in Year 2) or provide
satisfactory documentation of an equivalent engagement with this language
outside of the UCL course units at the end of each academic year (e.g. via
external language classes or tutoring). Exceptionally, by
the permission of the Year Abroad Tutor this requirement
can be reduced to 0.5 course units in Year 2 (or equivalent) for those who have
an A-Level (or equivalent).h) Subject to the approval of their Degree Tutor, candidates may be
permitted to take 1 course unit of the language (or literature taught in the
original language) of their Year 3 Host country at an appropriate level in Year
4 (in addition to selection of modules outside the Classics/Ancient World field
of study permitted under the degree rules).These rules refer to the GREEK AND LATIN side of your degree:CLAS1301 Introduction to

Latin/Classics with Study Abroad/Joint Degrees with Latin students. Ancient
World students may be admitted subject to the permission of the Departmental
Tutor. Content: This course
will focus on reading and discussing primary sources in translation and it is a
broad-sweep survey of Roman literature, covering the principal authors
and genres and starting from the beginnings of early Latin literature, through
the Republican period and into early Imperial Rome. This course is intended as
an introduction to Latin literature and theoretical approaches to literature,
and it aims to provide students with a chronological and thematic framework for
further study of ancient Latin literature. Topics will include the Roman
theatre; satire; Roman epic and challenges to epic; historiography; lyric and
love poetry; declamation and oratory; and the birth of the novel. Twice weekly classes take as a starting point selected readings from major

The Ancient World degree is one of the most flexible 
degree programmes covering the Ancient World in the UK. A range of 
options is offered from across three departments:  The field of study of the degree is also defined more 
broadly than most degrees in this area: the ancient world of the 
Mediterranean and Near East, since the beginning of written records. It 
is possible to take courses relating to this field from any of the three
 participating departments. It is also possible to take a number of 
“elective” courses on any subject from across the university: students 
often use this option to study a modern language, the archaeology or 
history of a different period or place, or any other subject they are 
interested in (art history, anthropology, English literature, etc). The degree is open to those who have no previous experience of Latin or Greek languages, but all students must take one and a half units in an ancient language
 during their degree. This is because we believe that the cultures of 
the ancient world can best be appreciated through exposure to ancient 
languages, as well as to their literature, history, and archaeology. All
 students are given the opportunity to reach intermediate level in at 
least one ancient language, and to experience the diverse approaches to 
the ancient world offered by the different disciplines of history, 
archaeology and literary studies. The first year core course Approaches to the Ancient World
 is intended to introduce the methodologies of these different 
disciplines. The final year Extended Essay, involving independent study 
of a topic chosen by you, is the culmination of the degree. The breadth and variety of the degree means that you can 
make of it what you will. In the first year, students must study the 
full range of disciplines offered by the degree (Classical 
language/literature, ancient history, archaeology). Beyond the first 
year, it is largely up to you how you structure your degree. Many students enjoy taking the full range of disciplines 
across their three years. Others prefer to concentrate on one 
discipline.  Your first year is the time to experiment and find out 
where your 
interests lie. You should talk over your course choices with your 
Personal Tutor, and of course you are always most welcome to contact the
 Ancient World Degree Tutor if you have any questions or 
concerns. Professor Phiroze VasuniaAll staff at UCL (Ancient World)

For the Classics (Q800) degree programme, which requires students to have
an A-level (or equivalent) in Latin or Ancient Greek, students must take at
least one unit of Latin-based
courses, and at least one unit of Greek-based courses.
In addition, there are some compulsory core-courses in the first and second
years involving texts
in translation. The structure for Classics with Year Abroad (Q801) is
identical, except that students spend their third year abroad, and have their
final year at UCL in their fourth year. This gives the following structure: Classics - Sample One This student arrived at UCL with A levels in Latin and Greek. In his first year
he took Latin Texts I as his compulsory unit of Latin language, and Greek Texts
I as his compulsory unit of Greek language. He progressed from Latin Texts I in
his first year, to Latin Texts II in his second, to a prescribed text course in
his final year, in which he also took a number of other high-level Latin
courses. In Greek, he followed a similar progressions: from Greek Texts I in
his first year, to Greek Texts II in his second, to a high-level Greek course (Homer)
in his final year. Like all classicists, he took the core literature survey
courses Interpreting Greek Literature and Interpreting Latin Literature in the
first year, and the Classics and Literary Theory course in the second. As his
interests were very much in the field of classical languages and literature,
almost all his course choices were courses offered by the Department of Greek
and Latin. Classics - Sample Two This student came to UCL with Latin GCE A level, and no prior knowledge of
Greek. In her first year, she took Latin Texts I as her compulsory unit of
Latin language, progressing to Latin Texts II in her second year and to a
prescribed text in her third year. In Greek, she progressed from Greek for
Beginners in her first year, to Intermediate Greek in the second, to Greek
Texts I in her final year. Like all classicists, she took the core literature
survey courses Interpreting Greek Literature and Interpreting Latin Literature
in the first year, and the Classics and Literary Theory course in the second.
This student was also able to pursue her interest in art, taking two courses
outside the Classical World syllabus in her first and second years, and also to
cultivate interests in archaeology and history.

Antony Makrinos and PhD student Kyriaki Ioannidou staged a special reading of Amphitruo, Plautus' classic tragi-comedy of love and deceit.This staged class was part of an idea to introduce innovative ways of teaching Latin (and specifically Roman Comedy) to undergraduate students of the Greek and Latin Department, UCL. The course was Latin Texts 2, Plautus: Amphitruo (LATN 3008/3008A). The aims of the class were to live the experience of teaching Latin as an educator-performer and to explore the educational benefits of this experience and its reception by the students.The class included a live performance of the last scene of Plautus' play Amphitruo by the teacher and a PhD student with the use of masks and a discussion of the practices used. The text was adapted to suit the needs of the class. Both the text and the lecture notes can be found below:The masks for Jupiter and Alcumena.Alcumena's husband AmphitruoAntony’s and Kyriaki’s thoughts about the class will be presented in the Arts and Humanities conference 2013 Storyville: Exploring narratives of learning and teaching, organised by the Higher Education Academy, (Brighton, 29-30 May 2013).

Antony Makrinos with the help of PhD students Danae Bafa and Tzu-I Liao presented a special class for Greek for Beginners in the Petrie Museum. This class was part of an idea to introduce innovative ways of teaching Greek to undergraduate students of the Greek and Latin Department, UCL for the course Greek for Beginners A, term 1 (GREK1001).The aims of the class were to engage and motivate students in their learning of Greek and communicate the idea that students from the Beginners class are able to understand the general meaning of short passages or inscriptions in Greek. The purpose of the class was to explore the benefits of an educational experience in which students come into contact with material culture which challenges the perception of Greek as a “dead language”.The class included the presentation of 10 ancient objects by the tutor with the collaboration of a curator from the museum and a PhD student and a discussion with the students about the identification of the objects and the translation of Greek inscriptions on them with the help of the grammar and syntax learnt during the course.A list of the objects presented can be found below:1. 58267            ring                  IC XC ΑΓΕ2. 59254           Dice                  Numbers3. 59255           Dice                  Numbers4. 59434           Mummy label     ΩΡΟΣ ΕΤΩΝ Δ5. 59498           stamp seal         BACΙΛΕ6. 32088           ostracon            Letters exercise7. 45647           mummy label     Pangarsis son of Kolanthos who lived 60 years8. 45639           mummy label     Sisois son of old Sisois his mother…9.a.

Antony Makrinos with the help of PhD students Emily Lord-Kambitsch and Bridget England presented a special class for Latin for Beginners in the Wellcome Library. This class was part of innovative practice in teaching Latin for Beginners to a group of 27 undergraduate students for the course Latin for Beginners B (LATN1003). The aims of the class were to teach Latin texts for Beginners and their translation through the study of manuscripts and early editions from the Wellcome Trust collections. Additionally, the tutor also aimed to explore the benefits of such an experience for the students in an educational environment outside the classroom.The class will be presented at the conference "Heroes and Monsters: extra-ordinary tales of learning and teaching in the arts and humanities", organised by the Higher Education Academy (Manchester, 2-4 June 2014). A shared talk will be delivered by the tutor, Antony Makrinos and one of the Teaching Assistants, Emily Lord-Kambitsch with the title: “Sing me Winged Muse: teaching Latin and the ‘monstrous’ wonders of the Aeneid" (http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/arts-humanities-conf-2014). The talk will introduce innovative pedagogies and methodologies for the teaching of ancient languages through early editions and manuscripts and it will invite dialogue between the delegates about this teaching practice.Student Feedback- "It was incredibly useful and satisfying to apply knowledge about Latin to actual historical texts. It brought Latin to life in a way that no textbook or Powerpoint could…"- "Very helpful - it gave context to what we have learned."- "The images increase the level of emotional engagement by making the themes explored more vivid."- "I appreciated the PP as one could see texts very closely and in great clarity. It was amazing seeing the manuscripts in real life..."- "It was very useful as I was now able to put our learning into practice!"Many thanks to:- Dr Elma Brenner (Specialist, Medieval and Early Modern Medicine Wellcome Library) for working so hard in order to book the rooms for us and for useful guidance with the editions.- Emily Lord-Kambitsch and Bridget England for their enthusiasm, their patience and their professionalism in helping with the teaching of this class.

				    Department of Greek & Latin
 28-29 June 2017 in the Department of Greek
and Latin, Teaching Fellow Emily Chow-Kambitsch and undergraduate Greek and
Latin students Hansy Shore, Abhilash Sivaraman, and Caterina Domeneghini ran
UCL’s first Living Latin Workshop. This workshop was generously supported by
UCL ChangeMakers and UCL Greek and Latin, and offered participants an
exploration of various pedagogical methods for approaching Latin as a living
language. 
This project aimed to provide a foundation
for Latin students and enthusiasts across disciplines to cultivate a new mode
of connection with their curriculum: an active engagement with Latin language
that can foster development of linguistic skills, and can allow for a more
nuanced understanding of the language’s relationship to aspects of ancient
Roman cultural identity. The workshop encouraged students to bridge study of
ancient cultures with contemporary cultural experience by communicating their
own ideas in Latin, which is usually taught through comparatively passive
absorption of set texts for translation into English. The workshop attracted 20 participants from
a variety of backgrounds: academics, students, schoolteachers, and several
retirees who had come back to studies in Latin very recently. Motivations for
attending the workshop cited on our feedback questionnaire included: ‘To
improve my level of Latin, and engage more with the language’; ‘To see if
“Living Latin” can provide more exciting ways of teaching Latin’; and ‘I think
it is very important to promote active fluency in Latin in order to improve the
standards of language knowledge across the board (students & teachers)’. It
was a great benefit for us to welcome such a diverse audience, as it allowed us
to have rich discussions about conventional Latin teaching methods, and the
potential for the growth of immersive initiatives in formal and informal
pedagogical settings.  This two-day immersive workshop combined
elements of Latin composition and conversation, and discussion in English:
evaluating immersive Latin currently used in teaching and research; writing
dialogues on varied themes; applying Latin speaking skills to cooperative
games; and discussing short passages of Latin literature in Latin. Participants
were thus provided with a foundational set of immersive methods for enhancing
their grammar and translation skills and enriching their insight into the Roman
cultural perspective. Our Latinists hard at work!Before we introduced our series of
activities in using Latin as a living
language, we emphasized that our main objective was not to achieve perfect pronunciation, perfect grammatical
constructions, or perfect precision in vocabulary usage. Rather, our goal was
to experiment with generating our own ideas and utterances in Latin, and to
discuss the pedagogical tools that best aid this process. Indeed, throughout
the course of the workshop, participants were eager to speak to the benefits,
challenges, and ethics (is it cultural misappropriation? Should we use
neologisms and otherwise attempt to discuss modern inventions, cultural
phenomena in Latin?) embodied in the active use of Latin today.The workshop began with the organizers introducing
the current state of play and exciting new developments in Living Latin
initiatives worldwide. We provided participants with an informational handout
on current Latin speaking schools, podcasts, and workshops taking place around
the world, and gave some web demonstrations of particularly interesting
examples, such as the Quomodo Dicitur?
Podcast, whose hosts discuss a range of subjects in academia, current
events, and popular culture entirely in Latin! Emily
and Abhilash discussing current Living Latin activities and organisations The exercises progressed from pronunciation
and recitation exercises to short oral conversation and written composition
activities, in order to encourage participants to explore incrementally their
skills in active use of Latin. Here is a sampling of some of the activities:Conversation time: the "stations exercise"
‘Dining out’ exercise from
conversation stations: participants role-play ordering ancient Roman dishes!We were very fortunate to have two guest
speakers join us throughout the course of the workshop.Dr. Pauline Souleau, a lecturer in French
at the University of Oxford, spoke to us about the challenges of teaching
conversation in modern language, and shared the importance of structuring a
language course that prioritizes speaking and listening skills for the sake of
understanding the consequential transformations of grammar and vocabulary from
the written to the oral form of a language. Dr. Souleau’s lecture initiated a
lively discussion that addressed questions of conventional methods in Latin
language teaching, and distinctions between the register of Latin we are used
to seeing in classical literature versus the register we should aim for when
speaking Latin. The conversation expanded to encompass the broader aims of
Latin pedagogy: should we treat Latin sentences as codes to be broken? To what
extent can the structure of the language itself provide insight into the
culture? To what extent can and should active use of the language be perceived
as a benefit to understanding the Ancient Roman world?A. Gratius
Avitus, a fluent Latin speaker and founder of the Circulus Latinus Londiniensis
(London Latin Circle), addressed the participants for one hour in Latin, introducing them to a range of
resources, organizations and events which teach and explore uses of Latin as a
living language. Videos of Living Latin communities in action demonstrated
remarkable variation in individual speaking styles (accents, pronunciation,
inflection, and idiosyncracies in vocabulary), and exhibited each speaker’s
unique ability to bring the language to life. Avitus’ talk was eye-opening for
participants, some of whom were astonished at the amount of content they could
readily understand, even if it had been years or decades since they had
encountered formal instruction in Latin. Avitus also led
a highly stimulating short literary seminar, where participants read and
discussed (in Latin) the opening of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Vita Merlini (style, themes, and noteworthy areas of engagement
with textual precedents in classical Latin, especially in the epic tradition).
Avitus was an excellent facilitator, encouraging participants to offer
responses to his questions in as much depth and completeness as they were
comfortable providing. This activity showed particular potential for further
development either in extended sessions in further workshops, or in a regularly
meeting Latin conversation group setting, ideally with the facilitation of an
experienced Latin speaker.

Avitus explaining a literary
passage entirely in Latin!We were very impressed by the level of
fluency the participants gained over the course of two days. The transformation
between the participants’ rather hesitant introductions on Day One and the much
more confident full sentences generated during the game of ‘Versipellis’ on Day
Two was wonderful to witness.We benefited significantly from having an
experienced Latin speaker present throughout the workshop. Avitus’ help,
patience, guidance, and mentorship were a great part of what made the day a
success, and participant feedback suggests that this was an important factor in
aiding their confidence in developing written and oral composition skills.The activities were generally
well-structured so that people with various levels of Latin proficiency could
participate equally, and could challenge themselves in accordance with their
experience and comfort levels.The workshop received overwhelmingly
positive feedback, with half of the 14 respondents writing on their feedback
forms that they are ‘very likely’ to continue exploring immersive methods, and
9 participants designating that they ‘strongly agree’ with the statement that
immersive methods are of use to Latin pedagogy.Many participants described the ways in
which their ideas about ‘Living Latin’ had changed as a result of attending the
workshop: We hope that following the success of this
workshop at UCL Greek and Latin we can run similar workshops, a Latin
conversation group, or other related activities in Living Latin at UCL, and
perhaps in collaboration with existing Living Latin initiatives in the UK and
further afield. We have witnessed in a very short period of time the great
potential for the pedagogical methods in the active use of Latin to raise
students’ confidence, enthusiasm, and proficiency in language skills. When
students are invited to approach Latin on their own terms, they have a personal
stake in mastering grammar concepts and acquiring vocabulary, and when they
engage in dialogue on ancient literature in the original language, they carve
new interpretative channels that might reflect a greater sensitivity to the
cultural perspective found in the language itself.We thank UCL ChangeMakers and UCL Greek and
Latin for helping to make this event a wonderful success, and we look forward
to seeing its legacy grow and flourish!Note: Watch this page for videos of the
workshop to be added!

Antony Makrinos and PhD student Kyriaki Ioannidou staged a special reading of Amphitruo, Plautus' classic tragi-comedy of love and deceit.This staged class was part of an idea to introduce innovative ways of teaching Latin (and specifically Roman Comedy) to undergraduate students of the Greek and Latin Department, UCL. The course was Latin Texts 2, Plautus: Amphitruo (LATN 3008/3008A). The aims of the class were to live the experience of teaching Latin as an educator-performer and to explore the educational benefits of this experience and its reception by the students.The class included a live performance of the last scene of Plautus' play Amphitruo by the teacher and a PhD student with the use of masks and a discussion of the practices used. The text was adapted to suit the needs of the class. Both the text and the lecture notes can be found below:The masks for Jupiter and Alcumena.Alcumena's husband AmphitruoAntony’s and Kyriaki’s thoughts about the class will be presented in the Arts and Humanities conference 2013 Storyville: Exploring narratives of learning and teaching, organised by the Higher Education Academy, (Brighton, 29-30 May 2013). A shared talk will be presented with the title: “Teaching Latin: teaching experience as part of theatrical performance”. Details >>The talk will introduce innovative pedagogies and methodologies for the teaching of ancient languages used in the Department of Greek and Latin, UCL. The session will invite dialogue between the delegates about the creative teaching of languages through staged classes, and it is hoped that this will stimulate interest in this way of teaching. Particular emphasis will be given to methodologies which enhance the teaching experience and help students digest aspects of the language. Interest is anticipated from teachers in the Humanities willing to use original techniques to make teaching engaging. Delegates will experience the class second hand (through videos) and will have hands on the props.Many thanks to:- Viv Sendall (Visiting Tutor in Scenic Art) for working so hard with the masks and for providing advice on how to use them; Andy Stead (Senior Lecturer), Gussie Dennet, Lydia Duncombe and Bianca Paule, (second year students on the Creative Arts for Theatre and Film course) UCA Rochester for producing the wonderful masks;- Kyriaki Ioannidou for her patience and her enthusiasm for the staged class and of course for her stunning performance as Bromi-Amphitruo;- Matthew Milner for his wonderful sound effects with the thunderbolts;- and Anastasia Papamichael for recording the class.

7-9 February 2018 at the Shaw Theatre, London NW1 2AJTickets not yet on sale.The UCL Classical Drama Society and the Department of Greek and Latin each year present a classical play in English translation in UCL's own theatre, the UCL Bloomsbury. The play takes place in February each year (about the same time as the ancient Athenian dramatic festival known as the Lenaia). This is now one of the most famous and long-running commitments to the modern production of ancient drama in the world. It attracts large audiences, many of whom are young people studying classical drama at school or university, and is regularly reviewed in the national press. Ticket prices are kept low. The production is managed by students in the Department of Greek and Latin, with help and advice from staff. A number of former students involved in the classical play have gone on to careers in drama. Students choose a director and a producer in the autumn: the title of the play for the following year is announced in late October (and will be posted on this website).The Department of Greek and Latin is committed to bringing these productions to the widest possible audience. For each production we run a programme of lectures and workshops, free and open to the public, which are run by leading academics and theatre experts from across the UK. For the benefit of schools and colleges we also create a web-page of study materials on ancient drama in general, and with special focus on the current year's performance. The students also maintain a blog on the play as they rehearse.

In a special session of the Roman
Epic (CLAS7109) course on 6 February 2015, the students observed a live performance
of the contest between two principal characters from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, impersonated by the
course instructors—the goddess Athena (Antony Makrinos) and her insubordinate
apprentice Arachne (Emily Lord-Kambitsch).Dr. Makrinos produced an
arrangement of A.D. Melville’s 2008 translation of the Ovid passage in order to
create a stronger impression of a dialogue between Athena and Arachne during
the weaving of their respective stories on the loom. These stories were
represented for the class in the form of a PowerPoint presentation featuring
paintings of the scenes woven in Ovid’s poem.  Athena addresses Arachne’s insubordinationThe Weaving contest The performance was followed by a
close reading of the text, accompanied by the construction of a spidergram on
the board representing various themes the course instructors and students
highlighted in the course of the discussion (including transformation, artist
as the epic heroine, the cultural function of art, the significance of weaving,
and the definition of immortality). By employing this performance and incorporating
the subsequent discussion, the teachers aimed to explore the impact of this
method as a ‘living spidergram’, an immersive, performative, and experiential
means of exploring connections between the greater themes of the course (such
as the relationship between gods and mortals in epic poetry, the voice of the
individual poet within the epic tradition) through an interactive engagement
with a specific text.The students’ impressions of this
session provide an initial understanding of the benefits of this type of
teaching and the opportunities it offers undergraduates to encounter and interpret
a text, and its role within the course in a new way. ‘I think the class worked really well. Firstly, you have the
surprising element of an unexpected performance which is surely very memorable
to the class. Secondly, I liked the idea of the web on the board as it is
related to the overall topic of spider/weaving/writing poetry as weaving
(deducere carmen) and the supportive images you presented on Powerpoint...That
creates a coherent theme that runs through the lesson.’‘I thought it was great that you both wanted to surprise us and
using different teaching methods (at least in my opinion) is a great way to
keep us on our toes!’‘I probably will
never forget the performance, which will help me when I have to prepare for my
final exams. It was a graphic way to explain the myth of Arachne and to
remember with more detail the characteristics of Ovid and the Metamorphoses.’ ‘Through the representation we could talk during the
remaining lesson about the story, drawing different ideas and its main themes,
so, after having not just read, but visualized, it was easier for us.’ Students also delivered some helpful feedback for improvement and
future directions for this teaching approach that will emphasise the connection
between the performance and the discussion.‘I
think it is important that the sheet and the web on the board are well
coordinated with each other. Perhaps you could ask the students after the
performance what they found conspicuous/what became evident in acting and not
in a mere reading of the text. This could then lead the way to a discussion of
the text's structure/characters/points on the notesheet.’Athena versus ArachneAntony Makrinos and Emily
Lord-Kambitsch will present a paper at the CALT Learning and Teaching
Conference, Monday 13 April, entitled ‘Athena versus Arachne: Experiential
Learning, and Teaching through Performance’. This paper will look at the case
study of this session in order to discuss the use of performance in the
classroom to create an experiential learning environment for students to engage
with a curriculum in a holistic way, with consideration for the greater aims of
the course.

Antony Makrinos with the help of PhD students Danae Bafa and Tzu-I Liao presented a special class for Greek for Beginners in the Petrie Museum. This class was part of an idea to introduce innovative ways of teaching Greek to undergraduate students of the Greek and Latin Department, UCL for the course Greek for Beginners A, term 1 (GREK1001).The aims of the class were to engage and motivate students in their learning of Greek and communicate the idea that students from the Beginners class are able to understand the general meaning of short passages or inscriptions in Greek. The purpose of the class was to explore the benefits of an educational experience in which students come into contact with material culture which challenges the perception of Greek as a “dead language”.The class included the presentation of 10 ancient objects by the tutor with the collaboration of a curator from the museum and a PhD student and a discussion with the students about the identification of the objects and the translation of Greek inscriptions on them with the help of the grammar and syntax learnt during the course.A list of the objects presented can be found below:1. 58267            ring                  IC XC ΑΓΕ2. 59254           Dice                  Numbers3. 59255           Dice                  Numbers4. 59434           Mummy label     ΩΡΟΣ ΕΤΩΝ Δ5. 59498           stamp seal         BACΙΛΕ6. 32088           ostracon            Letters exercise7. 45647           mummy label     Pangarsis son of Kolanthos who lived 60 years8. 45639           mummy label     Sisois son of old Sisois his mother…9.a.

A shared talk will be presented with the title: “When Dicaeopolis met Petrie: teaching Greek in UCL Museums”. The talk will introduce innovative pedagogies and methodologies for the teaching of ancient languages used in the Department of Greek and Latin, UCL. The session will invite dialogue between the delegates about the creative teaching of languages through visits to museums, and it is hoped that this will stimulate interest in this method of teaching. Particular emphasis will be given to methodologies which enhance the teaching experience and help students digest aspects of the Greek language. Delegates will experience the feedback of the students through videos and will get to ask questions about the class.Student Feedback- "Museum visit was a good idea for putting language into context…"- "Nice idea to have ‘fun’ Christmas lesson in the museum!"- "…Resources provided have been very useful."- "The trip to the Petrie Museum was a really fitting way to end the term: After the shock to the system that comes when first studying Greek, and a term of hard work, it was great to get to see and handle artefacts which we could actually decipher! A very effective - and appreciated - way to foster student interest."Many thanks to:- Tracie Golding (Visitor Services Officer in the Petrie Museum) for working so hard in order to book the rooms and provide the objects for us and for advising on how to handle and study them;- the curators and the technicians of the Petrie Museum for demonstrating the new application Tour of the Nile and for encouraging the students to use it with their i-pads and with images of the 3D scanned objects.- Danae Bafa for her enthusiasm, her expert advice for the class and her quick and efficient selection of papyri and other materials to show to the students.- Tzu-I Liao for helping with the teaching of the class.
