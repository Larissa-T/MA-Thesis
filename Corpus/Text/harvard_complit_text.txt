	Although we are here to answer your questions, it is helpful to first acquaint yourself with the following sources of information. A good place to start is the Comparative Literature program description at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. General information about financial aid can be found at www.gsas.harvard.edu/prospective_students/financial_aid.php. See our Q&A below for information on the department's financial aid, offered to all admitted students.Locating courses that are offered can be a good way to check out which faculty are teaching what courses and if your research interests would be met in our program.

	You may apply for admission on-line or request an application packet from https://gsas.harvard.edu/admissions/apply.And finally, there is a Q&A section (below) of questions most often asked that may provide added information. Happy researching!.General Guidelines for Admissions: The following is a set of general guidelines for the Department of Comparative Literature’s graduate admissions process. While several areas are emphasized here, the Admissions Committee carefully examines the overall profile of each applicant, taking these and other aspects of the candidate's application into consideration.The Application: Requests for applications and inquiries about financial aid should be addressed to www.gsas.harvard.edu. The application can be filled out on-line at the same address. You should make every effort to ensure that all supporting materials (transcripts, recommendations) arrive by the application deadline. No applications for admission will be accepted after the deadline set by GSAS.The Writing Sample: The writing sample is supposed to demonstrate your ability to engage in literary criticism and/or theory. It can be a paper written for a course or a section of a senior thesis or essay. It is usually between 10-20 pages. Do not send longer papers with instructions to read an excerpt; you should edit the sample so that it is no longer than 20 pages.  Writing samples should be in English, although candidates are permitted to submit an additional writing sample written in a different language.Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose should give the admissions committee a clear sense of your individual interests and strengths. You need not indicate at the time of application precisely what your field of specialization will be, but it is helpful to tell us about your aspirations and how the Comparative Literature department at Harvard might help in attaining these goals. These statements are usually between one and four pages long.Recommendations: It is important to have strong letters of recommendation from professors who are familiar with your academic work. An applicant who has been out of school for several years should try to reestablish contact with former professors. Additional letters from employers may also be included.Subject and program number: Our Harvard GSAS subject and program number is 1700 - this number is for use on the Harvard application.  

	Graduate Record Examination (GRE) codes: GRE scores should be reported to Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Code 3451.For more information on our graduate program, please contact our Director of Graduate Studies, Professor Verena Conley (vconley@fas.harvard.edu)

	The best place to start is with the admissions website: www.gsas.harvard.edu (which also contains the link for the Comparative Literature program description) and with the course catalogue at https://courses.my.harvard.edu/. This gives you an idea of who is teaching what and whether your interests are well represented at Harvard. This also gives you the foundation from which to ask specific questions.
While a high score in the verbal part of the test is a positive addition to the application, it is by no means the most important aspect of a candidacy. You should plan to take the GRE as early as possible and it should not be taken later than October in order to ensure arrival of scores as part of the application. December exam results can arrive too late to be considered. We do not require a GRE subject test.We do not ask for GPA but your overall grades do play an important role in the application process.We pay careful attention in evaluating prospective applicants to make sure that they would be able to satisfy our program requirements in a reasonable span of time. Our program requires declaring four languages, with coursework in three of them (one of which may be English). Most students we admit have a solid grounding in two literatures and languages and have had exposure to another (or more). Our program allows time for further language study as well. It is important for your application to give a clear idea of what level of language preparation you have. For instance, languages listedNo. You can take a master’s degree only if you are enrolled at Harvard College as an undergraduate. The only way to enter Comparative Literature is through the Ph.D. program, although once you are enrolled in our program you may take the A.M. degree in passing.Because we have over a hundred applicants annually and far more requests that do not result in applications, we tend to economize on the time of our students, who are the centerpiece and raison d’être of the whole program, by not involving them officially until after students have been admitted, at which point we put candidates in touch with students who have similar interests. Before then, potential applicants are welcome to contact students whom they know, but we do not connect applicants with students ourselves.
	The Graduate School provides five years of full funding to each student admitted by our department, including tuition, medical insurance, and either a fellowship stipend or teaching fellow support for living expenses (currently $33,624 for 2017-18). Incoming students will receive three years of stipendiary support (straight scholarship, no teaching), usually taken in the 1st, 2nd, and final years, and two years of teaching fellow support (assisting in courses or tutoring in our undergraduate Literature Concentration), usually done in the 3rd and 4th years. There is also a fifth year ofThe Department receives many inquiries each year from prospective students. We have found that in terms of arranging appointments with faculty, what makes the most sense is to focus our efforts on the period after applicants have found out whether or not they have been accepted. Applicants are, of course, free to contact individual faculty and request information or appointments.The Department has been consistent across the years in paying close attention to the backgrounds of candidates in languages and literatures. Usually the Committee focuses on candidates who have a solid grounding in one language and literature as well as knowledge of at least one other language and a more than passing exposure to its literature. In considering the strongest applicants, the committee looks particularly to whether or not they would be able to complete the demanding course and exam requirements of the program in a timely fashion. That said, the Department is eclectic in thatThe University requires that all applicants whose first language is not English must have taken the TOEFL within the last two years or have an undergraduate degree from an English-speaking College or University. Individual courses taken in English or at English-speaking universities do not count in place of a TOEFL.Some students come to our program having already completed some graduate work. At the end of the first semester, credits for prior graduate work are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Director of Graduate Studies. A maximum of six credits can be granted for courses that we determine are the equivalent of our graduate courses. There are restrictions about which requirement the credits can count for; these guidelines are listed in the Graduate Student Guide under “Credit for Graduate Work Done Elsewhere.”
	No, students admitted to the program enter in September only. For more information on our graduate program, please contact our Director of Graduate Studies, Professor Verena Conley (vconley@fas.harvard.edu)

		Harvard University has offered courses in Comparative Literature since 1894; the Department of Comparative Literature was established by vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on April 10, 1906. The department was reorganized in 2007 in a merger with the formerly separate undergraduate Literature Concentration. The present program is the result of a thorough review and revision of both the graduate and undergraduate programs undertaken during the academic year 2009-2010 and refined annually.
	
		Please take the time to read through the entire Guide. Please also keep the Guide for consultation. A careful perusal now, even if you are just beginning your graduate studies at Harvard, will help you to think of your program as an organic whole. Your courses, examinations, teaching, and dissertation enable you to pursue your intellectual interests while simultaneously acquiring credentials to obtain appointments in teaching and research as well as other forms of employment.

The undergraduate concentration in Comparative Literature offers students the opportunity to design a program of study that works across languages, cultures, and media in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. The open, flexible nature of the concentration allows students to develop an individualized program of study that incorporates literary and cultural analysis in the exploration of any number of fields and disciplines both within and beyond the Humanities. Some students, for example, develop a curriculum in Literature and the Arts, linking the study of literature with film, music, theater, digital media, or creative writing.  Others design programs that connect literary study to contemporary concerns and disciplines beyond the Humanities, focusing their work on the relationship between Literature and Medicine, for example, or Literature and Law, or Literature and Ethics.  Still other students find in the study of Comparative Literature a place for the comparative study of multiple literatures, World Literature, and translation, or the examination of aesthetics, philosophy, and literary and cultural theory. In short, the undergraduate program in Comparative Literature provides an ideal home for students who wish to craft a comparative and interdisciplinary concentration that is embedded in the Humanities but has the potential to reach beyond. Read more about the Comparative Literature Concentration in the Harvard College Handbook for Students.

	The undergraduate program in Comparative Literature at Harvard prepares students to play an active and creative role in today’s globalized world by exploring literature and culture across languages, and investigating the intersections and inter-connections among literatures, cultures, media, and disciplines. 

	Students in Comparative Literature design a course of study tailored to their particular interests, and work in languages as diverse as English and German, French and Hindi, Spanish and Arabic, Chinese and Latin.  Some students have fluency in their foreign language(s) of choice when they join the program, while others develop their linguistic fluency as they pursue their studies in the concentration. Comp Lit concentrators can connect their literary studies with broader interests in the Humanities, such as film, digital media, and music.  They can also incorporate their literary studies into their interests in other fields, such as law, medicine, and the environment. Many of our students bring a comparative disciplinary element into their program of studies (literature and gender studies; literature and philosophy; literature and government), while others pursue a joint concentration directly.

	If you are interested in concentrating in Comparative Literature, our Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Sandra Naddaff, will be happy to answer any of your questions. She also holds office hours by appointment (Fall 2017 Office Hours: Wednesdays 4:30-6m). Please call (617-495-4186) or email our Program Coordinator if you wish to sign up for an appointment. You may also email Dr. Naddaff directly (snaddaff@fas.harvard.edu) with any questions you might have. We look forward to hearing from you and to meeting many of you in the coming year! 

	This fall, we have organized several events that are designed to introduce you to what it is like to be a concentrator in our department.  You are encouraged to attend at least one of the following events: 

	Our Concentration Admission season occurs in the fall for Harvard students in their sophomore year. This year, applications to Comparative Literature are due on Friday, October 27th 2017, by 4 pm.Please review the Harvard College Handbook for Students for a description of the Comparative Literature concentration and its requirements.

	Feel free to contact any one of our Peer Advisors for more information on what it's like to concentrate in Comparative Literature:

	You will also find many more details in our Comp Lit brochure.

	Students who have concentrated in Comparative Literature have gone on to careers in a variety of fields:  academics, journalism, film, law, medicine, and business, among others. Please see our Alumni List for specific examples. Here are also some testimonies about our concentration from some of our alumni: Alumni Voices.

Comparative Literature offers a secondary field for students who are interested in the study of literature, literary and cultural theory, and other forms of representation in more than one culture or language. More information about the Comparative Literature secondary field can be found in the Harvard College Handbook for Students.All students interested in pursuing a secondary field in Comparative Literature should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Sandra Naddaff (617-495-5650) as soon as possible to discuss their program of study. Since only Comparative Literature students are allowed to enroll in Comp Lit 97, students pursuing a secondary field in Comparative Literature should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the first meeting of the sophomore tutorial (in the spring semester.) The DUS will be responsible for advising these students, although the expectation will be that students working towards a secondary field in Comparative Literature will monitor their own progress towards fulfillment of the requirements.

The undergraduate concentration in Comparative Literature offers students the opportunity to design a program of study that works across languages, cultures, and media in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. The open, flexible nature of the concentration allows students to develop an individualized program of study that incorporates literary and cultural analysis in the exploration of any number of fields and disciplines both within and beyond the Humanities. Some students, for example, develop a curriculum in Literature and the Arts, linking the study of literature with film, music, theater, digital media, or creative writing.  Others design programs that connect literary study to contemporary concerns and disciplines beyond the Humanities, focusing their work on the relationship between Literature and Medicine, for example, or Literature and Law, or Literature and Ethics.  Still other students find in the study of Comparative Literature a place for the comparative study of multiple literatures, World Literature, and translation, or the examination of aesthetics, philosophy, and literary and cultural theory. In short, the undergraduate program in Comparative Literature provides an ideal home for students who wish to craft a comparative and interdisciplinary concentration that is embedded in the Humanities but has the potential to reach beyond.Given the comparative nature of our program, the knowledge of more than one language and national literature is essential.  Our students work in a multitude of languages—Hindi, French, Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Arabic, Swahili—to name but a few.  We welcome work in any language in which a student has interest and is able to take minimally 3 courses in which they work in the original language.  In cases where a student does not have the necessary linguistic competence to undertake literary study, we are happy to help make arrangements to acquire the necessary proficiency through continued course work or summer study. Students with degrees in Comparative Literature develop habits of mind that serve them well in any number of professional endeavors.  The ability to write well, to read critically, to argue analytically, and to speak eloquently, translates fluently to a variety of fields. Alumni have gone on to careers in a wide variety of fields, including academics, journalism, film, law, medicine, and business. Notable Lit alumni include A.O. Scott (1988), film critic for The New York Times; Kelefa Sanneh (1997), staff writer for The New Yorker; Elif Batuman (1999), author of The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them; Alexandra McCormack (2000), corporate lawyer with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York; B.J. Novak (2001), Actor (The Office, Inglorious Basterds); Rasheed Sabar (2005), portfolio manager for the Ellington Management Group hedge fund; and Cara Eisenpress (2007), cookbook author (In the Small Kitchen: 100 Recipes from Our Year of Cooking in the Real World). - Sandra Naddaff

The application can be filled out on-line at the same address. You should make every effort to ensure that all supporting materials (transcripts, recommendations) arrive by the application deadline. No applications for admission will be accepted after the deadline set by GSAS.The Writing Sample: The writing sample is supposed to demonstrate your ability to engage in literary criticism and/or theory. It can be a paper written for a course or a section of a senior thesis or essay. It is usually between 10-20 pages. Do not send longer papers with instructions to read an excerpt; you should edit the sample so that it is no longer than 20 pages.  Writing samples should be in English, although candidates are permitted to submit an additional writing sample written in a different language.Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose should give the admissions committee a clear sense of your individual interests and strengths. You need not indicate at the time of application precisely what your field of specialization will be, but it is helpful to tell us about your aspirations and how the Comparative Literature department at Harvard might help in attaining these goals. These statements are usually between one and four pages long.Recommendations: It is important to have strong letters of recommendation from professors who are familiar with your academic work. An applicant who has been out of school for several years should try to reestablish contact with former professors. Additional letters from employers may also be included.Subject and program number: Our Harvard GSAS subject and program number is 1700 - this number is for use on the Harvard application.  

	Graduate Record Examination (GRE) codes: GRE scores should be reported to Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Code 3451.For more information on our graduate program, please contact our Director of Graduate Studies, Professor Verena Conley (vconley@fas.harvard.edu)

	The best place to start is with the admissions website: www.gsas.harvard.edu (which also contains the link for the Comparative Literature program description) and with the course catalogue at https://courses.my.harvard.edu/. This gives you an idea of who is teaching what and whether your interests are well represented at Harvard. This also gives you the foundation from which to ask specific questions.
While a high score in the verbal part of the test is a positive addition to the application, it is by no means the most important aspect of a candidacy. You should plan to take the GRE as early as possible and it should not be taken later than October in order to ensure arrival of scores as part of the application. December exam results can arrive too late to be considered. We do not require a GRE subject test.We do not ask for GPA but your overall grades do play an important role in the application process.We pay careful attention in evaluating prospective applicants to make sure that they would be able to satisfy our program requirements in a reasonable span of time. Our program requires declaring four languages, with coursework in three of them (one of which may be English). Most students we admit have a solid grounding in two literatures and languages and have had exposure to another (or more). Our program allows time for further language study as well. It is important for your application to give a clear idea of what level of language preparation you have. For instance, languages listedNo. You can take a master’s degree only if you are enrolled at Harvard College as an undergraduate. The only way to enter Comparative Literature is through the Ph.D. program, although once you are enrolled in our program you may take the A.M. degree in passing.Because we have over a hundred applicants annually and far more requests that do not result in applications, we tend to economize on the time of our students, who are the centerpiece and raison d’être of the whole program, by not involving them officially until after students have been admitted, at which point we put candidates in touch with students who have similar interests. Before then, potential applicants are welcome to contact students whom they know, but we do not connect applicants with students ourselves.
	The Graduate School provides five years of full funding to each student admitted by our department, including tuition, medical insurance, and either a fellowship stipend or teaching fellow support for living expenses (currently $33,624 for 2017-18). Incoming students will receive three years of stipendiary support (straight scholarship, no teaching), usually taken in the 1st, 2nd, and final years, and two years of teaching fellow support (assisting in courses or tutoring in our undergraduate Literature Concentration), usually done in the 3rd and 4th years. There is also a fifth year ofThe Department receives many inquiries each year from prospective students. We have found that in terms of arranging appointments with faculty, what makes the most sense is to focus our efforts on the period after applicants have found out whether or not they have been accepted. Applicants are, of course, free to contact individual faculty and request information or appointments.The Department has been consistent across the years in paying close attention to the backgrounds of candidates in languages and literatures. Usually the Committee focuses on candidates who have a solid grounding in one language and literature as well as knowledge of at least one other language and a more than passing exposure to its literature. In considering the strongest applicants, the committee looks particularly to whether or not they would be able to complete the demanding course and exam requirements of the program in a timely fashion. That said, the Department is eclectic in thatThe University requires that all applicants whose first language is not English must have taken the TOEFL within the last two years or have an undergraduate degree from an English-speaking College or University. Individual courses taken in English or at English-speaking universities do not count in place of a TOEFL.Some students come to our program having already completed some graduate work. At the end of the first semester, credits for prior graduate work are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Director of Graduate Studies. A maximum of six credits can be granted for courses that we determine are the equivalent of our graduate courses. There are restrictions about which requirement the credits can count for; these guidelines are listed in the Graduate Student Guide under “Credit for Graduate Work Done Elsewhere.”
	No, students admitted to the program enter in September only. For more information on our graduate program, please contact our Director of Graduate Studies, Professor Verena Conley (vconley@fas.harvard.edu)

	 Welcome from the Director of Graduate StudiesWelcome to the graduate program in Comparative Literature at Harvard University! It is a pleasure to do so!

	Our academic community is comprised of thirty-two faculty members and nearly fifty graduate students from across the globe that come here to study, teach, and publish on literatures in several dozen languages from a wide range of historical periods. We take great pride in this community, its academic accomplishments and collective efforts. And its intellectual profile is equally diverse. Critical theory, literary interpretation, and comparative philology provide the basis for work on translation, the history of ideas, gender, drama, oral poetics, multilingualism, postcolonialism, the environmental and medical humanities, globalization, and world literature. Our students and faculty also work in a variety of fields contiguous with literature, including architecture and the visual arts, film and music, history, anthropology, philosophy, and medicine.

	In our graduate seminars students analyze in comparative perspective the literatures and other cultural products of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Coursework is designed to meet individual interests. Our graduate students are encouraged as well to complement our doctoral seminars with courses in other literature and area studies departments (with which most of our faculty hold joint appointments), including African and African American Studies, the Classics, East Asian Languages and Civilizations, English, Germanic Languages and Literatures, History, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Romance Languages and Literatures, Slavic Languages and Literatures, and South Asian Studies. Many of our students also engage in interdisciplinary work, taking courses and often earning qualification in secondary fields such as Visual and Environmental Studies, Medieval Studies, Music, the Study of Religion and the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality.

	The stunning range of our students’ dissertation projects is well supported by Harvard’s unparalleled library resources. Our library system, the largest university collection in the world, comprises 70 libraries, with combined holdings of over 16 million items.

	In the past few years, the faculty has restructured the Comparative Literature program so as to attend better to students’ needs as they prepare for a professional career in the twenty-first century. New course and language requirements allow students to engage more fully in sophisticated comparative work from their very first year at Harvard. We have also established specific guidelines for advising and faculty feedback from the first year through the completion of the Ph.D. Our new Survive and Thrive: Graduate School and Beyond seminar prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of graduate school.  And our Renato Poggioli Graduate Colloquium series enables students of all levels to present their works-in-progress to peers and faculty, everything from seminar papers to mock job talks.

	Given the nature of graduate projects, most of our students spend time abroad for language training and research. This work is largely funded by fellowships from the graduate school as well as from Harvard’s many area centers.

	When in Cambridge, students enjoy the department's home, the historic Dana-Palmer House at 16 Quincy Street. We look forward at Dana Palmer to welcoming you in the Fall with sheer delight and open arms!

	For more on our graduate program, please consult the Guide for Graduate Students.

		Harvard University has offered courses in Comparative Literature since 1894; the Department of Comparative Literature was established by vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on April 10, 1906. The department was reorganized in 2007 in a merger with the formerly separate undergraduate Literature Concentration. The present program is the result of a thorough review and revision of both the graduate and undergraduate programs undertaken during the academic year 2009-2010 and refined annually.
	
		Please take the time to read through the entire Guide. Please also keep the Guide for consultation. A careful perusal now, even if you are just beginning your graduate studies at Harvard, will help you to think of your program as an organic whole. Your courses, examinations, teaching, and dissertation enable you to pursue your intellectual interests while simultaneously acquiring credentials to obtain appointments in teaching and research as well as other forms of employment.

	The undergraduate program in Comparative Literature at Harvard prepares students to play an active and creative role in today’s globalized world by exploring literature and culture across languages, and investigating the intersections and inter-connections among literatures, cultures, media, and disciplines. 

	Students in Comparative Literature design a course of study tailored to their particular interests, and work in languages as diverse as English and German, French and Hindi, Spanish and Arabic, Chinese and Latin.  Some students have fluency in their foreign language(s) of choice when they join the program, while others develop their linguistic fluency as they pursue their studies in the concentration. Comp Lit concentrators can connect their literary studies with broader interests in the Humanities, such as film, digital media, and music.  They can also incorporate their literary studies into their interests in other fields, such as law, medicine, and the environment. Many of our students bring a comparative disciplinary element into their program of studies (literature and gender studies; literature and philosophy; literature and government), while others pursue a joint concentration directly.

	If you are interested in concentrating in Comparative Literature, our Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Sandra Naddaff, will be happy to answer any of your questions. She also holds office hours by appointment (Fall 2017 Office Hours: Wednesdays 4:30-6m). Please call (617-495-4186) or email our Program Coordinator if you wish to sign up for an appointment. You may also email Dr. Naddaff directly (snaddaff@fas.harvard.edu) with any questions you might have. We look forward to hearing from you and to meeting many of you in the coming year! 

	This fall, we have organized several events that are designed to introduce you to what it is like to be a concentrator in our department.  You are encouraged to attend at least one of the following events: 

	Our Concentration Admission season occurs in the fall for Harvard students in their sophomore year. This year, applications to Comparative Literature are due on Friday, October 27th 2017, by 4 pm.Please review the Harvard College Handbook for Students for a description of the Comparative Literature concentration and its requirements.

	Feel free to contact any one of our Peer Advisors for more information on what it's like to concentrate in Comparative Literature:

	You will also find many more details in our Comp Lit brochure.

	Students who have concentrated in Comparative Literature have gone on to careers in a variety of fields:  academics, journalism, film, law, medicine, and business, among others. Please see our Alumni List for specific examples. Here are also some testimonies about our concentration from some of our alumni: Alumni Voices.

Comparative Literature offers a secondary field for students who are interested in the study of literature, literary and cultural theory, and other forms of representation in more than one culture or language. More information about the Comparative Literature secondary field can be found in the Harvard College Handbook for Students.All students interested in pursuing a secondary field in Comparative Literature should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Sandra Naddaff (617-495-5650) as soon as possible to discuss their program of study. Since only Comparative Literature students are allowed to enroll in Comp Lit 97, students pursuing a secondary field in Comparative Literature should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the first meeting of the sophomore tutorial (in the spring semester.) The DUS will be responsible for advising these students, although the expectation will be that students working towards a secondary field in Comparative Literature will monitor their own progress towards fulfillment of the requirements.

The undergraduate concentration in Comparative Literature offers students the opportunity to design a program of study that works across languages, cultures, and media in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. The open, flexible nature of the concentration allows students to develop an individualized program of study that incorporates literary and cultural analysis in the exploration of any number of fields and disciplines both within and beyond the Humanities. Some students, for example, develop a curriculum in Literature and the Arts, linking the study of literature with film, music, theater, digital media, or creative writing.  Others design programs that connect literary study to contemporary concerns and disciplines beyond the Humanities, focusing their work on the relationship between Literature and Medicine, for example, or Literature and Law, or Literature and Ethics.  Still other students find in the study of Comparative Literature a place for the comparative study of multiple literatures, World Literature, and translation, or the examination of aesthetics, philosophy, and literary and cultural theory. In short, the undergraduate program in Comparative Literature provides an ideal home for students who wish to craft a comparative and interdisciplinary concentration that is embedded in the Humanities but has the potential to reach beyond.Given the comparative nature of our program, the knowledge of more than one language and national literature is essential.  Our students work in a multitude of languages—Hindi, French, Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Arabic, Swahili—to name but a few.  We welcome work in any language in which a student has interest and is able to take minimally 3 courses in which they work in the original language.  In cases where a student does not have the necessary linguistic competence to undertake literary study, we are happy to help make arrangements to acquire the necessary proficiency through continued course work or summer study. Students with degrees in Comparative Literature develop habits of mind that serve them well in any number of professional endeavors.  The ability to write well, to read critically, to argue analytically, and to speak eloquently, translates fluently to a variety of fields. Alumni have gone on to careers in a wide variety of fields, including academics, journalism, film, law, medicine, and business. Notable Lit alumni include A.O. Scott (1988), film critic for The New York Times; Kelefa Sanneh (1997), staff writer for The New Yorker; Elif Batuman (1999), author of The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them; Alexandra McCormack (2000), corporate lawyer with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York; B.J. Novak (2001), Actor (The Office, Inglorious Basterds); Rasheed Sabar (2005), portfolio manager for the Ellington Management Group hedge fund; and Cara Eisenpress (2007), cookbook author (In the Small Kitchen: 100 Recipes from Our Year of Cooking in the Real World). - Sandra Naddaff

The Department of Comparative Literature each year welcomes a limited number of qualified visitors whose academic interests intersect directly with the teaching and research activities of the department's faculty members. Because the department’s faculty members and students thrive on intellectual engagement with guest researchers, visitors are encouraged to participate actively in the life of the department and the university, attending lectures, conferences, film showings, and classes with permission of the instructor. Visitors may be invited to present an informal talk or seminar during the course of their stay.  English language proficiency is assumed, and will be verified by the faculty host.Although these visiting appointments carry no financial support of any kind, visitors are given a Harvard e-mail address and a Harvard identification card, which gives them access to Harvard College libraries and museums. The University provides assistance with the visa process for scholars coming from outside the United States. Visitors are entirely responsible for obtaining their own funding, for making their own travel and living arrangements, and for obtaining health insurance. The Department is unable to provide office space or supplies.The Department of Comparative Literature hosts three types of visitors:1.    Visiting Scholar: doctorate not required, but usually in hand.  The Visiting Scholar appointment enables individuals, ordinarily ladder faculty members on paid leave from another institution (tenured or tenure-track), to carry out their own work in association with a Harvard faculty member.2.    Fellow: for individuals who have recently received the Ph.D. or are currently in the final years of a Ph.D. program.  The Fellow appointment allows advanced graduate students and Ph.D.'s in the early years of their scholarly careers opportunities for individual research under the guidance of a department faculty member.3.    Associates: generally for alumni of the department or other individuals with a need for department affiliation.  For more on the Associate program, please contact the department.  The department gives preference for appointments of 12 months’ duration; with rare exception, Visiting Scholars are not accepted for less than 6 months, and the absolute minimum is three months. Extensions to the initial appointment are granted only very rarely.How to ApplyAcceptance as a visitor is competitive; the department can accommodate only a handful of individuals at any one time.  Applications should include the following (all materials must be in English):1.    current curriculum vitae2.    brief description (1-2 pages) of research project3.    cover letter specifying the desired dates of appointment4.    brief letter from the Comparative Literature faculty member who has agreed to sponsor the visitPlease note, the department has recently changed its application procedures.  Applications for the academic year 2018-2019 are due January 15, 2018, for review first by the department’s Visiting Scholars Committee and then by the full department at its February 2018 department meeting.  The department is aware that many fellowship applications require a formal letter of invitation, but the department cannot make exceptions to the above dates and urges potential visiting scholars/fellows to plan accordingly.Applications should be sent by email to Melissa Carden, Department Administrator (carden@fas.harvard.edu).  The department’s mailing address is 16 Quincy Street, Dana-Palmer House, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.
