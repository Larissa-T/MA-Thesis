The principles governing Brown/Trinity Repertory Acting and Directing programs are based on a belief that all else proceeds from the primary image of an actor on a platform talking to an audience.Watch a video about the Brown/Trinity Rep Acting & Directing ProgramActors are not the only artists in theater, nor are they the most important, but all artists in the theater (playwrights, directors, designers, and actors) start from the premise that the essence of our art is actors engaging with an audience, and that our common goal is to explore and enhance the live, communal experience that is at the heart of theater.The course of study combines the best aspects of conservatory training with the practical experience of a three-year internship at a professional theater, enhanced by the academic courses and credentials supplied by a university degree program. Students graduating from the program should have the skills necessary to work as actors, directors, teachers, or a combination of all three.Additional resources: Brown's special collections: Harris Collection of American Drama, the Sidney Albert Shaw Collection, the Smith Magicana Collection, three theaters, eight studios, departmental library, Harvard Theatre Collection, easily accessible resources throughout New England and in New York City, as well as downtown Providence theater spaces.Completion RequirementsM.F.A. Acting: The core curriculum consists of daily acting, voice, and movement classes, supplemented by frequent workshops in specialty areas. Technique work continues throughout the program, but there is a progressive shift in emphasis from the acquisition and refinement of skills to their practical application. In the final semester, through individual and group sessions, the student focuses strongly on showcase presentations and thesis work. In addition to classroom training, assignments in the Consortium and/or Trinity Rep Company productions will be an important component of training. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of studio and mainstage productions. Understudy duties on mainstage Trinity productions may also be assigned; the combination of understudy and performance work will give the graduating student enough candidate weeks to be awarded his or her Equity card upon graduation.M.F.A. Directing: The three-year program is defined thematically in the following manner: first year: story, text analysis and dramatic action — contemporary and modern drama; second year: conceptualization - verse drama and new plays; third year: collaboration and expanded forms. Directors will participate in a weekly directors' seminar, led by members of the Brown faculty and Trinity Rep artistic staff. In addition, they will attend academic courses designed to introduce a variety of theoretical concerns and methodological approaches. Directors will also participate in collaborative courses that combine students and faculty from the programs in playwriting, acting, directing, and design. In addition to classroom work, directing students will be expected to assist on two Trinity Rep main-stage productions, direct at least four studio productions, and direct a thesis project with full design support. Members of the directing faculty will closely supervise each of these productions.Admission InformationAdmission requirements: A photo, resume, and a private audition.

						© 2017 Brown University The Department offers a concentration in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. Concentrators chose a "track" to study within the concentration -Theatre Arts,  Performance Studies, or Writing for Performance.  Students can all find a home in one of the tracks by working with faculty to best design their curricular choices.  Prospective students are welcome to visit our facilities and tours of our spaces can be arranged in advance by contacting the department directly.   Additional campus tours and info sessions are available to prospective students through the Undergraduate Admissions Office.   You are also encouraged to read our FAQ before coming to campus.  The building and main office is open for tours/questions Monday through Friday  8:30am -5pm when school is in session (Sept - end of May) and Monday through Friday 10am - 3pm during the summer (Memorial Day  - end of August).   Please be aware that there may be some dates in August when tours are not available, particularly between August 7 and 25. Undergraduates at Brown make theatre, dance, and performance-based work all over campus. Performances have been written for hallways, breezeways, walkways, as well as in our theatres.  Work has been produced without a play in mind – improvised, found, choreographed on the spot.  Other work has been incubated and nurtured for years at a time. Well-known plays from the dramatic canon are produced alongside lesser-known newcomers or buried treasures rarely produced.  Some work takes multitudes, other work flies solo. The point is that there is a lot going on in a very exciting atmosphere of creative and intellectual exchange where traditions and heritages of craft are as highly valued as the rough draft of innovation and experimentation.Classes are a key way to get to know faculty and other students well. But there are also shows to help out on as run crew. There are costumes to design and build, lights to hang, lines to memorize, muscles to stretch, voices to warm, directing projects to propose. There are producing boards to sit on and there are sets to design, productions to stage manage, dances to choreograph, plays to write, songs to write, philosophies to write, and –always – posters to hang.   Pippin, 2010 Performance Calendar  Get TicketsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

Students will be expected to read critical essays and plays, conduct research, and prepare to act in scenes that challenge the actor to confront the specifics of character and situation beyond the Eurocentric ideal. The goal is to strengthen the actor's ability to construct truly meaningful characters by removing any reliance of "type" and/or immediate "identification" with the characters they will portray. Instructor permission required; interested students must come to the first class, fill out an application and participate in a sample class. Accepted students will be notified by the third class meeting. You must show up to every class meeting in order to keep your application active throughout the registration process.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown  The Brown University/Trinity Rep MFA programs combine in-depth classroom work and an ongoing relationship to a working professional theatre. Brown University's Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies is internationally recognized for the quality of its faculty and instruction. Trinity Rep, with its deep tradition of resident artists, provides powerful artistic assets and creates a firm foundation of real-world experience. Together, the two organizations have produced a model of theatre training that is rigorous and technically demanding, without intellectual or creative limitations.Brown/Trinity includes the MFA programs in Acting and Directing. Students in each of the disciplines have many opportunities to study and work with fellow students from other areas, including the MFA Playwrighting students and the PhD students in Brown's Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. Through directly experiencing the techniques and processes involved in each discipline, students are encouraged to become true collaborators, and to break down the often artificial barriers that have traditionally separated actors, directors, and playwrights.The primary focus in the acting training is in developing technically skilled, versatile actors capable of working in the variety of styles demanded by contemporary theatre. Directors are given the opportunity to develop their own vision, working in collaboration with actors, creating new work and rediscovering existing texts.The MFA curriculum provides a rigorous training program taught by a resident faculty, supplemented by guest artists from the professional and academic arenas.Click here for more information about the current Brown/Trinity season.  For questions about the MFA programs in Acting and Directing, contact the MFA Program Administrator, Jill Jann: jill_jann@brown.edu.For questions about the application process (including GRE/TOEFL submission, LORs, and other technical questions), please contact the Graduate School directly at admission_graduate@brown.edu.Applications to the PhD and MFA programs are submitted to, and managed through, the Graduate School.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown  The Theatre Arts and Performance Studies program takes a broad-spectrum approach to the study of histories, theories, and methods of theater and performance.While offering a rigorous background in theater history in global perspective, we also use performance as an analytical tool, exploring the labor of mimesis in the social. A slate of courses with significant strength in performance theory, theater history, cultural studies, visual studies, and world performance allows students to determine the right mix of theater studies and performance studies for their projects. We offer opportunities to take classes throughout the University and encourage taking full advantage of diverse resources both on campus and in greater Providence.The consortium with Trinity Repertory Company, Brown's playwriting program, and cross-currents with RISD make the Brown environment alive with intersections between practice and theory.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown Announced by the Graduate School earlier this week, TAPS graduate student Doria Charlson has been accepted to the fifth cohort of Brown University's Open Graduate Education Program. Through this Graduate School program, doctoral students gain the flexibility and resources to pursue a master's degree in a secondary field while they earn their doctorates at Brown University. Doria will enter the master's program in History.While studying at Stanford and applying to graduate schools, Charlson noticed the Open Graduate Education program and found it "very appealing." Now a second-year doctoral student at Brown, she sees it as a way to gain a stronger historical foundation for her research on performance historiography and understanding of North African and French colonial history.Charlson says:"The program will allow me to branch out and have a larger community of colleagues and broader conversations. The credentialing will be helpful, it will allow me to think more broadly about jobs I'm qualified for, and having some legibility as an expert will make me more relatable to more faculty.For more information, visit the Graduate School website.

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown The Department offers a concentration in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. Concentrators chose a "track" to study within the concentration -Theatre Arts,  Performance Studies, or Writing for Performance.  Students can all find a home in one of the tracks by working with faculty to best design their curricular choices.  Prospective students are welcome to visit our facilities and tours of our spaces can be arranged in advance by contacting the department directly.   Additional campus tours and info sessions are available to prospective students through the Undergraduate Admissions Office.   You are also encouraged to read our FAQ before coming to campus.  The building and main office is open for tours/questions Monday through Friday  8:30am -5pm when school is in session (Sept - end of May) and Monday through Friday 10am - 3pm during the summer (Memorial Day  - end of August).   Please be aware that there may be some dates in August when tours are not available, particularly between August 7 and 25. Undergraduates at Brown make theatre, dance, and performance-based work all over campus. Performances have been written for hallways, breezeways, walkways, as well as in our theatres.  Work has been produced without a play in mind – improvised, found, choreographed on the spot.  Other work has been incubated and nurtured for years at a time. Well-known plays from the dramatic canon are produced alongside lesser-known newcomers or buried treasures rarely produced.  Some work takes multitudes, other work flies solo. The point is that there is a lot going on in a very exciting atmosphere of creative and intellectual exchange where traditions and heritages of craft are as highly valued as the rough draft of innovation and experimentation.Classes are a key way to get to know faculty and other students well. But there are also shows to help out on as run crew. There are costumes to design and build, lights to hang, lines to memorize, muscles to stretch, voices to warm, directing projects to propose. There are producing boards to sit on and there are sets to design, productions to stage manage, dances to choreograph, plays to write, songs to write, philosophies to write, and –always – posters to hang.   Pippin, 2010 Performance Calendar  Get TicketsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

It is a convergence of students and professionals working on departmental productions, as well as artists from other departments and the local community (including RISD/Brown Design for America, Archaeology, the RISD Sculpture department, A Better World by Design and Brown Opera Productions.)The department relies heavily on students for all of its productions, including the mainstage Sock & Buskin Season, dance concerts, and a myriad of special performance events throughout the year.  This includes paid positions for undergraduates with our Costume Shop, Production Manager's office, Scene Shop, Design Studio, and Publicity/Box Office/House Management.  Please check the student employment website for current openings with our department.  Please note that graduate students and non-Brown students are not eligible for employment with the department.Working in the costume shop Performance Calendar  Get TicketsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown You don't have to be a concentrator to direct a show or a piece of live art. The Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies not only offers a chance for a TAPS concentrator to direct a mainstage show every year, but we also offer faculty support to all of our students who seek mentorship when directing on any and all of their projects. Don't forget that there are student directing opportunities all over  Brown's campus. Take a look through the list of student performance groups, many of whom offer a myriad of directing opportunities throughout the year. A stellar opportunity for TAPS concentrators is directing for the Senior Slot. Every  Spring, a junior concentrator is selected to direct a funded  and  staffed production in their senior year, as part of the Sock & Buskin mainstage season. If you are interested in directing and concentrating, consider the Theatre Arts concentration track. For a more in-depth description of the concentration and the Senior Slot opportunity consult the Undergraduate Handbook. Performance Calendar  Get TicketsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown As with directing opportunities, you do not have to be a concentrator to be a playwright. Many a student playwright has found a home on campus within the many student groups producing theatre.If you are interested in writing for performance (including writing for dance), and concentrating in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies you would be a great fit for our Writing for Performance concentration track. The Senior Slot opportunity for concentrators provides an invaluable experience for a student playwright to see their play receive a funded and staffed production on the department mainstage. For a description of this opportunity, and the benefits involved, see the Senior Slot opportunity section in our Undergraduate Handbook.  Performance Calendar  Get TicketsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA

          © 2017 Brown UniversityConnect: Social@Brown A unique and special thing about Brown Theatre is that students  have a great deal of responsibility in the department's production season.  The season is selected by the Sock  & Buskin board, a team of students and faculty. Sock & Buskin produces a numer of major productions each year and plans the schedule for the next year. Students are more numerous than faculty on the board and  so have a greater vote when the final season is decided – a situation  unmatched at any other university. Our philosophy: if the faculty are working productively with students in classes, we should respect  them enough to design a vital and invigorating season. And we do! And  they do!Each year, the Sock & Buskin board chooses a season consisting of four mainstage theatrical shows and one mainstage dance performance to be  produced during the following academic year. The board also chooses a fifth show, the “senior  slot.” Senior slot, determined by faculty who select from proposals  submitted by junior concentrators, is a mainstage show running for one week and is open to juniors who wish to direct or write a full production of their  choosing in their senior year. You can keep up with Sock & Buskin on their website, or by following them on Twitter.Cast of Gross Indecency, 2011To suggest a play for our season or to request more information send an email to sockandbuskin@gmail.com. You may also drop a script or just a note with a title in the suggestion box outside the Brown Theatre Box Office in the Leeds Theatre lobby.Sock & Buskin was founded in 1901 by Professor Thomas Crosby of the Brown University English Department. There has since been an unbroken record of seasons, first at the Providence Opera House and various theatres in downcity Providence, then in Rockefeller Hall, and finally in 1931 at the Faunce House Theatre, which was restored and reopened as Stuart Theatre in 1993. When the Isabelle Russek Leeds Theatre and Ashamu Dance Studio were built in 1979, they joined the Stuart Theatre and together became the Catherine Bryan Dill Center for the Performing Arts.Jared Bellot in Dead City, 2011In 1927, Sock & Buskin, which was at the time an all-male organization, began using actresses in its productions. Soon Komians, the all-female theatrical group from Pembroke college, merged with Sock & Buskin to create the co-ed group that exists today.When Sock & Buskin isn't reading plays in the Becker Library, they support production staff by running auditions, assisting construction of sets and costumes, and publicizing Sock & Buskin events around campus. It's a great way for students to get involved in the department and learn about the different aspects of producing theatre. Tuesday meetings are open to the public and visitors are welcomed.Pippin, 2010 Performance Calendar  Get TicketsProvidence, Rhode Island 02912, USA
