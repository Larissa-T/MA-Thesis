 Degree Tutor: Professor David d'AvrayAbout the DegreeAn Overview of the Degree Degree StructureProspective StudentsCurrent StudentsModulesStudent viewsInduction Information for September 2017 (coming soon)UCL's MA in Medieval and Renaissance Studies (MARS) is an 
innovative interdisciplinary programme taught and run by leading 
professors and scholars in the field. The MA is 1 year full-time or 2 
years part-time. MARS is demanding, cosmopolitan and stimulating. We 
place particular emphasis on equipping students who want to do PhDs with
 the skills they need. We are based in the heart of London's Bloomsbury,
 at the centre of an exceptional confluence of libraries and 
museums.Our experienced current external examiner says:'I am very impressed by UCL's Medieval and Renaissance Studies MA course. The wide range of options, including the possibility to study not only Latin, but various medieval vernaculars, manuscripts and a variety of topics at a very high level, is remarkable. The standard of both the examinations and dissertations was overall very high. It was a pleasure to see that so many students engaged seriously with original sources, including manuscripts, in a thoroughly professional manner. Some of the dissertations were of publishable quality, and I hope many students go on to a PhD. I would strongly recommend the programme to any student with a serious interest in medieval history.'Our previous external examiner (to 2011), an experienced medievalist and Fellow of the British Academy, says:Everything I see in the conception, teaching and assessment of courses is of the very highest standards. The UCL MA provides the best pre-PhD technical training of any MA of which I have any knowledge. Given the remarkable quality of the course, and the extraordinary care, skill and enthusiasm with which they are taught and supervised, it is wholly unsurprising that a high proportion gain distinctions.'You can see a range of recent students' views on the course here:1. 30 credits of language-based modules2. 60 credits of taught modules taken from the full MARS module list.  This may include up to 30 credits from outside of the MARS module list, subject to approval by the Degree Tutor.3. 30 credits of taught modules which may include Skills and Sources options4. 60 credits dissertation All
of our MA students produce a research dissertation of up to 12,000 words on a
topic of their choice. This is the culmination of the degree, allowing you to
build on the training you have received through your
elective modules to develop a specialist area of research, written under the
expert supervision of a UCL-based academic. Page last modified on 10 jul 15 14:59
			
                        The Medieval and Renaissance Studies MA is a flexible degree that permits you to specialise
or take a broad interdisciplinary range of modules. Students should refer to the degree structure when selecting modules. Please ensure that you discuss your module selections with the MARS Degree Tutor (Professor David d'Avray).Please note that modules running in 2017/18 are dependent on student demand. If there is no or low demand from students, modules may be cancelled.If you wish to take a MDVLG*** module please contact the MARS administration team to enquire about availability and to reserve a space. You should note that places for intercollegiate and interdepartmental students are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority is given to MARS students and to students on degrees affiliated with MARS. Please note that your place will not be confirmed until the first week of teaching.It may also be possible for students to take intercollegiate modules offered on King's College London's MA in Medieval History, however this is subject to availability and the approval of the MARS Degree Tutor and the module tutor(s) at King's. Students should contact history@kcl.ac.uk to enquire. Page last modified on 02 oct 17 10:59

This part of the module teaches students how to translate medieval sources, with an emphasis on the basic skills: using a standard classical Latin dictionary; using medieval or Renaissance Latin dictionaries; individuating the first things to look for when translating a sentence; the importance of knowing how to tune the effort to the needs (sometimes understanding the sense is enough, at other times a carefully articulated translation is essential).Assessment: 1 X 1-hour unseen examinationPage last modified on 28 apr 17 10:11
			© UCL 1999–2017Credits: 30Timetable: TBCPlease note: The module is taught alongside the undergraduate module, SCAN1401. Graduate students will receive five extra hours
of tutorials on topics to be determined in consultation with the lecturer.Old Norse, the medieval precursor to the modern Scandinavian 
languages, was once heard throughout Europe and beyond. During the Middle Ages 
Scandinavian ships travelled west to North America and east to Istanbul. The 
scope and variety of the Old Norse literary corpus matches the remarkable span 
of these journeys: myths and legends, love- and battle-poetry, prose narratives 
about kings, adventurers, poets and saints are all found in Old Norse. This 
module will introduce students to a wide range of Old Norse language and 
literature, situated within the broader context of the history and culture of 
Viking and medieval Scandinavia. Students will develop a good understanding of 
the basics of Old Norse grammar and by the end of the module will be able to 
translate medieval Icelandic prose and some forms of poetry. They will become 
familiar with key texts in the Eddic, skaldic and saga traditions, and will 
begin to explore ways in which contemporary scholarship can shed light on the 
complex but rewarding world of medieval literature.Assessment: 1 X 3-hour examination Preparatory Reading and Set Texts: Students are advised to obtain a copy of A New Introduction to Old 
Norse – Part 1: Grammar, ed. Michael Barnes (London, 2004). The two set texts will be Ari Þorgilsson’s Íslendingabók and Auðunar 
þáttr in A New Introduction to Old Norse – Part II: Reader, ed. Anthony Faulkes 
(London, 2008). Both volumes, as well as the accompanying glossary, are available online.  The following will offer a good introduction to the subject:Page last modified on 22 aug 16 09:45

Magic existed in diverse forms
in the middle ages: from simple charms to complex and subversive demonic magic.
Its negative characteristics were defined by theologians who sought to isolate
undesirable rituals and beliefs, but there were also many who believed that the
condemned texts and practices were valuable and compatible with orthodox piety.
This course will explore the place of magic in the medieval world and the
contradictory responses it evoked, with a particular emphasis on manuscript
sources. We will use translations of medieval magical works and scans of
manuscript images and texts. The aim of the course is not only to deepen
students’ historical understanding and further their analytical skills but also
to give students interested in planning their own research projects experience
in the techniques of reading medieval manuscripts.Prerequisites: Students on this course must be studying, or have already taken a course in, Latin or a medieval vernacular language. Please contact the course tutor with any queries.Credits: 30Assessment: 2 X 4,000 word essaysPage last modified on 26 jun 17 10:25

Using important examples of books containing poetry and prose, students will be taught to read medieval handwriting, and how books were constructed and produced. The second strand of the module will include broader social and literary issues concerning medieval books such as patronage and ownership; readership, both male and female; the changing role of scribes and illuminators both in making books and helping to fashion assumptions about reading and interpretation; genre; and locality. By providing a range of material from the Anglo-Saxon period to the later Middle Ages, students will have the opportunity to compare books across both periods while still receiving specialised tuition on each. Old English will be studied in one term and Middle English in the other. Some prior knowledge of Old English or Middle English literature, but not both, is required for the module.Assessment for MDVLGE06: 2 x 5,000 word essaysPage last modified on 25 jul 16 10:17

			© UCL 1999–2017 DR PATRICK LANTSCHNERGlobalisation is often understood as a modern phenomenon, but medieval
historians are currently debating the extent to which it is feasible and desirable
to write a history of global connections and comparisons for the period between
500 and 1500 – an era during which new political formations emerged, religious
systems expanded and urbanisation thickened in many parts of Eurasia, while nomads
migrated across long distances, mercantile networks were consolidated and the
Black Death spread from Asia to Europe.The purpose of this module is to think conceptually and
methodologically about the challenges of writing a global history of the Middle
Ages and to question conventional understandings of periodisation, geographical
areas, and meanings of the ‘global’. Students can make original and
thought-provoking contributions to what is an evolving debate and are
encouraged to think about their own research interests within a global context. Credits: 15Assessment: 1 X 4,000 word essayPage last modified on 26 jun 17 10:05
			© UCL 1999–2017Credits: 15Timetable: Thursdays, 2-4pm, Term 2This module is concerned primarily with stories. In particular, students will
investigate how writers in the central Middle Ages told stories about their
past. What did they want to know and remember? What counted as valid historical
evidence? How important was the preservation of the past to identity in the
present? In what ways did choices about content, language and structure shape
the picture of the past? Was there a ‘Twelfth-Century Renaissance’ (C.H.
Haskins) or a ‘Crisis of the Twelfth Century’ (T. Bisson) in storytelling and
narrative? Students will have the opportunity to explore and compare written
material in a variety of genres, including annals, saints’ lives, medieval
biography, world history, poetry and narrative. Essential to the study of
historical writing is a consideration of impact and audience, so students will
consider medieval readers, transmission and manuscript evidence with visits to
library and museum collections.Assessment: 1 X 4,000 word essayPage last modified on 12 apr 16 11:56

			© UCL 1999–2017 The MARS MA is distinguished from
other similar MAs by its special emphasis on the skills medievalists needs for
advanced research. The intensive Latin, Medieval English Book and
Manuscripts modules are salient examples but even selected modules that are not
explicitly skills orientated can be enhanced by a 15 credit ‘Skills and
Sources’ component designed to inculcate research techniques with special
reference to the content of the module. The assessment for these modules, which
builds on modules students are already taking, focuses specifically on issues of
source criticism and evaluation and/or technical skills needed for advanced
research on such sources (e.g. palaeographical, linguistic etc). MDVLG005 Skills and Sources: Manuscripts and DocumentsMDVLGE11 Skills and Sources: The Medieval English BookMDVLGH92 Skills and

			© UCL 1999–2017 We emphasise intensive teaching in small groups; one-to-one
 tutorials outside of classes; and in providing students with all the 
support we can so that they can flourish on this stimulating and 
demanding course.  This approach draws not only on our own expertise but also 
on our position at the heart of one the world's greatest collections of 
manuscript, library and museum resources. In particular, students have 
the exceptional privilege of being taught inside the British Library's Manuscripts Reading Room on medieval and renaissance manuscripts of their own choosing, relating to their own interests.  Our location also means that MARS students are no more than seven minutes walk away from: The Institute of Historical Research (IHR), the Warburg Institute, Senate House Library and its palaeography collection, the Wellcome Institute Library and Dr Williams Library.
 Students are introduced to these libraries, and we regularly organise 
guided trips to nearby museums with medieval and renaissance 
collections, such as the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Gallery. We also have a MARS Centre, and are actively involved in a range of lively seminars in Bloomsbury, including at the Warburg, the IHR and our own graduate-run Medieval and Renaissance Interdisciplinary Seminar. Teaching is done in groups of about 3 to 12 students. In 
addition, students have individual tutorials in relation to essays, and 
have regular one-to-one tutorial meetings with supervisors when working 
on dissertations. All MARS teaching is provided by experienced 
academics. We place a premium on accessibility, and students will find 
teachers - however senior - available, and happy, to meet with them.  As across UCL, and particularly on MARS, students are 
taught by staff who are conducting their own research on the topics 
which they are teaching. Most modules therefore give students the 
opportunity to experience new research as it is produced.  MARS is designed particularly to equip students with the 
skills necessary for medieval and renaissance doctoral work, while 
retaining a very flexible curriculum. All students must take one medieval or renaissance 
language. The selection ranges from Old Norse, Latin, medieval Italian 
and many more. Beyond this students are free to specialise or range as 
widely as they wish. Modules are often available in a range of full-year or half-year models, allowing for either preference. For those who do want the skills needed for doctoral work, a
 range of 'skills' modules are central: 'Renaissance Texts', 'The 
Medieval English Book' and 'Manuscripts and Documents' (described by our
 external examiner as 'a jewel in the crown'). Students taking the 
full-unit options on Latin or Manuscripts and Documents have twice as 
much teaching-time than in equivalent MAs. Finally, the dissertation provides the opportunity to apply
 these skills on independent research into primary sources, on a subject
 of students' choosing. There are a wide variety of funding opportunities open to 
MARS applicants, ranging from awards of full fees and maintenance 
scholarships to bursaries of several thousand pounds. The 
interdisciplinary nature of MARS means that we can enter applicants for 
numerous scholarships across the whole of UCL. In addition there is a 
specific Chattaway Bursary for medieval graduate students. For further 
details see the UCL funding website or contact the Programme and Admissions Assistant.  MARS is an interdepartmental, interfaculty MA currently run
 by the History Department. It draws on expertise across UCL. 
Archaeology, Classics, English, French, German, History, History of Art,
 Italian, Jewish & Hebrew Studies, Scandinavian Studies and the 
School of Slavonic and East European Studies all collaborate and 
contribute to the MARS MA. MARS students therefore have an exceptional 
range of modules and staff at their disposal. Students can consequently develop a course of study exactly appropriate to, and relevant, for themselves.

 On the degree homepage you will find the Degree Tutor, further details 
and the degree structure which lists all of the components of the degree
 and their weighting. Then you can check out the modules page and see 
what is available. These usually change from year to year, but
 it will give you a good sense of what sort of modules are on 
offer. The MARS degree is interdepartmental, with its administrative base in the department of History.Programmes Administration Team - You should contact this administration team within the History department for issues to do with module 
enrolment, general queries, or any practical issues concerning your 
degree.Degree Tutor - This is the leader of the MARS degree and acts as your Personal Tutor.  Module Tutor - Your first point of contact for questions specific to the module. You can apply online and in paper form,
 though we highly recommend applying online as it will be much easier 
and quicker to track your application (and the application fee is 
halved).For general application queries (including degree and English language requirements), click here! Usually at the end of July for September entry. Some funding will 
require that you have applied and been accepted by a particular date. 
If you are applying for funding you should check with the funding body. No. Provided you submit your application by the deadline, you will 
be considered for the programme.   Yes. However, you should use the personal statement section to explain why you wish to do 
the degree. You should also aim to show 
that, though you have no formal qualifications in the subject, you have a 
strong interest and have pursued the subject independently. In exceptional cases we may accept applicants with grades 
below the pre-requisite.  However, you will need to put forward a strong
 case. All such cases must be granted by the Dean of Students, so even 
if we support your application, we cannot guarantee your place. In the 
case of mature students, there may be slightly more leeway to account 
for changes in qualifications, but all such offers are still ultimately 
decided upon outside of the Department. Some students (usually those in the process of completing 
degrees when they apply) do not have transcripts sent out until the 
August before they are due to start their MA/PhD. You can make an 
incomplete application and be considered WITHOUT your transcripts. When
 prompted to attach your transcript(s) on the online application you can 
attach a document containing a brief explanation as to why you cannot do
 so, or a letter from your university with your marks achieved so far. This will then allow you to proceed and submit. However, we cannot issue an unconditional offer until all paperwork has been provided. We
 also cannot make an unconditional offer until your application is 
complete, including acceptable proof of language proficiency (where 
appropriate) and references. The part-time MA is the same programme as the full-time 
one, but spread over two years. Usually students will take between 60 and 90 credits' worth of taught modules in their first year. In the second year, students will then take between 30 and 60
credits' worth of modules and their dissertation.  However, students can arrange the weighting of taught modules over the 2 years to suit individuals' needs.   Taught modules are usually (but not always) two-hour seminars taught during 
the daytime. We do not teach in the evenings or at weekends. You can 
discuss modules choices with your Personal Tutor and create a programme of
 study that fits around your other commitments. We do not offer distance-learning courses and class attendance is compulsory.   Most modules are taught in two-hour seminars, once a week. 15 credit modules are generally for either term 1 OR term 2 and 30 
credit modules are generally (but not always) over both terms.   This depends on the module, so check by clicking on the relevant module on the modules homepage. Some modules may have an examination. However the majority of modules
 have 1 (15 credit) or 2 (30 credit)
 pieces of assessed coursework. Yes. As an interdepartmental degree, you are already free to take modules in all of the participating MARS departments, but you can choose modules outside of these too. Indeed one of the great advantages of the degree is that you have the opportunity to take modules from a huge range. We advise students to look at other UCL departmental webpages to 
see what is on offer. For some departments, you will need to seek 
permission before enrolling on a module. Some modules (usually because 
they are highly specialised) will not be open to students outside of the
 host department.


As part of your degree you can take modules at other University of London
institutions. If the module is not connected to your degree subject you
 will need to check the degree structure first. All module choices must
 be approved by your Personal Tutor first.Page last modified on 03 may 17 11:44

                         Degree Tutor: Professor David d'AvrayAbout the DegreeAn Overview of the Degree Degree StructureProspective StudentsCurrent StudentsModulesStudent viewsInduction Information for September 2017 (coming soon)UCL's MA in Medieval and Renaissance Studies (MARS) is an 
innovative interdisciplinary programme taught and run by leading 
professors and scholars in the field. The MA is 1 year full-time or 2 
years part-time. MARS is demanding, cosmopolitan and stimulating. We 
place particular emphasis on equipping students who want to do PhDs with
 the skills they need. We are based in the heart of London's Bloomsbury,
 at the centre of an exceptional confluence of libraries and 
museums.Our experienced current external examiner says:'I am very impressed by UCL's Medieval and Renaissance Studies MA course. The wide range of options, including the possibility to study not only Latin, but various medieval vernaculars, manuscripts and a variety of topics at a very high level, is remarkable. The standard of both the examinations and dissertations was overall very high. It was a pleasure to see that so many students engaged seriously with original sources, including manuscripts, in a thoroughly professional manner. Some of the dissertations were of publishable quality, and I hope many students go on to a PhD. I would strongly recommend the programme to any student with a serious interest in medieval history.'Our previous external examiner (to 2011), an experienced medievalist and Fellow of the British Academy, says:Everything I see in the conception, teaching and assessment of courses is of the very highest standards. The UCL MA provides the best pre-PhD technical training of any MA of which I have any knowledge. Given the remarkable quality of the course, and the extraordinary care, skill and enthusiasm with which they are taught and supervised, it is wholly unsurprising that a high proportion gain distinctions.'You can see a range of recent students' views on the course here:1. 30 credits of language-based modules2. 60 credits of taught modules taken from the full MARS module list.  This may include up to 30 credits from outside of the MARS module list, subject to approval by the Degree Tutor.3. 30 credits of taught modules which may include Skills and Sources options4. 60 credits dissertation All
of our MA students produce a research dissertation of up to 12,000 words on a
topic of their choice. This is the culmination of the degree, allowing you to
build on the training you have received through your
elective modules to develop a specialist area of research, written under the
expert supervision of a UCL-based academic. Page last modified on 10 jul 15 14:59

                        The Medieval and Renaissance Studies MA is a flexible degree that permits you to specialise
or take a broad interdisciplinary range of modules. Students should refer to the degree structure when selecting modules. Please ensure that you discuss your module selections with the MARS Degree Tutor (Professor David d'Avray).Please note that modules running in 2017/18 are dependent on student demand. If there is no or low demand from students, modules may be cancelled.If you wish to take a MDVLG*** module please contact the MARS administration team to enquire about availability and to reserve a space. You should note that places for intercollegiate and interdepartmental students are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority is given to MARS students and to students on degrees affiliated with MARS. Please note that your place will not be confirmed until the first week of teaching.It may also be possible for students to take intercollegiate modules offered on King's College London's MA in Medieval History, however this is subject to availability and the approval of the MARS Degree Tutor and the module tutor(s) at King's. Students should contact history@kcl.ac.uk to enquire. Page last modified on 02 oct 17 10:59

This part of the module teaches students how to translate medieval sources, with an emphasis on the basic skills: using a standard classical Latin dictionary; using medieval or Renaissance Latin dictionaries; individuating the first things to look for when translating a sentence; the importance of knowing how to tune the effort to the needs (sometimes understanding the sense is enough, at other times a carefully articulated translation is essential).Assessment: 1 X 1-hour unseen examinationPage last modified on 28 apr 17 10:11
			© UCL 1999–2017Credits: 30Timetable: TBCPlease note: The module is taught alongside the undergraduate module, SCAN1401. Graduate students will receive five extra hours
of tutorials on topics to be determined in consultation with the lecturer.Old Norse, the medieval precursor to the modern Scandinavian 
languages, was once heard throughout Europe and beyond. During the Middle Ages 
Scandinavian ships travelled west to North America and east to Istanbul. The 
scope and variety of the Old Norse literary corpus matches the remarkable span 
of these journeys: myths and legends, love- and battle-poetry, prose narratives 
about kings, adventurers, poets and saints are all found in Old Norse. This 
module will introduce students to a wide range of Old Norse language and 
literature, situated within the broader context of the history and culture of 
Viking and medieval Scandinavia. Students will develop a good understanding of 
the basics of Old Norse grammar and by the end of the module will be able to 
translate medieval Icelandic prose and some forms of poetry. They will become 
familiar with key texts in the Eddic, skaldic and saga traditions, and will 
begin to explore ways in which contemporary scholarship can shed light on the 
complex but rewarding world of medieval literature.Assessment: 1 X 3-hour examination Preparatory Reading and Set Texts: Students are advised to obtain a copy of A New Introduction to Old 
Norse – Part 1: Grammar, ed. Michael Barnes (London, 2004). The two set texts will be Ari Þorgilsson’s Íslendingabók and Auðunar 
þáttr in A New Introduction to Old Norse – Part II: Reader, ed. Anthony Faulkes 
(London, 2008). Both volumes, as well as the accompanying glossary, are available online.  The following will offer a good introduction to the subject:Page last modified on 22 aug 16 09:45

Magic existed in diverse forms
in the middle ages: from simple charms to complex and subversive demonic magic.
Its negative characteristics were defined by theologians who sought to isolate
undesirable rituals and beliefs, but there were also many who believed that the
condemned texts and practices were valuable and compatible with orthodox piety.
This course will explore the place of magic in the medieval world and the
contradictory responses it evoked, with a particular emphasis on manuscript
sources. We will use translations of medieval magical works and scans of
manuscript images and texts. The aim of the course is not only to deepen
students’ historical understanding and further their analytical skills but also
to give students interested in planning their own research projects experience
in the techniques of reading medieval manuscripts.Prerequisites: Students on this course must be studying, or have already taken a course in, Latin or a medieval vernacular language. Please contact the course tutor with any queries.Credits: 30Assessment: 2 X 4,000 word essaysPage last modified on 26 jun 17 10:25

Using important examples of books containing poetry and prose, students will be taught to read medieval handwriting, and how books were constructed and produced. The second strand of the module will include broader social and literary issues concerning medieval books such as patronage and ownership; readership, both male and female; the changing role of scribes and illuminators both in making books and helping to fashion assumptions about reading and interpretation; genre; and locality. By providing a range of material from the Anglo-Saxon period to the later Middle Ages, students will have the opportunity to compare books across both periods while still receiving specialised tuition on each. Old English will be studied in one term and Middle English in the other. Some prior knowledge of Old English or Middle English literature, but not both, is required for the module.Assessment for MDVLGE06: 2 x 5,000 word essaysPage last modified on 25 jul 16 10:17

			© UCL 1999–2017 DR PATRICK LANTSCHNERGlobalisation is often understood as a modern phenomenon, but medieval
historians are currently debating the extent to which it is feasible and desirable
to write a history of global connections and comparisons for the period between
500 and 1500 – an era during which new political formations emerged, religious
systems expanded and urbanisation thickened in many parts of Eurasia, while nomads
migrated across long distances, mercantile networks were consolidated and the
Black Death spread from Asia to Europe.The purpose of this module is to think conceptually and
methodologically about the challenges of writing a global history of the Middle
Ages and to question conventional understandings of periodisation, geographical
areas, and meanings of the ‘global’. Students can make original and
thought-provoking contributions to what is an evolving debate and are
encouraged to think about their own research interests within a global context. Credits: 15Assessment: 1 X 4,000 word essayPage last modified on 26 jun 17 10:05
			© UCL 1999–2017Credits: 15Timetable: Thursdays, 2-4pm, Term 2This module is concerned primarily with stories. In particular, students will
investigate how writers in the central Middle Ages told stories about their
past. What did they want to know and remember? What counted as valid historical
evidence? How important was the preservation of the past to identity in the
present? In what ways did choices about content, language and structure shape
the picture of the past? Was there a ‘Twelfth-Century Renaissance’ (C.H.
Haskins) or a ‘Crisis of the Twelfth Century’ (T. Bisson) in storytelling and
narrative? Students will have the opportunity to explore and compare written
material in a variety of genres, including annals, saints’ lives, medieval
biography, world history, poetry and narrative. Essential to the study of
historical writing is a consideration of impact and audience, so students will
consider medieval readers, transmission and manuscript evidence with visits to
library and museum collections.Assessment: 1 X 4,000 word essayPage last modified on 12 apr 16 11:56

			© UCL 1999–2017 The MARS MA is distinguished from
other similar MAs by its special emphasis on the skills medievalists needs for
advanced research. The intensive Latin, Medieval English Book and
Manuscripts modules are salient examples but even selected modules that are not
explicitly skills orientated can be enhanced by a 15 credit ‘Skills and
Sources’ component designed to inculcate research techniques with special
reference to the content of the module. The assessment for these modules, which
builds on modules students are already taking, focuses specifically on issues of
source criticism and evaluation and/or technical skills needed for advanced
research on such sources (e.g. palaeographical, linguistic etc). MDVLG005 Skills and Sources: Manuscripts and DocumentsMDVLGE11 Skills and Sources: The Medieval English BookMDVLGH92 Skills and

			© UCL 1999–2017 We emphasise intensive teaching in small groups; one-to-one
 tutorials outside of classes; and in providing students with all the 
support we can so that they can flourish on this stimulating and 
demanding course.  This approach draws not only on our own expertise but also 
on our position at the heart of one the world's greatest collections of 
manuscript, library and museum resources. In particular, students have 
the exceptional privilege of being taught inside the British Library's Manuscripts Reading Room on medieval and renaissance manuscripts of their own choosing, relating to their own interests.  Our location also means that MARS students are no more than seven minutes walk away from: The Institute of Historical Research (IHR), the Warburg Institute, Senate House Library and its palaeography collection, the Wellcome Institute Library and Dr Williams Library.
 Students are introduced to these libraries, and we regularly organise 
guided trips to nearby museums with medieval and renaissance 
collections, such as the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Gallery. We also have a MARS Centre, and are actively involved in a range of lively seminars in Bloomsbury, including at the Warburg, the IHR and our own graduate-run Medieval and Renaissance Interdisciplinary Seminar. Teaching is done in groups of about 3 to 12 students. In 
addition, students have individual tutorials in relation to essays, and 
have regular one-to-one tutorial meetings with supervisors when working 
on dissertations. All MARS teaching is provided by experienced 
academics. We place a premium on accessibility, and students will find 
teachers - however senior - available, and happy, to meet with them.  As across UCL, and particularly on MARS, students are 
taught by staff who are conducting their own research on the topics 
which they are teaching. Most modules therefore give students the 
opportunity to experience new research as it is produced.  MARS is designed particularly to equip students with the 
skills necessary for medieval and renaissance doctoral work, while 
retaining a very flexible curriculum. All students must take one medieval or renaissance 
language. The selection ranges from Old Norse, Latin, medieval Italian 
and many more. Beyond this students are free to specialise or range as 
widely as they wish. Modules are often available in a range of full-year or half-year models, allowing for either preference. For those who do want the skills needed for doctoral work, a
 range of 'skills' modules are central: 'Renaissance Texts', 'The 
Medieval English Book' and 'Manuscripts and Documents' (described by our
 external examiner as 'a jewel in the crown'). Students taking the 
full-unit options on Latin or Manuscripts and Documents have twice as 
much teaching-time than in equivalent MAs. Finally, the dissertation provides the opportunity to apply
 these skills on independent research into primary sources, on a subject
 of students' choosing. There are a wide variety of funding opportunities open to 
MARS applicants, ranging from awards of full fees and maintenance 
scholarships to bursaries of several thousand pounds. The 
interdisciplinary nature of MARS means that we can enter applicants for 
numerous scholarships across the whole of UCL. In addition there is a 
specific Chattaway Bursary for medieval graduate students. For further 
details see the UCL funding website or contact the Programme and Admissions Assistant.  MARS is an interdepartmental, interfaculty MA currently run
 by the History Department. It draws on expertise across UCL. 
Archaeology, Classics, English, French, German, History, History of Art,
 Italian, Jewish & Hebrew Studies, Scandinavian Studies and the 
School of Slavonic and East European Studies all collaborate and 
contribute to the MARS MA. MARS students therefore have an exceptional 
range of modules and staff at their disposal. Students can consequently develop a course of study exactly appropriate to, and relevant, for themselves.

			© UCL 1999–2017 First stop, check out the degree homepage.
 On the degree homepage you will find the Degree Tutor, further details 
and the degree structure which lists all of the components of the degree
 and their weighting. Then you can check out the modules page and see 
what is available. These usually change from year to year, but
 it will give you a good sense of what sort of modules are on 
offer. The MARS degree is interdepartmental, with its administrative base in the department of History.Programmes Administration Team - You should contact this administration team within the History department for issues to do with module 
enrolment, general queries, or any practical issues concerning your 
degree.Degree Tutor - This is the leader of the MARS degree and acts as your Personal Tutor.  Module Tutor - Your first point of contact for questions specific to the module. You can apply online and in paper form,
 though we highly recommend applying online as it will be much easier 
and quicker to track your application (and the application fee is 
halved).For general application queries (including degree and English language requirements), click here! Usually at the end of July for September entry. Some funding will 
require that you have applied and been accepted by a particular date. 
If you are applying for funding you should check with the funding body. No. Provided you submit your application by the deadline, you will 
be considered for the programme.   Yes. However, you should use the personal statement section to explain why you wish to do 
the degree. You should also aim to show 
that, though you have no formal qualifications in the subject, you have a 
strong interest and have pursued the subject independently. In exceptional cases we may accept applicants with grades 
below the pre-requisite.  However, you will need to put forward a strong
 case. All such cases must be granted by the Dean of Students, so even 
if we support your application, we cannot guarantee your place. In the 
case of mature students, there may be slightly more leeway to account 
for changes in qualifications, but all such offers are still ultimately 
decided upon outside of the Department. Some students (usually those in the process of completing 
degrees when they apply) do not have transcripts sent out until the 
August before they are due to start their MA/PhD. You can make an 
incomplete application and be considered WITHOUT your transcripts. When
 prompted to attach your transcript(s) on the online application you can 
attach a document containing a brief explanation as to why you cannot do
 so, or a letter from your university with your marks achieved so far. This will then allow you to proceed and submit. However, we cannot issue an unconditional offer until all paperwork has been provided. We
 also cannot make an unconditional offer until your application is 
complete, including acceptable proof of language proficiency (where 
appropriate) and references. The part-time MA is the same programme as the full-time 
one, but spread over two years. Usually students will take between 60 and 90 credits' worth of taught modules in their first year. In the second year, students will then take between 30 and 60
credits' worth of modules and their dissertation.  However, students can arrange the weighting of taught modules over the 2 years to suit individuals' needs.   Taught modules are usually (but not always) two-hour seminars taught during 
the daytime. We do not teach in the evenings or at weekends. You can 
discuss modules choices with your Personal Tutor and create a programme of
 study that fits around your other commitments. We do not offer distance-learning courses and class attendance is compulsory.   Most modules are taught in two-hour seminars, once a week. 15 credit modules are generally for either term 1 OR term 2 and 30 
credit modules are generally (but not always) over both terms.   This depends on the module, so check by clicking on the relevant module on the modules homepage. Some modules may have an examination. However the majority of modules
 have 1 (15 credit) or 2 (30 credit)
 pieces of assessed coursework. Yes. As an interdepartmental degree, you are already free to take modules in all of the participating MARS departments, but you can choose modules outside of these too. Indeed one of the great advantages of the degree is that you have the opportunity to take modules from a huge range. We advise students to look at other UCL departmental webpages to 
see what is on offer. For some departments, you will need to seek 
permission before enrolling on a module. Some modules (usually because 
they are highly specialised) will not be open to students outside of the
 host department.


As part of your degree you can take modules at other University of London
institutions. If the module is not connected to your degree subject you
 will need to check the degree structure first. All module choices must
 be approved by your Personal Tutor first.Page last modified on 03 may 17 11:44
