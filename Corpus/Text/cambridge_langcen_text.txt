                      © 2017 University of CambridgeSpeaking PracticeThe Language CentreGroups meet for six sessions during Michaelmas and Lent terms (and during Easter term subject to demand) to discuss topics of cultural, international or general interest. Each group is  led by a native speaker who is there to help sustain momentum in conversation, encourage  debate and support with feedback on language. These are informal groups for  those who have independent conversational ability but would like to develop the  range and quality of their self-expression. In the French, German and Spanish Conversation  Hours learners take it in turns to select a conversation topic, send round a  web link to some pre-reading/listening material and draw up a short list of  simple questions for small group discussion during the session.The English groups are led by one of our ADTIS teachers and are available at Intermediate and Advanced level.University students, staff, their partners and  visiting scholars all welcome.We charge a small fee for these sessions; please click "join" to find out more.For information about the CEF levels referred to in the language details please check the CEFR Self Assessment Grid.A team of native speaker volunteers who will practice conversation and/or pronunciation in a language you are learning.Very informal and friendly, the volunteers offer 20-minute  sessions suitable for any level of learner.Languages currently available:A great way to improve your fluency and expand your vocabulary in a relaxed and supportive environment.         Nothing has boosted my confidence and enjoyment so much as having a Conversation Exchange partner.© 2017 University of CambridgeStudy abroadThe Language CentreIntensive study abroad can give you the ideal opportunity to  immerse yourself in a language, as well as the chance to travel and experience  a new country and its culture.  Students  often look back on these trips as some of their most formative and memorable  experiences, personally speaking as well as linguistically.  We are keen to give you the information and  encouragement to join them.Choosing a short course abroad can be both exciting and  daunting, which is why it helps to fully research your options. There are  several aspects to consider and it’s important to make an informed decision to  make the most of the experience.
 				    Mastering languages and studying abroad can change who you are in wonderful ways. Research has shown that learning languages strengthens cognitive skills, including problem solving and mental flexibility, while studying abroad also builds independence and confidence.You may like to consider one of the following.These offer you the chance to discuss your plans and find out about course and funding options.These sessions help you to:Drop in to our reception area to find out more about courses and previous student experiences.If you are a scientist, consider applying for a Pressland Bursary to help you with your plans.

We have  also had a fantastic volunteer for Igbo, who has given occasional support over the past couple of years to postgraduate students.If you can volunteer your help please contact enquiries@langcen.cam.ac.uk.Could you give an hour of your time each week to support  learners on a 1-to-1 basis with your native language?We would like to encourage friendships across countries and cultures by inviting native speakers to volunteer to help others. This could  involve helping somebody to practise or offering feedback that supports them to improve. At the same time the volunteer can gain initial experience in learner  support that would be useful for a career in education or a related field.If you could be a friend to a learner please contact enquiries@langcen.cam.ac.uk.Would you be able to help us with recordings?These can be useful for our CULP listening exams and  occasionally we may be looking for volunteers to make recordings in our course  languages.For some of our lesser known languages it can be difficult to find spoken representation and having recordings is very useful to learners  for initial exposure and training the ear. If you would like to be added to our recording volunteer list please contact enquiries@langcen.cam.ac.uk.Each year we have 550+ university members in our Language Volunteer Bank.© 2017 University of CambridgeBursaries & Grants for Graduate Language TrainingThe Language CentreSome language training for graduate students (the Academic Reading courses for students in the Schools of Arts & Humanities and Humanities & Social Sciences) is free at the point of delivery and no bursary application is required.
